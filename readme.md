# Text Analyzer

This project serves as the capstone to my studies at [Data Science Retreat](https://www.datascienceretreat.com/) cohort # 21.

What this collection of notebooks does it walk the user through the process of: 

## Scraping Websites
* [Workbook 0: Getting Search Pages](https://github.com/educatorsRlearners/book-maturity/blob/master/00_get_search_pages.ipynb)
* [Workbook 1: Getting Links to the Book Titles](https://github.com/educatorsRlearners/book-maturity/blob/master/01_get_title_links.ipynb)
* [Workbook 2: Collect Every Book Review](https://github.com/educatorsRlearners/book-maturity/blob/master/02_get_book_reviews.ipynb)
* [Workbook 3: Extract Details from Each Review](https://github.com/educatorsRlearners/book-maturity/blob/master/03_get_book_details.ipynb)

* conducting exploratory data analysis
* establishing a baseline
* creating models using 
     * XGBoost
     * LSTM
     * computer vision
     
While the bootcamp is finished, my work with this program will continue as I improve the structure of this repo. Please feel free to clone and submit pull requests.
