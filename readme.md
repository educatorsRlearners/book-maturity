# Text Analyzer

This project serves as the capstone to my studies at [Data Science Retreat](https://www.datascienceretreat.com/) cohort # 21.

What this collection of notebooks does it walk the user through the process of: 

## Data Collection - Scraping [Common Sense Media Book Reviews](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/book-reviews)
* [0: Getting Search Pages](https://github.com/educatorsRlearners/book-maturity/blob/master/00_get_search_pages.ipynb)

While the bootcamp is finished, my work with this program will continue as I improve the structure of this repo. Please feel free to clone and submit pull requests.
