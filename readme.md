# Text Analyzer

This project serves as the capstone to my studies at [Data Science Retreat](https://www.datascienceretreat.com/) cohort # 21.

What this collection of notebooks does it walk the user through the process of: 

* scraping websites
* cleaning data
* conducting exploratory data analysis
* establishing a baseline
* creating models using 
     * XGBoost
     * LSTM
     * computer vision
     
While the bootcamp is finished, my work with this program will continue as I improve the structure of this repo. Please feel free to clone and submit pull requests.
