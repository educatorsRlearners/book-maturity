"The Fates Divide: Carve the Mark, Book 2","Introspective, twist-filled finale explores love, destiny.","THE FATES DIVIDE: CARVE THE MARK, BOOK 2  -- the second and final installment in Veronica Roth's space-based duology -- picks up where Carve the Mark left off, with star-crossed lovers Cyra Noavek, who's Shotet, and Akos Kereseth, who's Thuhve, stuck on a spaceship with a motley crew of family, friends, and enemies, including Cyra's murderous captured brother Ryzek and Akos' oracle brother Eijeh. Akos and Cyra are both ""fated"" (subjects to prophecies): Akos is destined to die in service to Cyra's royal family. So when her bloodthirsty, tyrannical father Lazmet Novaek, previously thought dead, is discovered alive and rises to power again, Akos believes he's going to die a pawn to the Shotet ruler. The couple must find a way to overthrow Lazmet and save both of their tribes from mutual destruction.
","Roth's second book in the Carve the Mark duology is an introspective, romantic, character-based follow-up to the world-building of the first novel. There are some undeniable truths in this series: that Cyra and Akos love each other, that their fates are intertwined, that the Shotet and the Thuhve must learn to co-exist or risk annihilating one another. Roth approaches big themes from a personal perspective. In addition to Cyra's and Akos' points of view, this sequel includes Akos' siblings Eijeh's (the oracle whose mind was addled with Ryzek's memories) and Cisi's (who can shift others' moods) perspectives. Cyra's first-person chapters remain the most immediate and relatable, whereas Akos' third-person chapters swing between reflective and sympathetic to a bit slow.
Akos experiences a lot of growth, however, as does Cyra. [Spoiler] There's an interlude when the two aren't physically together, and it's heartbreaking but necessary for both of them to fulfill their destinies and save the world. Cyra and Akos must figure out whether their love is a choice or a foregone conclusion because of the prophecies about their lives. There's an almost biblical quality to their love story, as well as the complicated family dynamics surrounding the Noaveks and Kereseths in this second installment. Like Ruth and Naomi's ""Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people,"" Akos lovingly tells to Cyra: ""In case you hadn't noticed... I'll pretty much go with you anywhere.""","Parents need to know that The Fates Divide: Carve the Mark, Book 2 is the final book in best-selling author Veronica Roth's space fantasy duology. The twist-filled story includes even more fantasy violence and romance than its predecessor. There's murder (up close and personal) and mass military attacks that leave many dead. There are executions, imprisonment, and battles. The characters continue to exhibit their unique gifts that can persuade, torture, even kill. The slow-burn romance finally ignites in this installment, with the few kisses of the first book growing into full-blown passion and a couple of love scenes (but they aren't explicit). Language includes mild insults and a few uses of ""s--t."" The book continues to explore refreshingly unconventional gender roles, with Cyra the expert fighter and Akos the vulnerable healer. Some critics have pointed out problematic depictions of skin color and chronic pain, but that's open to interpretation. The story promotes the message that groups of people are more than the stereotypes about them and calls into question nurture vs. nature and the destructive effect of discrimination.

That's (Not) Mine,Funny twist on sharing (or not) is great for little kids.,"One comfy chair and two furry characters who have not yet learned to share spells trouble -- and chaos. Does the chair belong only to the one currently sitting in it, or does it belong to the other one who had it first? After a little trickery, some pushing and shoving, and a lot of yelling, the two creatures realize the silliness of their stubbornness; they apologize and find a better way to spend their time. ","Large, bright, expressive illustrations and simple text make this fun, silly story the perfect book for a kid just learning about sharing with friends and siblings. The characters are fuzzy and cuddly, the colors bright, and the presentation energetic. Anna Kang and her illustrator husband Christopher Weyant have come up with a clever twist with their (Not) stories that gives a fresh look to very basic problems kids encounter. Young kids and beginner readers especially will enjoy this story's humor and energy. ","Parents need to know that That's (Not) Mine is the second (Not) book by Anna Kang and illustrated by Christopher Weyant. The first, You Are (Not) Small, was named n ALA Notable Book and won the Theoddor Seuss Geisel Award in 2015. This one features the same two furry characters who are learning about (not) sharing. It's lighthearted and fun, especially for young kids and beginning readers.

The Rescue Princesses Series,Four princesses save animals using brains and bravery.,"In THE RESCUE PRINCESSES series, four young princesses who made a pact to help any animal in trouble set out on adventures to do just that. Princesses Emily, Clarabel, Lulu and Jaminta are inventors, train as ninjas, scale mountains, take risks, use their brains and physical strength, and advocate for animals. Their bravery is backed up by their royal parents, including the king who told them that they should work hard and be responsible, but must always think for themselves. The princesses save deer from poachers, an injured dolphin and tigers, protect the rare snow leopard and more -- all while learning that they are best when they trust one another other and always try their best
","These meaty, entertaining stories feature self-rescuing princesses who care deeply about one another nd don't care at all about hairstyles. These are no rote fairy tales of princesses pining for love or plunging into depression over a bad fashion choice. In each book, The Rescue Princesses set out to rescue an animal in distress, sometimes going against the wishes of the king, but always learning about compassion and friendship. The girls' adventures are complicated enough to hold an older reader's attention, but the vocabulary is simple enough not to intimidate younger readers.","Parents need to know that you get more than you'd expect from Paula Harrison's Rescue Princesses series. Don't let the fact that this is a tale of princesses fool you about the content of the stories. While the traditional trappings of princess life -- castles, ball gowns, an overemphasis on learning a proper curtsey -- are all here, these girls are no wallflowers. They are strong-willed, with the brains and brawn to back it up. Equally important, the girls support one another, and adults support their drive. The girls are told that everyone has a brain nd should use it. Not every princess has a maid who used to be an undercover agent, but in this progressive princess world, that kind of thing is no big deal.

Bright Before Sunrise,Opposites attract in fast-paced teen romance.,"In BRIGHT BEFORE SUNRISE, the main characters, Brighton Waterford and Jonah Prentiss, are each dealing with stress and loss in their lives in very different ways. Jonah has moved to wealthy Cross Pointe from the blue-collar town of Hamilton, 30 minutes away. He's cynical, surly, and feels everything at his new school highlights his outsider status. Jonah's father moved away and stopped contact with him after his parents' divorce, and his mother's and stepfather's new baby and new life in Cross Pointe seem to have pushed Jonah to the margins. Brighton's the most popular girl at Crosse Pointe High. She's nice and helpful to everyone and works hard to keep up a happy appearance, despite her near-constant sorrow over her dad's death five years earlier. Circumstances push Brighton and Jonah together for an extended evening. The two couldn't be more different on the outside and have heated interactions, each feeling the other will never like or accept the other. As the evening wears on into the early morning hours, Brighton and Jonah are finally honest with themselves and each other about the serious issues in their lives.
","The format of Bright Before Sunrise is one the most captivating qualities of the book. Brighton and Jonah alternate narrating each chapter in the first person. The alternating point of view hooks the reader: When one character details an occurrence in the course of the evening, you can't wait to see how the other character sees it. The novel has a classic opposites-attract storyline. Brighton's an involved over-achiever who's kind to everyone, and Jonah's a sullen, cynical outsider who doesn't want to interact with anyone at school.
The interactions between all the characters make the point that we should never assume we understand what people are like based on appearances. Kids who seem to have it all together often don’t, and those who act mean are often doing so because they are dealing with emotional pain. Unfortunately, the characters are clichés, and most of the conflicts in the book feel contrived or flimsy. The dialogue and character motivations feel unreal and forced, until the last quarter of the book, when the story resolves in a satisfying way. And while major personality transformations in an eight-hour span aren't all that believable, the device serves the purpose of feeding the excitement and romance of the story.","Parents need to know that Bright Before Sunrise is a coming-of-age romance about two teens who seem to be opposites, but who connect and find common ground after they stay out all night together. The main theme is that we can never truly know what personal struggles a person is dealing with by simply looking at the way they behave. The book presents issues of class, stereotyping, loss, and stress related to major life changes. Teens drink and have parties when parents aren't home. Graphic, first-person descriptions of kissing, groping, and sexual arousal. There are also scenes of parent-teen conflict.

Clean Getaway,"Boy and grandma's thrilling ride through U.S., family past.","When CLEAN GETAWAY begins, Scoob, an 11-year-old Black boy is in an RV with his White grandmother. She's invited him on a road trip. Scoob is grounded after being suspended from school, and his dad has canceled spring break plans. Traveling with G'ma is a welcome loophole. Scoob soon learns that G'ma has sold her house to buy the fancy Winnebago. They set off through the southern United States, often consulting G'ma's store of old maps and the Green Book, a guide African Americans used during the Jim Crow era to find lodging and eating places that would serve them. Scoob learns that they are following the route of an unfinished trip G'ma took with his grandfather back in the 1960s. Scoob appreciates that G'ma shares old photos nd previously secret family stories as well as some lessons about history. But something is off and his grandmother is cting strange. She drinks alcohol, which he's never known her to do. She sometimes seems lost in thought and calls him by her husband's name. She dines and dahes. He thinks, though he can't be sure, that he caught her shoplifting at a jewelry store. When she throws away her phone as they make their way to the Mexican border, he really gets worried.
","This multilayered page-turner is heartwarming and suspenseful. With every new development in Clean Getaway, readers learn more about the lives and emotions of Scoob and his grandmother. The tension rises steeply through one clever cliffhanger after another. A particular strength of the book is the way author Nic Stone weaves in civil rights history without ever seeming like she's lecturing or preaching: The conversations between the boy and his grandmother are realistic. She tells him anecdotes from her life, and then the two connect those stories and the sites they're seeing with his history lessons from school. Stone also does an excellent job of presenting this family as loving and supportive (and the boy as feeling loved), even as serious family problems are gradually revealed. She's previously published young adult novels, and this middle-grade debut is strong. Cartoon-style illustrations by Dawud Anyabwile do a great job reflecting the emotional depth of the text. This book could be a good choice for a reader who's relatively new to chapter books. It can also help parents, grandparents, or even older siblings share personal stories about historical events with young readers. Readers can talk about how current events affect their personal lives.","Parents need to know that Clean Getaway, by Nic Stone (Jackpot, Dear Martin, Odd One Out) nd illustrated by Dawud Anyabwilean, tells the story of 11-year-old Black boy William (""Scoob"") and his elderly White grandmother (""G'ma""), who run away from home in an RV. Scoob's strict single dad, Jimmy, grounded him after Scoob was suspended from school, so he's grateful to be invited on  road trip. G'ma, for unknown reasons, has sold her home to buy the luxurious Winnebago. The pair follow the route G'ma once traveled with Scoob's grandfather, Jimmy Sr., a Black man who died in prison. As the trip progresses, G'ma's behavior becomes stranger and stranger. She calls Scoob by her deceased husband's name, ditches and dines at a restaurant, and shoplifts jewelry. Then she throws her phone away so their movements can't be traced. There are brief mentions of violence from the civil rights era: the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. nd Medgar Evers and the murder of Emmett Till. There's one scene where an adult drinks shots of bourbon and then drives a vehicle.

Imogene's Last Stand,Tenacious girl fights to preserve her historical society.,"Imogene loves history and has since she was a tiny baby. Her favorite place in the whole wide world is the neglected Liddleville Historical Society set in a dusty forgotten building at the end of Main Street. Imogene works hard to clean the place up and get it ready for visitors, but nobody comes. Even worse, the city wants to knock down the building to make way for a shoelace factory! Can Imogene convince them that history matters more than shoelaces?
","Effortlessly including historical quotes throughout Imogene's dialogue, this book manages to be entertaining and educational. Imogene's plight and earnestness will have kids rooting for her even if they haven't given historical preservation a second thought. For kids who are intrigued, the book offers a way to learn more with front and end pages that showcase Imogene's inspirational heroes.
 The pen and ink illustrations are detailed as befits a book with lots of dusty artifacts in the background. Imogene's determination comes through, too, as the pictures effectively depict her stomping, shaking her fist, and hollering to be heard. With her brown bob and high spirits, she looks a little bit like a studious version of Beverly Cleary's Ramona.
There is lots of detail in the well-wrought scenery and Imogene's determination comes through loud and clear in every picture.","Parents need to know that Imogene is a girl with a mission. While she does protest the loss of the local historical society, her actions are appropriate acts of civil disobedience.

"Fireblood: The Frostblood Saga, Book 2",Twisty sequel with vengeful god and a fiery female hero.,"In FIREBLOOD, Ruby is not getting on so well in the Frostblood court, despite being a clear favorite of the Frostblood king, Arcus. Older members of the court shun her, calling her ""Firefilth"" behind her back. It doesn't matter to them that she saved them all from the Minax, a creature that possessed the last Frostblood king and his throne, turning him into a bloodthirsty tyrant. Even with this opposition, Arcus continues to work for peace, calling on dignitaries from around the kingdoms to sign an accord at the Frostblood castle. All goes horribly wrong at a ball in the dignitaries' honor, when masked Frostbloods attack and injure Arcus. In the melee, Ruby gets separated from Arcus and meets a Fireblood prince in disguise, a handsome rogue named Kai. Kai offers to take Ruby to the forbidden Fireblood kingdom across the sea to meet the queen. Ruby knows this is her only hope of stopping more bloodshed, frost and fire alike. The Minax she removed from the Frostblood court is loose, and another of the warmongering creatures is said to live in the Fireblood throne, potentially corrupting the Fireblood queen. It's up to her to find a way to kill them both.
","While the character reflection could use some tightening at times, overall this is an engrossing sequel with a strong, hem, fiery female hero and intriguing plot twists. As more and more is heaped on Ruby, the hero -- trials with lava, sacrifices, surprise new identities, and yet more surprise new identities -- she's got much to grapple with and sort out. Ruby's reflection adds to the depth and intrigue of the story at times, and at others it loses focus, or finds three focuses too many.
Fireblood does pick back up quickly enough, however, with some surprising twists in all the right places. And much about the mythology of the story becomes clearer, making this saga feel more saga-like when you throw vengeful gods and their minions into the mix. And there's a war to stop, and generations of Frostblood-Fireblood animosity to face. Altogether, a pretty stellar setup for the finale.","Parents need to know that Fireblood is the second fantasy book in the Frostblood Saga, in which a constant race war rages between those who can wield ice -- Frostbloods -- and those who can wield fire -- Firebloods. There's no arena fighting like in the first book, Frostblood, but there's still much fighting with frost and fire magic here -- some swords and daggers, too. Expect some deaths, but only injuries suffered by main characters. There's a trial with a lava pit and scorpions that sting and cause pain and weakness. Also, people turn violent and merciless when possessed by a creature unleashed by a vengeful god. Two people are possessed, carried away, and possibly dead. There's talk of murders in villages, and the mass execution of Frostbloods and Firebloods after such possession. Consistent with the start of the Frostblood Saga, Fireblood focuses on overcoming darkness, evil, and corrupt power and finding lightness and good.

Malala's Magic Pencil,Nobel winner tells what inspired activism in relatable tale.,"MALALA'S MAGIC PENCIL begins with Malala s a schoolgirl watching  TV show about a boy with a magic pencil. She wishes she had a magic pencil to get her family the things they want, but it never materializes. Then she sees other kids in her neighborhood forced to dig through trash to support their families, and her sense of social justice deepens. When the Taliban forbids girls to go to school, she begins to write and speak out, traveling around Pakistan, and drawing international attention and support. The Taliban tries to ""silence"" her, but Malala persists, even speaking at the United Nations. She says she at last ""finds the magic I was looking for -- in my words and in my work.""
","You can't ask for a better female role model than young Pakistani education advocate Malala Yousafzai, and this picture book autobiography's a perfect introduction. Malala's Magic Pencil is told in her voice and focuses on her childhood, making her relatable. She wants a magic pencil like she saw on TV so she can ""put a lock on my door so my brothers couldn't bother me,"" and draw ""a proper ball, so my brothers and I no longer had to play with an old sock stuffed with rubbish."" But when Malala speaks out for education, adults will understand from the illustration that she's speaking on an international stage and at the United Nations, nd will know the horrific story of how the Taliban shot her. The book wisely allows families to choose how to introduce the more violent and upsetting details.
The art is by Kerasoët, a pseudonym for a husband-wife illustration duo, and it's hugely appealing, giving glimpses of Pakistani life and culture. Malala looks like the smart, strong girl most kids would want to be friends with. Though the text never mentions she's Muslim, Malala's pictured wearing a headscarf whenever she's outside. And while her magic pencil draws her wishes in gold, we see the dusty streets, some buildings in rubble, and the ""dangerous men"" on the street with weapons slung over their shoulders. Biographical notes and photos give the story deeper context.","Parents need to know that Malala's Magic Pencil is by Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani girl whose work as an education activist gained international recognition, and who was the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. There are a slew of kids' books about this inspirational young hero, but this one is by Malala herself, and it focuses on her childhood, offering the sort of personal details that make her early life highly accessible to young readers. The violent attack against her -- when she was shot by the Taliban -- is handled gently and indirectly for the age group, saying only that ""dangerous men tried to silence me, but they failed."" The book's a powerful introduction to this young, contemporary Muslim female role model and her work.

Posted,"Realistic, moving story of finding courage to be yourself.","In POSTED, Frost regards his friends as a tribe of misfits -- a budding poet, a benchwarmer, a Dungeons & Dragons enthusiast, and a music prodigy -- protecting each other from the wolves in middle school. But that starts to change with the arrival of Rose, a bright, bold girl built like a linebacker. She latches on to Frost's tribe, throwing his friendships off-balance. Meanwhile, his friend Deedee reacts to the school's new cell phone ban by leaving sticky notes instead of sending texts. The idea spreads, but soon the proliferating notes escalate to a cruel sticky note war. Frost's tribe is caught in the middle of it. Normally they'd just lie low and try to avoid trouble, but that isn't Rose's style -- she thinks it's time they fight back.
","Author John David Anderson offers words of comfort and hope in his insightful portrayal of middle school pressures -- to be liked yet to be yourself, while weighing the risk in every interaction. Through the eyes of the young poet in Posted, he focuses on the power of words: to wound, to protect, to heal. He exposes the casual cruelty of middle schoolers without flinching, but also shows how compassion and strength can still shine brightly.
Frost is a strong narrator, sharing his affection for his quirky friends as well as his self-consciousness about his tribe, and his sometimes regrettable behavior when it comes to Rose. No one gets through the stormy seas of middle school unscathed, Anderson makes clear, but he shows kids how they can steer their own course. A terrific read for jocks, misfits, popular kids, and nerds alike.
 ","Parents need to know that Posted is a nuanced story by John David Anderson (Ms. Bixby's Last Day) about friendship and the power of words -- to harm and to help -- as students respond to their middle school's new cell phone ban by leaving sticky notes instead of sending texts. Kids are verbally bullied and physically harassed for their appearance, ethnicity, and passions. Students settle scores with a treacherous bike stunt, lying to adults about injuries and damaged bikes. One boy is deeply hurt by his parents' divorce and another has parents who fight bitterly. Though the book is marketed for ages 8 and older, we think the middle school context and subtle, bullying homophobic slurs make this more appropriate for kids 10 and up.

I Survived Series,"Riveting, emotional historical fiction for young readers.","The I SURVIVED series follows children navigating some of the most memorable disasters of our time. From the eruption of Pompeii and the sinking of the Titanic, to the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the Joplin, Missouri, tornado, this series describes the sights, smells, and sentiments of life before, during, and after each chaotic moment. The kids take cover in a ditch to avoid burning wind from the Mount St. Helens volcanic eruption, or help orphans escape the Chicago fire, or watch Titanic sink in the freezing ocean. Readers are dropped into the lives of kids their own age, into disasters they've likely never faced.
","Since we already know that each of these disasters is, well, a disaster, the beauty of these books is in the enthralling storytelling. The I Survived series is about epic disasters, but it also tells the human stories that are glossed over in history books. Many of the kids in the stories have recently lost a parent, adding another emotional layer to the terror they face navigating the 1871 Chicago fire, or the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. These stories are fast-paced, tense, full of accurate historical details, and show kids' bravery and resilience. ","Parents need to know that Lauren Tarshis's I Survived series is captivating, emotional, and historically accurate. The kids in these stories face scary situations in their first-person accounts of the disasters; they're often alone, hurt, and in an unfamiliar place. But because almost everyone around them is trying to help the kids survive or find their parent, once the worst is over, the overall feeling from the books is optimistic. The end of each story of survival gives a glimpse into the post-disaster life of the family and ends with an upbeat note.

The Book with No Pictures,No pictures but oodles of silly words and giggles.,"The narrator speaks directly to the reader, saying that it probably seems as if a book with no pictures will be ""boring and serious. Except ... Here's how books work: Everything the words say, the person reading the book has to say. No matter what."" So as the pages turn, the reader has to say words such as ""BLORK"" and ""BLUURF"" and must read in a monkey voice, then a robot voice, per the instructions. Only a few words per page in different colors and type size add to the fun, including the giant red name of a hippo: ""BOO BOO BUTT."" The reader must sing and make all kinds of silly sounds, too. The book ends with the narrator telling the reader, ""Next time, please please please please please choose a book with pictures. Please? Because this is just too ridiculous to read."" And then he throws in one more red ""BONK.""
","Author B.J. Novak hilariously proves his point: that a book with only words can be s amusing and engaging as one with images. THE BOOK WITH NO PICTURES is super silly and very clever as it panders to young kids' love of funny sounds, made-up words, and undignified words such as ""butt."" Novak's comic timing is impeccable, his tone light. Kids will delight in seeing their parents or teachers compelled to say ridiculous things such as, ""Yes, I am a monkey"" and ""my head is made of blueberry pizza."" This radical non-picture book goes a long way toward fostering a love of reading -- robot voice optional. ","Parents need to know that The Book with No Pictures, by actor/comedian/screenwriter B.J.

One plan after another fails until finally the princess pitches in to help, proving it sometimes takes more than bravery and wit to solve a problem. 
","The illustrations in this book make it a real keeper. Readers of all ages will find the artwork both captivating and original. And the story is a classic.  A slightly altered version of one of Aesop's fables, it's updated by the addition of the princess, her castle, and an upstairs/downstairs scenario that includes mischievous and pampered pool-playing cats and a game of hockey. The artwork is intriguing, and the idea behind it is uniquely creative. Each colorfully ornate page is a photograph of an actual set built by von Buhler out of wood and plaster, and filled with miniature props. The characters are painted on paper, cut out, and placed in the scenes that she built.",Parents need to know that this story is based on one of Aesop's fables.

Dylan the Villain,"Clever, smart, diabolically fun story of kid supervillain.","In DYLAN THE VILLAIN, Mr. and Mrs. Snivel are surprised to give birth to a baby with a purple bandit mask barely disguising the villainous glint in his eye. But like all good parents, they're game and super-supportive of their little supervillain, praising his costumes, supervillain laugh, and supervillain inventions. He's the apple of their eye, even if the apple is rotten to the core. Dylan agrees with them that he's ""the cleverest super-villain in the whole wide world,"" so he's surprised when he goes off to school and meets Addison Van Malice, a classmate who bests him at every villainous turn. When the teacher announces a diabolical robot contest, Dylan manages to win the trophy but only because he accidentally-on-purpose blasts Addison and her (much better) robot into space. Bwa-ha-ha! But when he breaks out in an allergic reaction, we see that Allison is responsible, and the book ends on a cliffhanger -- is she plotting her next move?
","A rollicking fun story to tickle the inner villain who resides in us all, this book about a little supervillain getting good at his game is chock-full of humor in the very clever art and text. Readers will root for young Dylan as, in the pursuit of villainy, he makes household messes rivaling ones every kid makes and deals with, and they'll relate to the school rivalries. They'll also laugh at his parents, doting but dumbfounded as his supervillain invention leaves them literally in the dust. The story offers well-behaved kids a safe outlet to enjoy the fantasy of acting out. Since the villainy is silly and cartoony, they probably won't grow up plotting world domination.
Both the main little villains are white, but there are other little villains of color, and it's the girls who come out on top in this story, since supervillain Addison Van Malice is top in her class and constructs the biggest, baddest, most diabolical robot of all. Dylan just can't get ahead of her, even when he blasts her and her robot into space. There's so much humor in both the story and art that this book will continue to serve up pleasure over multiple readings.","Parents need to know that Dylan the Villain, by K.G. Campbell (illustrator of Newbery winner Flora & Ulysses: The Illuminated Adventures), is a great picture book choice for fans of The Incredibles and other smart, fun stories about totally relatable kids and families who just happen to be superheroes -- or, in this case, supervillains. Little Dylan is born to ""normal"" parents who support and cheer on the supervillain traits he excels at, but at school he's outmatched by a girl who's every bit as conniving and who builds a much better robot. If the story upholds villainy -- Dylan eliminates his rival by blasting her into space -- it's cartoon villainy, all in good fun and hilariously silly. And there's lots of value in the girl being the one to beat. She's the best inventor and engineer and doesn't shy away from competition.

Demon Dentist,"Grisly, wicked romp has touches of Dahl and dark humor.","After a terrible dental visit, Alfie has managed to avoid going to the dentist. It's been easy to hide appointment reminders from his father, an unemployed, ailing former coal miner. But a well-meaning social worker has begun to check on Alfie's impoverished home, and getting him to a dentist is her top priority. Unfortunately for Alfie, the new dentist in town is the creepy Ms. Root, who hands out toothpaste so strong it burns through stone. On top of that, children in town who leave teeth for the tooth fairy are finding grisly surprises instead of coins when they wake. Alfie and his new friend, Gabz, suspect the new dentist might have something to do with it.
","Actor David Walliams' fiendishly fun novel invites comparison to the work of Roald Dahl with its dark humor, dumb grown-ups, and squiggly art. (The latter, by Tony Ross, evokes the work of longtime Dahl collaborator Quentin Blake.) DEMON DENTIST doesn't live up to the genius of their best work, but children who enjoy their style will shiver and snicker through Walliams' wicked romp.
His witch is deliciously creepy, insisting children call her ""Mummy"" and cooing over bad teeth. Walliams makes good use, too, of running gags, such as Texting Boy, who misses all the action. But some of the humor aims uncomfortably low, particularly with Winnie: A black social worker with a heart of gold, she has a sensitive gastrointestinal system and is mocked for her size, greediness, accent, and loud style. One drawing shows her stripped to her underwear after squeezing through a too-small space. (Two other women's bottoms are played for laughs, as well, including another case of underwear exposure.) Kids will squeal, but parents may squirm.","Parents need to know that Demon Dentist is a devilishly grisly fantasy that features two terrifying dentists. (Children who are already skittish about dental exams should skip this one.) English author (and actor) David Walliams relishes the over-the-top, grisly embellishments: rusty and savage dental tools, a cat that licks blood off freshly pulled teeth, a freshly plucked pig's eyeball, still twitching. There are some sad undercurrents -- Alfie and his dying father are very poor and socially isolated -- but there's great warmth to the story, as well. Three special people in Alfie's life are affectionately attentive to his small family. The book retains a very British feel, keeping U.K. terms such as ""surgery"" for a medical office and incorporating British sweets, but American kids will catch on quickly. There's a fair amount of potty humor and cheap laughs at the expense of an overweight woman.

"The Second Spy: The Books of Elsewhere, Book 3","Third in series serves up mix of magic, suspense, and heart.","When Olive discovers the recipes for magical paints that can bring whatever she creates to life, she mixes up a batch of colors. Her plan is to bring back the parents of her friend Morton, who was once a human child but who has been trapped in a painting for decades -- and is awfully lonely. But not only does Olive create monstrosities, she also inadvertently delivers the paint recipes into the hands of Aldous McMartin, the evil witch who has also been hiding in a painting, and is determined to take back his house. To save her life and the ones she loves, Olive is going to need all her allies, including Morton, the three talking cats, and Rutherford, a smart neighbor boy with a magical secret of his own.
","This third installment in The Books of Elsewhere series is a fun, suspenseful fantasy, and readers will find themselves squirming throughout Olive's new adventures. Initially, they will wiggle with embarrassment as Olive delivers her terrible parental portraits to Morton (""Olive eyed her work, trying to convince herself that Mrs. Nivens didn't look like a big black funnel with a head and torso dribbling backward out of the top."" ) Later, readers will fidget with fear as Olive faces off against terrifying painting of a young Aldous McMartin, who threatens her and the three talking cats fans have come to love throughout this series.
Readers will cheer as Olive and her friends -- furry and otherwise -- learn to trust and depend on each other in this volume. And they will be thrilled when author West  concludes this volume with plenty of possibilities for future installments. After all, readers just learned about Rutherford's magical gift, Morton's parents remain missing, and Aldous' witchy granddaughter is still on the loose. ","Parents need to know that The Second Spy is the third installment in the popular middle-grade series The Books of Elsewhere. It takes place in a scary old stone house, where painted people and other creatures can come to life and stalk the halls. In one frightening face-off, witch Aldous McMartin traps Olive in a pit inside of painting -- where she herself will soon turn to paint (""Once you have changed to paint and no longer need to breather, or eat, or drink, you can remain down there in the darkness forever ... without even the possibility of death to set you free."") In this third volume, Olive continues to make mistakes, but this time around her heart's really in the right place. In the end, she's able to express her love to Horatio, a talking cat, and help him realize that his life has meaning. There's also a sweet message about being honest and loyal to the loved ones in your life, even when times get hard (or someone threatens to trap you in a painting).

Better Nate Than Ever,Terrific tale of misfit taking bold step to remake his life.,"Eighth-grader Nate Foster is a boy in love with Broadway but stuck in small-town western Pennsylvania, a misfit in a family that values sports and God. While his parents spend a weekend away to try to save their marriage, Nate's best friend Libby helps him execute a crazy plan: to sneak off to New York City to try out for E.T.: The Musical and return home before his parents notice. New York City is more amazing than he dreamed -- and the auditions more excruciating. Through heartache, joy, fear, and wild hope, Nate takes the biggest chance of his young life and has an adventure that changes his life in ways he didn't expect.
","Tim Federle's first novel, BETTER NATE THAN EVER, is fresh and funny, a joyful story for anyone who's felt like a misfit (which is just about everyone). What sets Nate apart and targets him for ridicule in Jankburg, Pa., makes him stand out -- winningly -- at the auditions.
It's also a celebration of New York City, capturing the thrill of a first encounter with the city in all its craziness -- much like the rush teens feel when they enjoy a taste of real independence. Federle nails the voice of a witty 13-year-old with one foot firmly planted in childhood and the other tentatively toeing toward adulthood. Nate chatters excitedly, sometimes doubling back to fill in gaps even as he shares the latest developments. The energetic storytelling crackles with smart one-liners and quirks fans will embrace. Nate's a lovable hero for misfits and dreamers everywhere, and especially for young gay teens and kids who, like Nate, aren't ready to declare anything about their sexuality. ","Parents need to know that Better Nate Than Ever is a charming story of a boy who sneaks away from home and falls in love with New York City. He takes his brother's fake ID and his mom's ATM card and lies to adults. His conscience weighs on him, but he's focused on his goal: to audition for a Broadway musical. While Nate says his sexuality remains ""undecided,"" he's routinely bullied for being gay and shows some interest in boys. His family has had problems with alcoholism and infidelity. The publisher recommends this title for ages 9 and older: We recommend 10 and up due to the mature themes and language. It can be a good choice for younger kids, but risks introducing anti-gay slurs to more sheltered kids.

Nation,Philosophical survival story with a bit of humor.,"In a world very similar to ours in the pre-industrial era, a tsunami wipes out a south-Pacific island tribe except for one boy, Mau; and a British girl, Ermintrude, is the only survivor of a shipwreck on that island. Together they help care for other refugees who arrive on the island, learn about one another's culture and language, and prepare for the inevitable coming of the cannibal Raiders, who may be helped by mutineers set adrift from Ermintrude's ship before it was wrecked.
","Fans of author Terry Pratchett's other books for children may be surprised by this one. Instead of Discworld, the setting is mostly in the south Pacific a couple of centuries ago. Missing is the riotous humor (though Pratchett being Pratchett, there is always some wit and cleverness) and the fantasy elements. In their place is some pretty deep thinking about the natures and relationships among men and women, gods, and civilizations. Rarely has Pratchett so clearly shown his warm, humanist nature, nor so firmly taken his readers hand in hand down a path towards thinking more deeply about their common humanity. This should be a favorite in literature circles and discussion groups.
All of that philosophy, though, comes at the expense of some of the action, and there are places in this book that bog down a bit; after the exciting opening chapters, the real plot only happens in the second half. But the reader is carried along by some of Pratchett's best characters ever, most especially Mau and Ermintrude. There is little more enthralling than watching young people wrestle with doing the right thing while trying to get a grip on reality. This book may not have everything Pratchett's young fans have learned to expect in his books, but they may get something else they hadn't bargained for.
From the Book:""Are you from the government?"" the captain snapped.
Mr. Black looked surprised. ""The government? I am afraid not. Just between us, there is little of the government left at the moment, and what there is is mostly hiding in its cellars. No, to be honest with you, the government has always found it convenient not to know much about us, and I would advise you to do the same.""","Parents need to know that the climax of the story is a fight to the death between a man and a young teen, in which the man shoots at and injures the boy. Children kill adults with poison and axes, and a plot point involves the making and drinking of beer.

Donutheart,"Funny, moving, loving portrait of a neurotic boy.","In this sequel to Donuthead, Franklin is now in middle school. He's still obsessed with germs and safety, is starting to notice girls, and has to deal with public bathrooms.
Franklin and Sarah continue to help each other. Sarah guards the bathroom for him, and Franklin helps her with skating and school. But things aren't going well in Sarah's life, and she and her deadbeat father begin hinting that they won't be staying around much longer.
","Try to ignore the hideous cover and the silly, pointless title; Sue Stauffacher's characters are so lovingly drawn, in all their quirkiness, that the reader falls in love with them, too. In real life, someone like Franklin might be irritating and weird, but as the author allows us inside his head, his quirks and obsessions become endearing, and readers can easily see past them into his large heart.
In fact, heart -- as the title indicates -- is what this book is about: Franklin's heart, enlarging as he learns to see beyond his own worries; the hearts of the adults, who see what is happening to Sarah and are powerless to do much about it; and Sarah's heart, held so tightly protected, that opens like a flower when she skates. It's also about the author's heart, which she shares so generously; and, most especially, about the reader's heart, which will be touched and expanded by this delightful, funny, poignant -- but never sentimental -- book.","Parents need to know that in this sequel to Donuthead, Sarah's father drinks, smokes, and is possibly abusive, though nothing is described. Also, Franklin is the product of a sperm donor -- young readers may ask what that is.

Flying Solo,"Funny, real, and powerfully moving.","When the substitute for Mr. Fabiano's sixth grade class calls in sick, her message is misplaced in the hectic office, and the children find themselves without a teacher. Rather than tell anyone, the students decide to run the class themselves. They know the schedule -- who needs adults? \""What could possibly happen? This school is crawling with teachers.\""
	But powerful emotions are brewing under the seemingly ordinary surface; this is the six-month anniversary of the death of a classmate, Tommy, who was often teased for his slowness, and Rachel has been mute ever since his death. And it is Bastian's last day before moving away.
","Ralph Fletcher teaches writing, and he teaches teachers how to teach writing; here, he shows that he knows what he's talking about. Written in simple language, this is a tour de force with an emotional climax and some big questions left at the end for readers to wrestle with.
The children in this class are vividly alive, each a three-dimensional person with strengths and faults, all of which will be recognizable to child readers. As they bicker their way through the day they achieve, almost in spite of themselves, something they're proud of, though their parents and school are horrified by what they have done. Though the teacher, Mr. Fabiano, appears only at the end, his presence is felt on every page -- it's a portrait, both brilliant and realistic, of a truly gifted teacher. Funny, real, and powerfully moving, this exceptional novel will leave both students and teachers with a lot to think about.","Parents need to know that there are some good moral issues to discuss here, and some powerful insights into people and the reasons why they act the way they do.

Here Comes Valentine Cat,Cat drops anti-dog bias in funny friendship tale.,"Cat is in a '""No-Valentines Zone"" because he thinks it's too mushy.

The narrator suggests he give one to the dachshund on the other side of his fence to welcome him to the neighborhood. But Cat assumes Dog is mean because he's thrown bones and a ball over the fence and hit Cat on the head. But after Dog sends Cat a valentine over the fence, Cat realizes the other items were gifts and makes his own card for Dog.
","Cat learns to drop his prejudice and open up to his neighbor in this cute Valentine's Day story.

The jokes are light and funny, as Cat once again conquers his negative tendencies.

But when Bianca starts talking to Wesley about real life, instead of just sleeping with him, she discovers she might not hate him quite so much after all. ","You can understand why movie execs decided to put this on the big screen; the premise is pretty fun, if formulaic and far-fetched, nd this book certainly has some steamy moments. Like, really steamy. Some readers may not quite buy the subplot about Bianca's father, who has a rapid relapse and an equally quick recovery from alcoholism. And parents might want to help teen readers analyze the whole fantasy about turning a big-time jerk into the kind of guy who sends long-stemmed roses and romantic notes.
But there's some serious heat coming off these two fiery protagonists, making The DUFF a fun beach read. And even the most cynical of readers will appreciate Bianca's great friends nd her gradual understanding that ""every girl feels unattractive sometimes.""  ","Parents need to know The DUFF: (Designated Ugly Fat Friend)  is a romantic young adult book about feisty Bianca, who ends up falling in love with Wesley, a boy she hates -- but can't help hooking up with.

Shipwreck at the Bottom of the World: The Extraordinary True Story of Shackleton and the Endurance,Survival saga of attempted Antarctic crossing.,"This is the incredible survival saga of Ernest Shackleton, who attempted to cross the Antarctic continent in 1914, and who, with his crew of twenty-seven, ended up trapped in an ice pack for seven months.
When their ship was finally crushed by the ice, Shackleton and crew survived another five months on the moving ice floes, traveled through storm-tossed seas to an uninhabited island, and were finally rescued, two years after they had set out, when Shackleton and five crew members traveled eight hundred miles in an open boat to get help. Not a man was lost. Includes maps, bibliography, and index.
","This unbelievable story -- the subject of numerous books, articles, and even a museum exhibition -- is enhanced by Jennifer Armstrong's breathtaking prose. From the spellbinding introduction through the epilogue, it is her writing as much as the story that rivets the reader's attention. The tale is a testament to the old-fashioned virtues that made the British such great explorers during the height of their Empire. Courage, fortitude, perseverance, good cheer and humor in the face of disaster, and that uniquely British trait called the ""stiff upper lip"" are all on display, as the crew endures the most punishing setbacks yet ultimately triumphs.

Chameleons Are Cool,Simple yet beguiling look at chameleons.,"This simple yet beguiling introduction to one of the world's most wondrous and strange (and, inexplicably, endearing) lizards ably describes the reptiles, covering their more peculiar behavior and their distribution. The book is vividly illustrated by Sue Shields in the fanciful colors chameleons prefer.
 ","You have to hand it to Martin Jenkins for creating a natural-science book that can be successfully deployed with preschoolers. The text emphasizes chameleon facts that grab kids' interest -- changing colors, wild rotating eyes, and just plain wild noses, their grumpiness, and their slow approach, followed by a lightning-quick zap of their quarry -- while the illustrations are as Technicolor bright as the tropics.
One slight drawback is Jenkins' occasional pandering to readers, starting with ""Chameleons are cool."" The inclusion of a young boy in the artwork, in aviator glasses and with his hat on backward, also seems a bit obvious. When this book was read to a library class of 5-year-olds, they immediately began to act grumpy and stick their tongues out at one another.

Demonglass (A Hex Hall Novel),Second installment in witchy series is darker but still fun.,"When Sophie Mercer discovers she is not a witch but actually a demon, she and her vampire friend Jenna travel to London for a removal ceremony that will rid Sophie of her powers. While in London, Sophie spends time learning her family history with her father, the head of Prodigium (the collective name for shapeshifters, witches, and faeries) -- and slowly accepts that with better control, her magical powers can actually help people in need. When Sophie runs into her first love, demon-hunter Archer Cross, Sophie's father forbids her to ever see him again, and the story takes on a Romeo and Juliet-esque turn. But there's still plenty of fantasy and intrigue, including an unexpected ghost and some mysterious disappearances.
","DEMONGLASS is darker than Hex Hall, but is every bit as witty and fun for tween readers. In addition to battles and romance, this installment features a fashion duel: A demon magically changes Sophie's khaki pants and t-shirt into a white bunny outfit, and she fights back by quickly dressing the gentleman in a pink tutu. More fun comes when the girls visit a London nightclub and witness their English teacher -- vampire and poet Lord Byron -- dancing with another bloodsucker. When he sees the girls he ""flips them the bird"" and walks away with his nose in the air, and Sophie admits that she and Jenna were hardly the desirable scholarly students. These clever touches -- mixed with a feisty heroine, doomed love, and some intriguing mystery -- will leave readers thirsting for the next installment.","Parents need to know that this sequel is a bit darker than Hex Hall, the first in the series.

"," While kids will find lots of detailed information here, the presentation is strangely lacking. Photographs, while beautiful, aren't well captioned, informational graphics are rare and uninspired, and the text is presented in large, dense blocks with no headings. The language is matter-of-fact and challenging, which bright kids will appreciate, but the lack of display type, graphics, and sidebars make it especially difficult to draw in less enthusiastic readers. That's a shame, because there's much to learn and marvel at in this series. Older children will get more out of these; all but the most curious younger kids will enjoy the pictures and lose interest in the text.
 Our Solar System
Simon paints a beautiful portrait of each planet, comparing and contrasting with Earth to help kids get a solid grasp of the information. This tour of our solar system is one of his meatiest books, touching on ancient beliefs, current science, and the question of whether life exists elsewhere. Global Warming
Simon focuses on how human activity is affecting global climate (though he notes that the planet might be in a natural warming cycle), and explains how small changes in climate can have major impacts on people and wildlife. He closes by touching on ways people -- from families to nations -- might be able to slow the trend.
Dolphins
These personable creatures are a fascinating subject, and Simon explores their social behavior, communication, and hunting and feeding techniques before detailing several species. He leaves readers with some tips for helping to protect dolphins and porpoises.

This is not just a psychological exploration, however: It's an adventure story, and the boys' odyssey is filled with enough peril and narrow escapes to keep readers engaged.","Parents need to know that In Navigating Early is an adventure novel by Clare Vanderpool, author of the Newbery Award-winning Moon Over Manifest. Set shortly after the end of World War II, it follows a grieving eighth grader named Jack, who's sent to boarding school after his mother dies. During spring break, Jack and his new friend Early embark on a quest along the Appalachian Trail without letting any grown-ups know. On their journey, they search for Early's missing brother and the Great Appalachian Bear, and they encounter some men who threaten them with a gun. The sense of real danger is tempered by parallels to the story of Pi that Early tells Jack, which gives their quest a mythical, heroic quality.

A Little Princess,"Girl's vivid imagination, kindness enrich all-time classic.","Sara Crewe, a motherless child who has been raised in India by her wealthy, doting father, is enrolled in Miss Minchin's Select Seminary for Girls, a boarding school in London. She is afforded every luxury, and the other students call her \""princess\""; some use the term out of awe and affection, while others are bitterly jealous of her. When Sarah is suddenly left penniless, she is relegated to the life of a servant in a cold, lonely attic room, but her always brilliant imagination becomes her saving grace. Throughout, she remains a magnanimous \""princess,\"" who feels best when she is helping others; the wonderful stories she invents, and her kind heart, earn her true friends and eventually lead her to a new home.
","A LITTLE PRINCESS is a beautifully crafted novel that celebrates the power of imagination. Sara Crewe is a bright, inventive, and generous young heroine, and female readers will connect with her strongly despite the book's old-fashioned language and setting. In fact, there is something wonderfully compelling about Sarah's attic room, which is transformed from cold blankness to a magical place via Sara's -- and author Frances Hodgson Burnett's -- stories.
The book is almost exclusively populated with girls and women, with the exception of Crewe's briefly seen father and her kind neighbors, so it may not appeal to boys as much as it does to girls. (Boys may enjoy Burnett's The Secret Garden, however, which features great boy characters.)","Parents need to know that Burnett's novel is a beautiful, fanciful, old-fashioned story with a complex heroine. The book is sweet and uplifting throughout, but Sara does suffer a terrible loss and is ill-treated by Miss Minchin, which could upset very young children. This classic novel also contains some old-fashioned attitudes. Becky asks if a new neighbor is a ""Chinee"" because his skin is ""yellow."" Sara recalls her time living in India, where she had an ""ayah who adored her,"" and servants bowed to her. These passages carry a note of racial stereotyping, but Sara's goodness to all people overshadows her outmoded perspective. The novel has been made into two very good movies: the 1939 version starring Shirley Temple, and a lovely remake from 1995. Though neither film is true to the plot of the book, both versions are wonderful and faithful to the spirit of Burnett's story and characters.

Bright, colorful illustrations add charm and interesting detail.
 ","This is an important introduction to the inspiring life of Bessie Coleman. Watercolors by Yvonne Buchanan are light and breezy, with a sense of Coleman flying on many of the pages.

The Other Ones,Teen doesn't want magic powers -- hard to believe!,"Bridget has a magical heritage. She can see what normal people cannot, including tree spirits and xiii, her own personal threshold guardian, who warns her of impending trouble and urges her to accept her powers. But Bridget, already a bullied misfit at school, believes that accepting her powers will make her even more of an outcast.
Meanwhile, the dramas of high school go on: her friend has been abandoned by his father, she enters an art contest, a boy likes her, a bully menaces her and her few friends.
","There's little that's believable here, from the cardboard cutout characters (magic people good, almost everyone else bad) to the absurd premise. As desperate as teens can be to fit in, it will be hard for most readers to credit, or sympathize with, a character who rejects magic powers so she'll seem normal. Just once wouldn't it be nice to read a story where a character enjoys the gift of magic, glories in it, has fun with it, just as any real person would do?
Author Jean Thesman manages what few other authors can: to make magic tedious. The conclusion is obvious nearly from the first page -- all Bridget has to do is accept her powers, but she spends the entire book agonizing over it. Presumably Thesman has a point to make about teen self-acceptance, but her point will be lost with readers who just want to smack Bridget for being so dense.","Parents need to know that this book seems to be focused on teens' desire to be accepted by their peers.

The Egypt Game,Newbery Honor book is a fun mystery romp.,"April is sent to live with her grandmother while her mother tours with a band. Angry, lonely, and determined that her stay will be a short one, April reluctantly makes friends with Melanie, another girl in the apartment building. April soon realizes that she and Melanie have a great deal in common, including an interest in the ancient Egyptians. When horrible and mysterious things start happening, the Egypt gang wonder who or what is causing it and if the events are connected.
","EGYPT GAME is a fun, scary, and exciting story at times; at other times the book is a bit slow. Snyder does a great job getting readers to care about the characters. We want to know if April Hall will ever warm up to her grandma and if Marshall Ross will ever give up his stuffed octopus ""Security."" Will Melanie Ross be able to get the kids at school to understand April's eccentric personality?
Kids will like how Snyder captures the preteen disgust and teasing that accompanies boy/girl relations and how she draws readers into the Egyptian world the gamers create with found objects and their imaginations. Then their world is disrupted by a very adult and tragic event -- the murder of a neighborhood child -- the second in as many years. Of course there are plenty of suspicious characters. And of course the kids are immediately drawn in to the mystery, just as readers will be.","Parents need to know that two children are murdered in this story. The murders aren't described, but the other kids are aware of the events. There is also an attempted child abduction. The information is given and explained in real, yet age-appropriate fashion.

Bear Came Along,"Bear finds he's not alone in fun, eye-opening adventure.","The river at the heart of this story didn't know it was a river until BEAR CAME ALONG. Once Bear falls into the river on a log, he doesn't know he's on an adventure until Froggy jumps on, followed by two Turtles, Beaver, two Raccoons, and Duck. They hurtle toward a waterfall, but the peril turns into a thrilling, fun ride as they rejoice that, sink or swim, they're all ""in it together."" ","This rollicking animal adventure shows how much you can learn about your world -- and how much fun you can have -- when you go with the flow and team up with new friends. The repetition of ""until"" keeps the momentum and suspense going: Bear didn't know he was on an dventure until Froggy jumped on, the Turtles didn't know how to enjoy the ride until Beaver showed up, etc. Duck didn't know there was a world to see until they all plummet over a waterfall to a big, glorious pond below. LeUyen Pham's engaging cartoon-like art underscores the personality and strengths of each animal. And the variation in perspectives -- sometimes from above, sometimes close up, sometimes far away, sometimes in strips like a comic -- keeps readers glued to the action. Author Richard T. Morris' concluding lines are: ""So many different animals living their separate lives, but they didn't know they were in it together ... until ... the river came along."" In an author's note at the back, he writes, ""Sometimes the hardest thing to do is to embrace the other, especially when that other is so different. But it is through this connection that we truly discover our best selves -- our strengths, our weaknesses, our fears, our courage. This story says, 'Take a chance!' 'Hop on board!' 'Work together!' 'Trust each other! 'Share the adventure!'""","Parents need to know that Richard T. Morris' Bear Came Along, illustrated by LeUyen Pham, won a 2020 Caledecott Honor. It follows what happens when Bear falls into the river on a log, then other animals he doesn't know jump on, one by one, as they hurtle toward a waterfall. The underlying sweet message is that we all share this earth and ""we're all in this together,"" and that teaming up with those who are different from you can remind you that the things that bind us are greater than the things that divide us. There's peril when they approach and plummet over the waterfall, but it's treated with humor and nobody gets hurt. Instead, they enjoy the wild ride.

The Wells Bequest,"Absorbing, fast-paced sci-fi fantasy hinges on time machine.","Leo's startled when a tiny machine whirs into his bedroom and inside it he sees a six-inch version of himself seated with a beautiful miniature girl both dressed in old-fashioned clothes. After it departs, Leo's search for this extraordinary machine takes him to the New York City Circulating Material Repository, where he meets Jaya and recognizes her as the very girl he saw in his room. His quest for the extraordinary machine and the two kids' attempts to make it work ultimately take them time traveling to London in the 1890s. There they hunt for the prototype and seek to warn a scientist of imminent danger to his work. Although they find the intricate plans, Simon, from the British Repository in London, demands the machine. He threatens them with death and destruction if they don't relinquish it and all its secrets. Can Leo and Jaya prevent a catastrophe?
 ","Despite some odd people and even stranger events, THE WELLS BEQUEST is written with enough authenticity to seem thoroughly believable. This fast-paced sci-fi fantasy is filled with adventure, humor, a hint of romance, and enough tension to keep you turning page after page. Leo and Jaya are likeable. While they are both shrinking and growing physically in pursuit of their goal, it's Leo who matures and earns respect from Jaya, his supervisor, and his family.  Most important, he learns to respect himself. ","Parents need to know that The Wells Bequest is a companion to The Grimm Legacy and also features the New York City Circulating Material Repository, but it's not necessary to have read that book first. This volume has many mathematical calculations, several scientific references, and in-depth speculation and exploration surrounding H.G.

"The Amazing Adventures of John Smith, Jr., aka Houdini","Relatable, realistic story of a teen boy in a rough 'hood.","Thirteen-year-old John Smith Jr. -- aka Houdini -- is writing a novel based on his family and friends in a rough-around-the-edges neighborhood in Providence, RI, hoping it might pave the way to riches. As he writes, he finds himself learning more than he expected about himself, his family, and his friends and neighbors. Houdini starts a leaf-raking enterprise with his friends, gets to know an intimidating neighbor, tries to deal with a bully, and copes with his father's unemployment and his brother's service in Iraq. His revered brother, Franklin, is reported missing, then turns up safe but wounded. When he comes home, he's different from the brother Houdini knew. Houdini realizes, however, that his brother isn't the only one who's changed.
","There's a lot to like in this yarn: an engaging hero, a colorful setting peopled with relatable characters, a grounded realism. Author Peter Johnson aims squarely at boys, who probably will nod in agreement with his depiction of a teen boy's world. The publisher recommends it for ages 8 and up, but quite a bit of the content -- references to drugs and alcohol, some sexual innuendo, rude language -- push the reading level higher for most kids.
The narrator, firmly in the fold of a loving, solid family, acts as a safe bridge into a tough environment. He's a great kid, doing the best he can given the circumstances. The supporting characters stretch reality, including a golden-boy older brother and a cartoonishly sleazy politician. Unfortunately, the story putters to a stop after the requisite acknowledgment of Houdini's personal growth: It's a bit of letdown after getting caught up in this boy's life.","Parents need to know that Houdini lives in a scrappy part of town: Families here tend to be dysfunctional to outright abusive, and all are struggling to make ends meet. It's a realistic depiction of a certain type neighborhood, but it might a little too real-world for young readers. There's an undercurrent of violence -- abusive parents, neighborhood bullies, and the war in Iraq -- along with sexual innuendo and references to drugs and drinking.

"A Court of Thorns and Roses, Book 1","Dark magic, gore, hot faerie romance mark mature fantasy.","In a vaguely ancient-Celtic world (whose map, at the beginning of the book, strongly resembles the British Isles) where the faeries regularly war with one another, engage in back-stabbing intrigue, and massacre hapless victims of all species, humans struggle to survive on the tiny bit of territory the faeries have left them. Nineteen-year-old Feyre, the youngest child in a merchant family that's lost all its money, keeps her father and sisters alive by hunting in the woods, but one day in the dead of winter, when they're all about to starve, she kills a huge wolf. Before long, a huge, ferocious beast comes from the faery world to take revenge nd drags Feyre off to his kingdom. Once there, her shape-shifting captor drops his disguise (though he retains claws throughout), revealing himself as Tamlin, a High Fae and, it turns out, a perfect host, despite the mask that never leaves his face. Surrounded by beauty and kindness in A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES, Feyre soon begins to fall in love with Tamlin -- and to learn more about the terrible curse that hangs over him and his people.
","Both bodices and bodies are ripped to shreds early and often in this sexy, violent, magic-steeped page-turner. Narrator/protagonist Feyre may sometime bog things down in internal hand-wringing, and an occasional anachronistic howler creeps into the dialogue. But, as the dark, romantic, Beauty and the Beast-based saga unfolds, bestselling author Sarah J. Maas reveals complex characters, puts them in impossible situations, and sets up plenty of developments in future volumes.
Along the way, there's a lot of sexual tension and release, with plenty of overheated description, such as: ""His bite lightened, and his tongue caressed the place his teeth had been. He didn't move -- he just remained in that spot, kissing my neck. Intently, territorially, lazily. Heat pounded between my legs, and as he ground his body against me, against every aching spot, a moan slipped past my lips.""","Parents need to know that A Court of Thorns and Roses is the first volume of a romantic fantasy trilogy by bestselling Throne of Glass author Sarah J. Maas. It's an imaginative, violent retelling of Beauty and the Beast, with gory battles, gruesome injuries, and violent death, plus lots of romantic longing, raging passion, and sex-drenched menace. Several characters, including protagonist Feyre and the cursed faerie lord Tamlin, show great courage and selflessness in trying to protect innocent lives and face impossible ethical dilemmas, including sending their loved ones to their doom. They don't always choose well, but they try to make things right as best they can. Recurring strong language includes ""s--t,"" ""damn,"" and ""hell.""

"The Opal Deception: Artemis Fowl, Book 4","Fun, fast-paced volume shows the kid genius' nicer side.","At the end of the last Artemis Fowl book, The Eternity Code, young criminal genius Artemis and Butler had their memories wiped so that they would no longer remember what they knew about the Lower Elements -- fairies, goblins, centaurs, etc. But of course Artemis had devised a clever plan to get his memory back. As it turns out, though, his plan doesn't work fast enough. Meanwhile, his old adversary/friend Holly Short needs his help -- Opal Koboi has escaped and is planning both revenge and world domination, and only Artemis is clever enough to oppose her. But Opal, who's s smart as Artemis, quickly gets the upper hand, and has Artemis and Holly playing defense as her plans fall into place one by one -- plans that include humiliating and discrediting Holly before she's killed. Now they are on the run both from Opal, and from the LEP, whom Opal has fooled into thinking that Holly has gone renegade.
","Fans of the series who were horrified to think it would end as a trilogy will be thrilled to see this new episode. While it can be read without reading the previous books, that's not recommended. Even with lots of exposition, it's pretty confusing without the context. But it maintains the strengths of the series: fast pacing, suspense, smarty-pants humor, B-movie dialogue and plotting, and unusual settings.
Artemis is considerably softened up here, a process begun in the previous book and now accelerated. At times he is almost, well, nice -- which may disappoint some readers even as parents breathe a sigh of relief.","Parents need to know that Eoin Colfer's The Opal Deception is the fourth book in the popular Artemis Fowl series. Here Artemis' and adversary/friend Holly Short needs his help, as Opal Koboi has escaped and is planning both revenge and world domination.

Hug Machine,Sweetly funny hugger's tale is irresistible read-aloud.,"The wide-eyed, long-armed little boy who calls himself the Hug Machine is on a mission: to hug anything -- and everything! -- in his path. Everyone needs a hug, he figures, and he's just the boy to help them out. If it's spiky, he'll don protective gear. If it's humongous, he'll grab a ladder. If it's an inanimate object, like a park bench or a mailbox, he'll still share some love. Pizza keeps him going, but a long day of hugging tires him out. A loving pair of arms scoops him up and holds him close, because sometimes a hug is just what you need.
","HUG MACHINE begins with the bold claim that the bug-eyed, floppy-armed, red-booted young boy is the best at hugging -- and it's easy to believe. In his first solo book for children, Scott Campbell beautifully blends humor and heart. He creates a winning young hero, earnestly striving to make the world a better place, one hug at a time. Campbell's watercolor illustrations, with a softened palette, enhance the comforting tone. The little boy is utterly charming: Persistent and sure of his purpose, he sees hugging as his duty, a talent he must share. Kids will delight in the startled reactions to the boy's hugs and will love following him on his hugging spree through town (and parents will love the hugs that undoubtedly will follow this read-aloud).
 ","Parents need to know that Hug Machine, by Scott Campbell, is a perfect book for snuggly story time. This is the instruction manual for hugging you didn't know you needed: Even experienced huggers will pick up some tips from the young hero of the tale. He wraps his long arms around his target, closes his eyes, and relaxes into a deep hug, absolutely focused on whomever -- or whatever -- he's hugging.

Three Little Words: A Memoir,Harrowing foster child memoir for mature readers.,"In the first half, author Ashley Rhodes-Courter describes her childhood in the foster-care system: After being taken away from her mother at age three, she endures fourteen foster homes in nine years, including one that was seriously abusive. In the second half she details her adoption and subsequent struggles to adapt, overcome her distrust, and feel like she belongs with her new family, as well as her legal battles with the abusive foster parents and the state system that looked the other way.
","The first half of this book is just disturbing and horrifying, the more so because readers know that it's true, and actually happened to the little girl in the pictures at the back. It's for teens only, and even they might wonder why they are reading something so miserable. But as a story, that first half perfectly sets up Rhodes-Courter's courageous battles and triumphant successes in the second half, leaving the readers feeling strongly connected to the author and deeply satisfied by her accomplishments.
The author spares no one, least of all herself, and in her plain, straightforward, unadorned prose her anger is palpable and fully justified. But her determination and strength of character prevent her from wallowing in blame and indignation, instead turning this into a story of hope and triumph as she rises from the ashes of her ruined childhood to become a best-selling author and spokesperson for the protection of foster and adopted children. If you can get through the harrowing first half, you will find yourself astonished and uplifted.","Parents need to know that this is a true story filled with real-life horrors. While nothing is described graphically, it includes a variety of forms of child abuse and mistreatment; lots of sexual references, none of them healthy; swearing; drugs; alcohol; and acting out of psychological damage.

As terrific as the prequel--though readers may miss the schoolmarmish goldfish and the blue-haired Things.
 ","The Cat in the Hat's always walking (or skiing) uninvited into people's homes, creating messes so far over the top, they're scary -- nd the havoc he wreaks in this book is no exception. On top of that, the Cat's cohorts are even more out of control than he is! Despite all his quirks, though, readers like the Cat.

After some tough criminal types show up at the tattoo shop looking for Galen, the two couples decide to escape for the weekend to an isolated lakeside cabin owned by Mia's parents. The first night, they play a party game called Three Truths and a Lie, which reveals one of them may have committed a murder several years before. After that, things begin to go terribly wrong. Their satellite phone disappears, there's a mysterious fire, their car is disabled -- nd they're being stalked by a killer.  ","Two teenage couples, a long-buried secret, lots of sexual tension, a creepy cabin in the woods, and a killer on the loose make for a chilling page-turner. Brent Hartinger's novels featuring gay and bisexual teens are both popular and well-reviewed, so his handling of the relationship between Liam and Rob and the pair's conflicts with Galen is both sensitive and insightful.
Teens who are regular viewers of shows such as Game of Thrones or fans of writers such as Stephen King may find the novel's ""scare"" quotient a bit low, but it will suit readers who want a thriller that isn't nightmare-inducing and lacks large quantities of gore. A clever twist should surprise most readers.

Soon after their arrival, strange things begin to happen, and it becomes apparent that someone is stalking them with murderous intentions. Sexual tension between the couples is constantly in the background, both couples have sex during the weekend, and the sex between Liam and Rob is somewhat graphically described. Strong language (""a--hole,"" ""f--k,"" ""bitch"") is used casually in conversation. Violence is graphic (there's a vicious attack, a poisoning, and a strangulation -- one of which may not be what it seems), but it's not as intense or explicit as the violence in many popular books or on cable TV shows.

Along with Paul's caring parents, this odd assortment of people help Paul reach his goal of climbing to the moon. And then he learns that he's not alone up there...
","THE BOY WHO CLIMBED INTO THE MOON is a fast-paced, zany, and nonsensical fable of a boy who dreamed a dream. Young readers and literal thinkers may have trouble rolling with the arbitrary plot and dialogue, but those who can tolerate and enjoy unrealistic adventures will find this story delightful. The language is playful, the characters warm, and the goal outrageous.
And while the book is unreal, its messages aren't: Readers will see that imagination is necesary, taking risks is good, community is stronger than isolation, war is absurd, anything is possible, love makes things possible, creativity helps you reach your goal, tolerance is essential, and acceptance changes lives. Ultimately this is a  whimsical, peculiar book with heart.","Parents need to know that this is a fantastical story, with very little logic and much magic realism. Readers wiling to suspend their belief in reality in order to enjoy the wacky tale will find worthwhile messages about imagination, possibilities, teamwork, creativity, curiosity, and more. Characters are kind and supportive, though many of them waver between sanity and insanity. One character is a war veteran, and, as such, he is depressed, gets the jitters, and sweats (though ""when his brain can be unscrambled, he has good ideas"").

The Secret Order of the Gumm Street Girls,Fun page-turner weaves in some ruby slipper magic.,"Three very different 11-year-old girls live on Gumm Street: Franny thrives on adventure, Cat is athletic with ESP, and Pru is safety conscious and loves to have her nose in a book. Around the time that a fourth girl, Ivy, moves to Gumm Street, strange things start to happen. The piano teacher and friend of the girls, Mr. Staccato, floats away into the sky, a slipper from The Wizard of Oz disappears, and a woman named Cha-Cha Staccato arrives bearing an uncanny resemblance to a certain wicked witch.
The girls must overcome their differences and work as a team to get to the bottom of these mysterious happenings, save themselves from being squeezed into a potion, and even save their beloved town of Sherbet.
","Filled with adventure, mystery, teamwork, fantasy, humor, and wonderful illustrations, this is a page-turner that will delight tween readers. Sending a good message for this often-cliquey age, the 11-year-old girls living on Gumm Street are very different and don't like one another in the beginning. But each has unique skills that makes her a good member of this sleuthing team.
The fantasy elements and even the character names are quirky and fun. Positive messages of beauty are woven in when two over-the-top characters who want the perfect eternal-youth-and-beauty potion have their plans foiled by the girls, who have a much more grounded idea of beauty.","Parents need to know that this is story is loosely tied to characters from The Wizard of Oz, and some parts are similarly scary: A certain wicked witch threatens the girls, who are banished to a strange land and have to dodge a fire. Also, a father vanishes, and his daughter is jinxed. But these scary sequences also have humor. There are many references to body image, but it's the older women who are obsessed with their looks -- the girls have the right perspective.

\ Even after she wins the boy of her dreams, her life is in turmoil as she tries to decide if she should stay true to her abstinence pledge.
","This book has a cute premise: Mary Jane has two voices in her head: a good girl and a, well, not-so-good girl. These voices advise her about her relationship with Jackson, the boy she's fallen for, who is also dating Star, the popular, mean girl at school. The problem is, like the voices, the book is split in two with Mary Jane dealing with rumors Star is spreading about her and trying to decide whether to have sex with Jackson.
There is a good message here about learning to listen to yourself. And there's definitely a bunch of topics that parents will be able to discuss with younger teens. But in the end, readers won't be too interested in Mary Jane's voices, or her love story.","Parents need to know that the book's premise deals with sex, from sexual rumors that the school's queen bee spreads about Mary Jane to Mary Jane's struggle to decide if she should have sex with her boyfriend.

The two young women somehow wind up in New York City, and they need to reach a magical spring in Greece before an unbreakable deadline, despite the dangers in their way.

","Female superheroes used to get short shrift, but this portrait of an iconic fighter demonstrates that young women can be courageous, resourceful, and undaunted. Original author Leigh Bardugo and adapter Louise Simonson devise a plot for Wonder Woman: Warbringer that's engrossing, unusual, and well choreographed. The supporting cast is interesting and suitably diverse. The narrative's level of suspense remains high throughout.

What If...,Joyous celebration of a kid’s boundless creativity.,"In WHAT IF…, a brown-skinned girl with purple hair draws with a pencil, and wonders what she'd do ""if that pencil one day disappeared?"" On each succeeding page, she uses a new medium to create art and stories. She folds the paper to make origami birds and stars. And ""if the paper was no longer there? I'd chisel the table and then carve the chair."" She then says she'd peel paint from the wall, chisel the floor boards, sketch in the dirt, shape the leaves, and sculpt the snow and sand. ""As long as I live, I will always create.""
","This book celebrating creativity is itself wildly inventive and creative. Author Samantha Berger's rhyming text in What If… carries the reader through as if on a wave, and Mike Curato's colorful art, brimming with materials used in wildly inventive ways, serves to underscore the message that creativity is imaginative and resourceful. When the girl declares, ""I could still shape the leaves,"" Curato creates a gorgeous sculptural collage of a fire-breathing dragon using leaves of various hues. By the time all the materials have been removed, a fold-out page says, ""If I had nothing, but still had my mind…"" then opens up to show the girl riding a winged, pink unicorn, concluding, ""There’d always be stories to seek and to find."" On the last page, the girl proclaims, ""As long as I live, I will always create,"" and the illustration pulls back to show a shiver-inducing long shot of the girl drawing in her window, while neighbors in other lit windows are also creating -- playing violin, decorating a cake, dancing, and painting.","Parents need to know that What If… by Samantha Berger (Crankenstein), illustrated by Mike Curato (Little Elliot, Big City; All the Way to Havana), has a simple rhyming text with a first-person narration by a girl wondering what she'd do if she didn't have her pencil to create art and stories. The question sends her on an exuberant creative adventure, in which she imagines creating art using whatever materials are available, and the mixed media illustration reflects this inventive spirit. The girl's African American, she lives in an urban apartment building with neighbors who also create, and the whole project feels gloriously life affirming.

The Marvels,"Epic saga of theater family, told mostly in pictures.","In 1766, young Billy Marvel and his dog, Tar, are the sole survivors of a shipwreck that claimed the life of Billy's brother Marcus, among its many victims. Rescued by an English ship, Billy and Tar find a home at a London theater, launching a famous acting dynasty, THE MARVELS, whose tale unfolds in nearly 400 pages of Selznick's skilled, meticulous, poignant drawings, leaving the page-turning reader in shocked suspense. As the prose narrative begins, it's 1990 in London, where 13-year-old Joseph Jervis just ran away from boarding school and is working up the nerve to ring the doorbell of his uncle Albert, whom he's never met. He'll soon encounter the legacy of the Marvels nd try to discover what it has to do with him and his family.
","Brian Selznick delivers another stunner in the intertwined sagas -- told mostly in pictures -- of a shipwrecked boy in 1766, the theatrical dynasty he founded, and a teen runaway in 1990. Keep the box of tissues handy, as there's plenty of loss and many heartstring-tugging moments along the way, as well as lots of love, humor, and miracles in the strangest of places. It's a lush, complex tapestry of stories that rewards many visits. It also explores many deep subjects (death, loss, families, relationships, truth and fiction -- and which is which), as well as history that may be news to today's young readers, such as the AIDS epidemic. Gay and straight couples, and the joy and grief of their relationships, are essential to the story.","Parents need to know that The Marvels, by Caldecott-winning author Brian Selznick (The Invention of Hugo Cabret), is another stunner told in pictures and words, leaving few heartstrings untugged in its centuries-spanning saga about love, loss, angels, madness, fire, shipwreck, family, storytelling, the AIDS epidemic, and a faithful dog. Gay and straight couples fall in love; some get married and/or raise children, and some are divorced. Learning and study are important to the story, which may inspire young readers to learn more about Shakespeare, Yeats, and Latin in particular. Some vividly drawn scenes of a shipwreck and burning buildings may be too scary for sensitive kids, while other readers may find some parents' abuse, neglect, and misunderstanding of their children upsetting.

The Crucible,Powerful play about Salem witch trials a riveting read.,"In Salem, MA, in 1692, in an atmosphere of rigid Puritanical Christianity, a teen girl named Abigail Williams has an illicit affair with a married man, John Proctor, and engages in other forbidden activities, including dancing. Abigail deflects responsibility for her behavior by accusing others of performing witchcraft, and her friends join in, using the ensuing mass hysteria to punish anyone who may have slighted them. Soon the entire community is ruled by fear as the accusations fly, and innocent citizens are imprisoned and executed.
","Arthur Miller's Tony Award-winning play is profoundly powerful in its message, as a stage play, and as a piece of literature. Though THE CRUCIBLE was meant to be staged, reading the work offers Miller's lengthy, analytical stage directions and explanations of the time period, characters, and context of the events. Reading The Crucible is a thought-provoking and affecting experience, and the story itself is riveting.","Parents need to know that the Tony Award-wining play The Crucible is a powerfully disturbing fictionalized account of the Salem witch trials that took place in Massachusetts in the 17th century. Rigid religious and moral views contribute to a community's mass hysteria when a young girl and her friends accuse innocent people who have slighted them of performing witchcraft. The selfish cruelty of Abigail's behavior, and the willingness of the community's religious leaders to rule with fear and violence, teach valuable lessons but are tragic and painful to witness. The Crucible is generally required reading for middle or high school students, and is often used as a point of departure to discuss the anti-communist McCarthyism of the 1950s. In fact, Arthur Miller's stage directions include his own insights into his characters, and into the similarities between the Salem witch trials and the actions of the U.S. Congress' Committee on Un-American Activities.

The Great Unexpected,"Romantic tale blends fantasy, reality, family mystery.","Sharon Creech's THE GREAT UNEXPECTED is narrated by Naomi, an orphan, about age 12, who lives in a small (fictional) American town called Blackbird Tree with her guardians, Nula and Joe. One day, Naomi encounters the mysterious Finn, a boy who seems to be injured after falling from a tree. Finn stirs romantic and possessive feelings in Naomi and threatens to cause a rift between Naomi and her best friend, Lizzie, who's also an orphan. Meanwhile, across the ocean in Ireland, an elderly lady seems to be hatching all sorts of plans that may or may not involve people in Blackbird Tree. And the stories Nula tells about the love that came between her and her sister sound awfully familiar. As the plot unfolds, Naomi, Lizzie, and Nula learn about their connections to the places and people they came from and make peace with their personal histories.
","The Great Unexpected is a beautiful puzzle of a book that's revealed piece by piece. In charming and simple yet lyrical language, Creech creates parallels between characters who are at once fantastical and essential to show the ways in which people of every generation are similar and connected. Do three generations of women, in two different countries, all really fall in love with the same boy? Maybe, maybe not, but they certainly all feel love -- and the same brokenhearted disappointments.
This is a sweet, romantic novel with a wonderful mystery that's revealed with care and sensitivity. Creech has written a lovely, old-fashioned sort of book about universal feelings and characters.","Parents need to know that The Great Unexpected, by Newbery Award-winning author Sharon Creech, blends fantasy and realistic fiction to tell a mysterious family tale that takes place partly in America, partly in Ireland. Creech uses simple, lyrical language, but the blurring of fantasy and reality and the gradual unfolding of the plot could make this book challenging for readers under 9. The narrator, Naomi, and her best friend, Lizzie, are both orphans, and one girl worries about being ""homeless"" and having to live in a cardboard box, but neither girl is ever in danger of being abandoned.

Sometimes Rain focuses on kids having fun outdoors in all kinds of weather, playing, exploring, observing wildlife, jumping in fall leaves or splashing in water at the beach, sledding down hillsides in the snow. The rhyming poetry is spare -- mainly two lines per page -- so it's easy for young readers to absorb and open-ended enough to give space for a kid's own reflections of what a day in a given season can feel like.

The Arrival,Wordless immigrant story is a visual masterpiece.,"In a country beset with shadows and fear, a man leaves his wife and daughter behind to travel to a new country. Everything there is alien to him, even the language and alphabet. But, with the help of kind strangers and new friends, he's eventually able to find an apartment, make food, and get a job. And, finally, he's ble to send for his wife and daughter.
","THE ARRIVAL has been called a graphic novel, but it bears little resemblance to others of that genre. It's completely wordless, and the pictures are a cross between scrapbook photos and storyboards for a silent movie. Done, incredibly, entirely in pencil nd tinted in sepia tones, it's visually almost entirely metaphorical -- only the people, an array of nationalities and ethnicities, are recognizable. Everything else is designed to engender in the reader the same kind of awe and confusion that an immigrant might feel upon first arriving in a strange new country.
The Arrival is aimed at older children and adults, and kids will need some help from parents if they're to get anything out of it. It assumes a high degree of visual literacy, as well as familiarity with the immigrant experience. Even for older readers, it rewards repeat viewing and careful poring over and pondering of each frame. This brilliant and gorgeous book is in the vanguard of an evolution in literary and artistic forms. With the success of this book and others like it, we are likely to see a blossoming of new shoots and branches on the literary tree. If this is an example of the new directions they will take, long may they grow.","Parents need to know that The Arrival is a wordless graphic novel that tells the story of an immigrant who leaves his troubled country to make a life in a new country.

Miles to Go,"Miley shares her life ""so far.""

In this autobiography, complete with two color-picture sections, Cyrus offers a backstage peek into her TV show, concerts, and family life. With short, conversational asides in the margins (""I know! Who wants normal teen angst?"") and various lists (""7 things I'd like to change about myself""), the book will make Miley seem even more like a friend and role model to Hannah Montana's tween fans.
","Adults may roll their eyes at MILES TO GO's trite attempts at inspiration, but Miley's willingness to expose her insecurities will resonate with her young fans. Despite a narrative that jumps around in time and focus, fans will love the personal details (she skips Elton John's and Madonna's post-Oscar parties to eat pizza with her mom, in pajamas).
Miley touches on how media criticism (of such things as her cuddly relationship with her dad, and, ridiculously, her large ankles) hurts her feelings, but she doesn't mention the Vanity Fair photo controversy. Miles to Go is at its best when Miley's rural Southern roots (""there's nothing more relaxing than to kick back and watch chickens be chickens"") and sense of humor (""when I look back on my life, the only theme that I see starting to emerge is wigs"") show the girl behind the star.","Parents need to know this is the sweet Hannah Montana side of Miley Cyrus, not the controversial one that pops up in sexy photos.

"The Wide Window: A Series of Unfortunate Events, Book 3",The least subtle book thus far in the series.,"Welcome back the luckless Baudelaire brood, three orphans who all too often feel ""the chill of doom fall over their hearts."" Lemony Snicket's highly polished and tragically comic series finds the children once again frustrating the awful Olaf's schemes to steal their fortune, after he has cruelly dealt with their latest ill-qualified caregiver.
","This is the least subtle book thus far in Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events. Rather than let ideas of right and wrong quietly percolate up through his story, as he has in the previous two volumes, he spells them out as though his audience is dimwitted. ""They understood that Aunt Josephine was more concerned with grammatical mistakes than with saving the lives of three children. They understood that she was so wrapped up in her own fears that she had not given a thought to what might have happened to them."" Snicket gets preachy and his readers get a lecture.
Nevertheless, THE WIDE WINDOW has plenty going for it, including some of the most exciting scenes in the series so far. High drama is produced by a small sailboat in the middle of a hurricane, a gratifying example of code-breaking, a heart-stopping attack by a swarm of leeches, and the treacherous plots hatched by Olaf that must be artfully countered one after the other by the children. And there is the pleasingly black humor that is Snicket's earmark, served up by the grave narrator.","Parents need to know that Snicket's ability to pile crisis upon catastrophe upon bum luck without the story collapsing under the weight of its relentless misfortune is brilliant, and a surefire attention-catcher.

Hooray for Diffendoofer Day!,Witty ode to unconventional education.,"Diffendoofer School is an offbeat academy. ""Miss Bobble teaches listening, / Miss Wobble teaches smelling, / Miss Fribble teaches laughing, / And Miss Quibble teaches yelling."" Students are taught how to tell a cactus from a cow, tie knots in noodles, saddle a lizard, and use their melons to the utmost--namely, to think, and think fresh. School principal Mr. Lowe announces the grim news that students must take a standardized test and that if they do poorly, their school ""will be torn down, / And you will have to go to school / In dreary Flobbertown,"" where the school is a totalitarian, conformist institution.
Since Diffendoofers have been encouraged to think, they ace the test and belt out the old school song: ""You're gribbulous, you're grobbulous, / Each day we love you more. / You are the school we treasure / And unceasingly adore."" The afterword includes Seuss's original sketches and a history of the project.
","The verse in this book is energized and melodious but more deliberate in its message and tone than the Seuss's usual subtle storytelling. It should be pointed out that this is not a Dr. Seuss book: It is a Prelutsky/Smith book with material inspired by Dr. Seuss' rough draft and enhanced by a host of Seussian visual touches. Lane Smith and Jack Prelutsky were asked to finish the 14 pages of rough sketches and verse, and the result is this bouncy, jangly, inspirational tip of the hat to eccentricity told in verse and illustrated with skittish delight. For Dr. Seuss fiends, the gold mine here is the afterword, written by the good doctor's editor, Janet Schulman, and the reproduction of Seuss' original pages.
The artwork is filled with creepy characters and dreamy landscapes that readers have come to enjoy from Smith, but it is more self-conscious than Dr. Seuss' satirical strokes. Smith and Seuss' art share the same page, giving off a modest tension, if not sparks.","Parents need to know that Hooray for Diffendoofer Day! is the tale of an unusual school where students are taught classes like laughing and yelling. It celebrates the vivid use of the imagination, suggesting how it can be spawned by unorthodox teaching and used to defeat lockstep obedience.

Miles Morales: Spider-Man,"Exciting, smart, cool version of comic book superhero teen.","In MILES MORALES: SPIDER-MAN, Miles is a half-black/half-Puerto Rican teen on scholarship at an elite prep school. He still has the same issues every other high school kid has -- on top of being a web slinger. He's having trouble at school, and when his powers start to go haywire, he wonders if he really should be a hero at all, or if he should just focus on getting his school life together. When Miles discovers a dangerous plot that threatens what he holds dear, he has a decision to make. Will he continue on as Spidey? What about his scholarship? Is he really just like his criminal uncle?
","Clever, timely, and fun, this fresh Spider-Man story explores the real-life implications of the school-to-prison pipeline and the prison industrial complex in a way that's easy for teens to grasp. The book takes on Miles' complicated life -- school troubles, girl troubles, the secret of being Spider-Man, and the guilt he feels over his uncle's death -- and combines it with a brilliant introduction to issues regarding the prison clause of the 13th Amendment (which abolished slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime), white supremacy, and the issue of being brown in ""white spaces.""

With the help of his nephew, sister, and cousin he tries to get to the bottom of it. Will the makers of Stilton -- who think that Geronimo stole their name -- be satisfied once he solves the case?
","This series will get young and reluctant readers engaged with full-color illustrations nd a large, appealing typeset sprinkled generously with ""big"" or ""fun"" words drawn in special ways. (The word, ""embarrassing,"" for example, is written in huge red letters each time it's used.)

Other unique aspects of THE MYSTERIOUS CHEESE THIEF include highly detailed illustrations of Geronimo's workplace, The Rodent's Gazette, and a map of New Mouse City and Mouse Island itself, reminding the reader of similar detailed worlds captured in the Where's Waldo books and those by Richard Scarry.","Parents need to know that there is a bit of cartoonish violence: characters getting bopped on the head with things like umbrellas, a mouse's tie gets stuck inside a conveyor belt, and a mouse is accidentally locked in a cold factory.

The Talking Eggs: A Folktale From the American South,A lesson in humanity laced with humor and magic.,"Children will be enthralled by the cow that brays like a mule, a magical pot that produces stew from a bone, and eggs that hatch jewels. Along with the humor and magic found in this down-home Creole tale is a lesson in humanity.
 ","There's more to this tale than magic and treasure -- ultimately, it's about a girl who retains her humanity under difficult circumstances. Her reward is more than jewels and earthly goods; she earns the satisfaction of being a good person. Readers will enjoy Blanche's quiet, thoughtful approach to dealing with her mother and sister, and her efforts to keep a straight face at the sight of rabbits dancing the Virginia reel.
Robert D. San Souci captures the reader's attention with simple language that brings the country setting to life: ""They lived on a farm so poor, it looked like the tail end of bad luck."" And Jerry Pinkney's watercolors convey the sharp contrast between Blanche's difficult home life and the hilarious celebration at the old woman's home. The art is most effective in setting the mood of the mysterious backwoods and the old woman's home. The cover illustration, which shows Blanche and the crone on a forest path, gives a hint of this tone -- and those who look carefully will see trees with faces and wide-open mouths.","Parents need to know that detailed illustrations and a suspenseful story make this a surefire read-aloud.

Something Like Fate,Easy read about the difficulties of love and friendship.,"Erin and Lani have been best friends for years, but when Lani meets Erin's new boyfriend, she can't deny that there's a connection. In fact, Lani feels that there's more than a connection. A big believer in fate, Lani thinks that Jason is her soul mate. Lani tries to distance herself from Jason, but it seems impossible. Jason feels the connection, too, and breaks up with Erin in order to date Lani. They keep their relationship a secret while Erin's away at summer camp, but when they finally reveal the truth to her, Erin isn't happy.
","SOMETHING LIKE FATE is a fun, light read for teens. Readers will be drawn in by the compelling premise: Lani truly believes in fate, and she can't ignore her feeling that she and Jason are meant to be together. But she feels just as strongly about her relationship with Erin, and she doesn't want to damage it.

Ghosts I Have Been,Peck combines shivery horror with slapstick humor.,"Blossom Culp used to get her kicks by dressing up as a ghost. When she starts seeing real ghosts, though, Blossom discovers her supernatural powers aren't just fun and games. Richard Peck combines shivery horror with slapstick humor in a thoroughly engrossing story centered on a spunky, unforgettable heroine.
 ","It's a rare book that could include a ghost who hangs herself and then serves tea, but this novel pulls it off; Blossom's unique voice frequently sets this skillful balance. Wryly observant of early 20th-century manners, fiercely independent but secretly eager to belong, Blossom tells her story as she lives her life, with common sense and humor. Neither a knife-throwing ghost nor the sudden fame that follows her Titanic vision fazes Blossom. The episodic plot filled with endearing supporting characters is similar to novels written a hundred years ago. The language is old-fashioned, too (""Whether you be born with the Gift or attain it is often debated""), and is an excellent stepping-stone for kids ready to jump into classic literature.
Just as Beverly Cleary did with Ramona (who appeared in Henry Huggins), Richard Peck makes Blossom Culp, a supporting character in The Ghost Belonged to Me, the heroine of its sequel. It's a wise choice, too; Blossom stole many scenes in the earlier novel, and her funny, matter-of-fact narration enables GHOSTS I HAVE BEEN to include scarier moments without losing its lightheartedness.","Parents need to know that although there are definitely some darker moments here (a scene involving a hanging comes to mind), rest assured that they're presented in a non-threatening, age-appropriate manner.

Anne of Green Gables,"Beloved classic features lovable, imaginative heroine.","When aging siblings Marilla and Mathew Cuthbert of Avonlea, a small town in Canada's maritime province of Prince Edward Island, decide to adopt an orphan boy to help with their farm, they never expect to get talkative 11-year-old redhead Anne Shirley instead. Anne's arrival at Green Gables immediately stirs up the Cuthberts' predictable, even-keeled lives -- and before long, they're so attached to her that they can't bring themselves to send her back to the orphan asylum after all. With her vivid imagination, mile-a-minute chatter, and impulsive, love-starved heart, Anne has an impact on everyone she meets in Avonlea, from busybody Rachel Lynde to \""bosom friend\"" Diana Barry to handsome Gilbert Blythe, the boy who dares to call Anne \""Carrots.\""
","More than a century after she first beguiled readers, Anne Shirley is still one of the most beloved characters in children's literature -- and for good reason. You can't help but be charmed by her mix of chatter, imagination, fierce loyalty, and enthusiasm. Her tendency for the dramatic -- both the dizzying heights of joy and the depths of despair -- makes her relatable and sympathetic, and her ability to see beauty in everything is inspiring.
Montgomery's knack for creating memorable characters and realistic dialogue makes ANNE OF GREEN GABLES extremely readable, though reluctant readers (or younger kids in general) may balk at her many descriptions of Prince Edward Island's natural splendors. Those who are ready for Anne's adventures, though, will find her a delightful companion -- and will be excited to follow her through the book's multiple sequels.","Parents need to know that this classic 1908 children's novel by L.M. Montomgery remains a perennial favorite thanks to its memorable heroine: irrepressible red-headed orphan Anne Shirley. Anne's adventures are full of amusing (and occasionally mildly dangerous) scrapes, but she's quick to learn from her mistakes and usually has only the best of intentions. Although Anne gets her best friend drunk in one episode (it's an honest mistake), there's very little here that's at all iffy for kids -- though younger readers might get a bit bogged down in the many descriptions of Anne's Prince Edward Island, Canada, home. A sad death may hit some kids hard, but the book's messages about the importance of love, friendship, family, and ambition are worth it.

Brightly Burning,Engaging reboot puts Jane Eyre in space.,"BRIGHTLY BURNING tells of orphaned Stella Ainsley, 17, working as an engineer aboard the ancient, failing spaceship Stalwart. Rationing and power outages are a way of life on the Stalwart, but Stella dreams of more. When her application to be a governess aboard the private, luxurious spaceship Rochester is accepted, Stella's finally got her ticket off of the Stalwart for good. But things on the Rochester aren't all that they seem. There are mysterious noises in the night, a medical officer who never shows her face, and off-limits areas of the ship said to be used for ""cold storage."" To say nothing of the moody, brooding captain, Hugo Fairfax. Hugo's not all he seems, either, but he's definitely hiding something. As romance blossoms, mysteries deepen, along with Stella's determination to learn the truth.
","Author Alexa Donne's re-imagining of Jane Eyre in space is engaging, but will be enjoyed best by readers who come to it with an open mind. It's not Jane Eyre, and die-hard fans may be frustrated by the differences between Jane and Stella. It's not hard sci-fi, either, and die-hard fans may find too much romance for their taste. But readers who can leave their expectations behind will enjoy this blend of mystery, romance, and science fiction.
Donne effectively creates a vivid, richly populated world among a fleet of spaceships in orbit around Earth. Readers familiar with Jane Eyre won't find any surprises in the plot, but the setting and colorful characters add some interest to hopefully see them through to the end, when the excitement really starts to build. Teens will easily relate to Stella as she struggles to find her place in strange new surroundings, to learn the truth about Hugo, and to start a new life on her own terms.","Parents need to know that Brightly Burning blends the literary classic Jane Eyre with science fiction. Lots of people and events closely follow the classic, but you don't need to have read it to be able to follow along here. A blossoming romance is one of the main plot points, but sexual content is mild. There are a few kisses, including a couple with tongue (but no detailed descriptions), and feelings of attraction and passion from being physically close. Alcohol is mentioned a lot, mostly in a social drinking context, but one character drinks heavily; Stella drinks to excess once. There's very little violence: one gunshot and a couple of mentions of blood, but no gore or detailed descriptions. There's almost no strong language, but ""bulls--t"" and ""dammit"" are used once each.

Flush,Teens fight polluting casino boat owner in fun mystery.,"Noah and Abbey's father is in jail for sinking a casino boat that he claims has been dumping raw sewage into the waters near their home in the Florida Keys. He has no proof, the owner of the boat denies it, and everyone in town thinks he's a crackpot. Their mother is going to divorce him unless he shapes up and gets his anger and impulsive behavior under control. So it's up to Noah and Abbey to prove that their father was right. But with everyone mad at their father, hired goons guarding the refloated boat, members of local law enforcement paid off by the owner, and the owner's son beating up on Noah, getting that proof looks well-nigh impossible. That is, until Noah comes up with a plan that involves a tattooed barmaid, a stolen motorboat, and 34 bottles of fuchsia food coloring.
","Part mystery, part caper, this environmental novel has action, humor, a bit of suspense, and some interesting characters. Flush is like a Hardy Boys book with potty humor. There are holes in the plot big enough to float a casino boat through, starting with why the owner is so determined to dump his bilges, thereby polluting the beach his own son swims in, instead of pumping them into a sewer tank. It's supposedly because the owner is a cheapskate, but pumping the sewage properly would presumably cost less than his hired goons, not to mention renovating his boat and paying $10,000 in fines. Bad guys are bad guys for no apparent reason, and good guys lie, steal, and vandalize, while their hearts are in the right place.
The resolution is unlikely, and there are some whopping coincidences, but if you try not to think too hard, it rolls along nicely and there's plenty of fun to be had here.","Parents need to know that Flush is an environmental mystery by Carl Hiassen set in the Florida Keys. The ends seem to justify the means as the heroes/good guys, young and old, behave recklessly, often stupidly, and at times illegally -- all for a good cause: stopping a corrupt casino boat owner who's been dumping raw sewage into the waters near their home. There's moderate swearing and a fair amount of potty humor. A boy is beaten by bullies, threatened with a gun, and chased by a hired goon. A girl bites people hard enough to draw blood. Teens and dults drink; a teen smokes a cigar.

I'm Glad I Did,Upbeat tale of teen songwriter has vivid '60s backdrop.,"JJ Green comes from a family of lawyers, and it's a given that she, too, will be a lawyer when she grows up. But her heart's always belonged to music, songwriting in particular. The summer after she graduates from high school, she gets her dream job in the fabled Brill Building, the mecca of pop-music songwriting in 1960s New York. While working as an unpaid intern there, she meets Dulcie Brown, a once-great singer who lost it all to drug addiction and now works as a custodian. Meanwhile, JJ also meets and writes a song with Luke, the handsome young man who works a few floors down. JJ cuts a demo of the song, with Dulcie singing, nd it could be the start of a comeback for Dulcie. But fate has other plans, and unless JJ can uncover the truth about Dulcie's past and present, their song may never see the light of day.
","In her debut novel, I'M GLAD I DID, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame songwriter Cynthia Weil vividly brings to life a world she knows well: the music business in early '60s New York City. This fascinating look back at a unique time and place serves as the backdrop to a coming-of-age story that will appeal to older teens. Heroine JJ Green is believable and teens will easily relate to her struggles against parental expectations as she forges her own path through life.
Colorful characters enliven JJ's world, nd an intriguing mystery surrounding a fallen singing star holds the reader's interest right through to the end. The writing's not quite as finely crafted as one of her many pop masterpieces and weakens considerably in the sections of Dulcie's memoir, which don't find an authentic voice and read like a high-school essay. But Weil effectively conveys the feeling of an era when America was on the cusp of tremendous social change. Teens ready to make their own futures happen, and fans of mid-century American history, will enjoy connecting to that time when anything was possible.","Parents need to know that I'm Glad I Did by Rock and Roll Hall of Fame songwriter Cynthia Weil (""On Broadway,"" ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'"") is the story of JJ,  16-year-old aspiring songwriter in early 1960s New York City. It will mostly resonate with older teens, as the protagonist tries to forge her own path in life. A major character's past drug addiction is important, and a memoir within the novel directly but briefly narrates her first time snorting cocaine. Negative consequences involving herself, her family, and her career are clearly demonstrated. Lots of adult characters drink alcohol, including one who drinks heavily when his emotions run high. Minor characters smoke frequently. JJ is a strong role model for honesty and integrity, and kids will learn about important historical events of the early '60s.

The White Mountains,"Appealing plot, powerful writing offset slow pace.","A century from now, humans--living in ignorance of their free past--are subjects of an unseen master race. But one boy's chance meeting with a wandering free man sets him on an odyssey in search of liberty. The story's pace and gravity date it, but the message of the value of free will and self-determination is timeless.
 ","This book has a fascinating premise, and though its pace is slow -- especially for today's young readers, who are used to roller-coaster movie action -- the rewards are great. This is an adventure for thoughtful young people.
The growing realization of the young hero, Will Parker, that he cannot help but reject his docile society, will resonate with passionate young readers who question their own world and their place in it. And his journey is a rite of passage much like adolescence itself. He becomes much more self-aware, but he has his doubts, and at one point he is prepared to settle for easy luxury among the nobility, even if it means abandoning his friends and his quest.","Parents need to know that this book's plot is thin but solid, and the writing spare yet powerful.

The Wonderful Things You Will Be,Sweet what-to-be-when-you-grow-up book taps parental hopes.,"THE WONDERFUL THINGS YOU WILL BE begins with an illustration of a mother and daughter holding hands and the line, ""When I look at you, and you look at me, I wonder what wonderful things you will be,"" setting the tone for a meditation on parental love and expectations. The narrator wonders what possibilities lie in store for the child. Will it be in the realms of art, music, or medicine? What kind of person the child will become? Will the goodness seen in the child today continue to flourish?
","This gentle picture book has a sweet message told in soothing rhyme and truly beautiful art that’s at once nostalgic and modern. It's filled with lively artistic details, such as a mouse band that mimics the kids' rock band, a tin-can phone at a slumber party, and colorful hot air balloons floating over a dream landscape. The art, in subdued shades of blue, yellow, and red has a gently surprising relationship with the text. For instance, when the narrator wonders if her child will ""take care of [much smaller] things,”""the complementing art includes a little blond boy with measuring tape wrapped around his shoulders sewing pants for a squirrel.
While the story is mainly a vehicle for parents to express their love and hopes for their children, young readers will also enjoy the pictures of kids dressed up in fun costumes (superheroes, bears, ballerinas) trying out different roles (musician, artist, veterinarian); the recurrence of woodland and wild creatures; and the cute details. Older children should also enjoy wondering what the future holds for them.","Parents need to know that The Wonderful Things You Will Be, by author-illustrator Emily Winfield Martin, is a touching ode to childhood that expresses the hopes parents have for their children.

Along with your dad, it's always in the parking lot waiting to pick you up from school, which is definitely uncool. And your parents are so overprotective they won't even let you go to the upcoming Viviana Vega pop concert that's the talk of the school. This is the life of 13-year-old Estefania Soto, who just wishes Tia Perla would go away. But when their town starts to consider food-truck regulations that might put her Papi and Tia Perla out of business, Stef starts to reconsider.
","Jennifer Torres' tasty, funny, heartwarming tale of a Latina middle-schooler, her loving parents, the family food truck Tia Perla, and their sometimes-surprising adventures is a satisfying treat.

"Twilight of the Elves: The Adventurers Guild, Book 2","Fantasy sequel fueled by action, humor, zombie elves.","In TWILIGHT OF THE ELVES: THE ADVENTURERS GUILD, BOOK 2, zombie elves have attacked the elven city of Llethanyl, so refugee elves flood into Freestone, where they're confined to a makeshift tent city. The queen of the elves, Me'Shala, enlists the young apprentices of the Adventurers Guild for a secret mission to try to save Llethanyl. Their plan? To assassinate the necromancer who's raising up and controlling the army of dead elves. But there are dangers loose in the forest as they travel: undead elves and other monsters. Will the young apprentices be able to fight them off? When the mission is completed, will Zed decide to live with the elves or with humans? Will Zed and Brock mend their broken friendship? And can they control the powerful forces that still threaten them?
","The second book in this fantasy series is slower to spark than the thrilling first book, but it does catch fire, and fans of the wisecracking young adventurers will find their fun. Twilight of the Elves: The Adventurers Guild, Book 2 relies on nonstop action adventure, and quip-filled banter, as did the original -- though oddly, it doesn't hit its stride until about halfway in, when the kids trek out to save the elven city. Before that, the action feels choppier, and like an overlong prelude. Also in the first half, buddies Brock and Zed are estranged, which restricts the banter. Once all the kids team up to unite for the mission, the quips and humor fly, and the story's more fun.
Authors Zack Loran Clark and Nick Eliopulos again use their fictional fantasy world to draw parallels to current events and societal challenges. The elves are refugees, confined to a tent encampment. Some angry citizens consider them aliens, chanting, ""Freestone first!"" Also, prejudices and divisions among the three kinds of elves parallel racial prejudice. And Zed deals with being multiracial, half-elf, half-human. All of which can spur thought and discussion among readers, allowing them to consider hot-button topics at a comfortable fantasy remove.","Parents need to know that Twilight of the Elves, by Zack Loran Clark and Nick Eliopulos, is the second book in their fantasy series, The Adventurers Guild. The chapters alternate between the points of view of two boys who are best friends, but there are plenty of strong, active girl characters, including the bravest young warrior and other females in leadership positions. The apprentice adventurers battle zombie elves and monsters, so there's violence and gore; for instance, severed zombie heads and limbs. Though the book is an action-packed fantasy, it touches on real issues such as refugees, racial divisions, and preservation of minority cultures.

The Fourteenth Goldfish,"Funny, sweet fountain-of-youth fantasy about growing wiser.","Eleven-year-old Ellie feels adrift in her first year of middle school. Her parents are worried about her finding her passion, but she's more concerned about the growing distance between herself and her best friend. Life gets a lot more interesting when Ellie's mother brings home an odd 13-year-old boy who grouses about the lawn, badgers her about the honor roll, and scolds her mom about her outfit. Ellie's startled to realize this boy is her Grandpa Melvin, a scientist who has found a way to reverse aging with help from a rare jellyfish. Ellie realizes she and her grandpa have more in common than she knew, but she's worried his breakthrough might not be as wonderful as Melvin believes it is.
","THE FOURTEENTH GOLDFISH is a sweetly written story about coping with change and growing older, infused with both joy and melancholy. Author Jennifer L. Holm, known for the Babymouse and Squish graphic novel series, gets into some weighty material here: the pain of growing old and letting go, scientific discovery as a double-edged sword, and the relationships between parents and children across the decades. But Holm keeps things light and easy by focusing on the positive: Where one thing ends, after all, something new begins.
Cantankerous Melvin is an especially enjoyable character, lighting up the narrative with comparatively placid Ellie as his foil. Even with a healthy willing suspension of disbelief, the story strains plausibility: An ordinary middle schooler would be mortified to be seen with Melvin, with his odd style of dress or grouchy demeanor. Instead of tween navel-gazing, Holm uses Ellie as analytical observer who often seems the most emotionally mature of the bunch. ","Parents need to know that The Fourteenth Goldfish by Jennifer L. Holm (Babymouse, Squish, Middle School Is Worse Than Meatloaf) is a warm and thoughtful look at science, morality, and the circle of life. It pulls no punches about the so-called golden years, from physical problems to the loss of friends: At one point, Ellie's grandfather says he'd rather be dead than old. The reading level is fine for 8-year-olds, but the themes of change and aging are more likely to resonate with older elementary school students.

Russian Mafiya found Artemis senior in an Arctic shipwreck and are asking for ransom. One thing Artemis II knows for sure is that the Mafiya won't leave him or his father alive even if they deliver the money. He has to think of a plan to free him quickly and on the sly. Meanwhile, underground, (fairy) Captain Holly Short discovers some insidious goblin activity while on stakeout. Goblins are transporting batteries from somewhere aboveground, clearly trading with the Mud Men (people) -- which is most illegal. Holly suspects Artemis is behind it and takes a squad up to the surface to find out what he knows, which is nothing. Even though her bust is a bust, both Artemis and Holly realize they may need each other. Holly needs Artemis' bodyguard, Butler, to take out the human who's working with the goblins. Artemis needs fast passage to the Arctic to save his father, and there's nothing faster than traveling in a fairy ship deep in the Earth.

In The Arctic Incident there's a radioactive train, a charged plasma tube, a nuclear submarine, and lava fissures, plus baddies like goblins, the Russian Mafiya, and a revenge-fueled tech genius after them.
The only minus to this fast-paced storytelling is that it's not always easy to visualize this world. Details on where the People live are spare and mainly focus on the fairy tech. Perhaps that's why the graphic novel versions of the series are also so popular.","Parents need to know that The Arctic Incident is the second book of eight in the Artemis Fowl storyline. This is a review of the text version. A graphic novel version is also available, as well as a movie of the first two books joined together set for release in 2020. As with the first book, Artemis Fowl, there's a whole lot of fantasy action violence here, but major bloodshed is averted in a climactic battle with the help of sophisticated fairy weaponry that knocks enemies unconscious instead of killing them. Still, a few bad guys go down, one from a kind of electric shock, and another falls in lava. Some bad guys betray their own and kill them with guns, once at close range to the back of the head. German shepherds threaten attack, a finger is amputated (and reattached with magic), and an explosion blows a hole through a fairy wing. An injured man is kidnapped after he nearly drowns in a shipwreck; there's mention that his leg had to be amputated. The 13-year-old criminal mastermind, Artemis Fowl, softens up a bit in this one. He has brief moments of humility and respect for those around him, including the fairies he'd made enemies of in the last book. Of special note to parents who don't enjoy potty humor nearly as much as their kids: The gassy dwarf is back and more lethal than ever.

"Malamander:  Legends of Eerie-on-Sea, Book 1","Delightfully spooky fantasy-series start has charm, chills.","It's said that the MALAMANDER has been haunting the tiny town of Eerie-on-Sea for generations. But when orphaned Violet Parma climbs through his window and asks Herbie Lemon to hide her, little does Herbie imagine how dangerously close his new friend will bring him to the terrifying legend. Along the way they'll have to get around the imperious Lady Kracken, the mysterious Sebastian Eels, a glowing crystal egg, Boat Hook Man, and more. And to think it all starts with a code typed out by a mermonkey utomaton.
","This delightfully spooky fantasy series opener for big kids and tweens drips with charm and chills, thanks to sprinklings of magic, humor, and mystery along with a dash of steampunk. Malamander is populated with colorful, quirky characters led by the clever and intrepid duo of 12-year-olds, Herbie and Violet. The plot moves along at a brisk pace with plenty of twists and turns along the way. Author Thomas Taylor's entertaining use of language, especially when it comes to people and place names; his sly sense of humor; and chapters with cliffhanger endings make it a great choice to read aloud. Sprinkled throughout are vivid illustrations that bring the story to life.
Neither Herbie nor Violet has parents, and themes of loss are explored with sensitivity but not too deeply. Other themes include friendship, trust, and the joys and dangers of discovery. The story wraps up nicely while leaving plenty of room for more to come. Kids who can handle a scare or two will enjoy the action, adventure, magic, and mystery along the way.","Parents need to know that Thomas Taylor's Malamander: Legends of Eerie-on-Sea, Book 1 is the first book in  planned fantasy series aimed at middle-grade readers. There's lots of suspense and scariness from heroes in danger from both real-world and fantasy creatures. Blood is mentioned a few times but not described in detail, the villain punches a child in the face, shoots harpoons at a child and a fantasy creature, and throws a cat into a shelf and knocks it out. A few illustrations show scary fantasy creatures, and one shows a man being held by giant tentacles. The story explores themes of loss, of both people and things. Herbie is a foundling so has never had a family, and Violet's parents are missing and presumed dead. Both heroes are good role models, and dark-skinned girls with curly hair will especially enjoy seeing a strong heroine who looks like them. Strong language includes one instance each of ""damned"" and ""hell,"" and some potty talk involving fossilized dinosaur ""turd"" and ""poo.""

Impyrium,"Epic, magical fantasy like a ""Game of Thrones"" for tweens.","At the start of IMPYRIUM, the Faeregine dynasty rules over the empire, but their magic power seems to be waning and the possibility of war is greater than ever. Hazel, the youngest member of the family, wants nothing to do with politics, but the formidable Empress has great plans for her granddaughter. Hob, a young commoner working as a page, proves to be a skilled tutor, helping Hazel with her lessons -- even as he reports on activities at the castle to his spymasters. Both young people are on a collision course with powerful, magical entities who wish to destroy the dynasty and remake Impyrium.
","In the first volume of his new fantasy saga, Author Henry H. Neff hits all the right notes without being too derivative. In the wake of Game of Thrones, many fantasy writers aspire to write mammoth, epic sagas, but few have the depth of talent and breadth of imagination to pull it off. Neff does. Hazel and Hob are compelling main characters, and their interplay is what makes Impyrium special.
Whether Neff will be able to maintain the complex story's intensity across at least two more 600-page volumes remains to be seen, but he's certainly off to a promising start.","Parents need to know that Impyrium is the first volume of a new epic fantasy series by Henry H. Neff, author of The Hound of Rowan. It includes some scenes of violence -- notably a sword fight and a magical duel -- but the descriptions are not particularly graphic. The only strong language is ""bastard"" in the literal sense. There's a vague romantic attraction between the two main characters, Hazel, granddaughter of the Empress, and her tutor, Hob, a commoner.

Daniel's Story,Tale of concentration camp teen suffers from weak narrative.,"A 14-year-old Jewish boy is uprooted from his comfortable life in Frankfurt, Germany, and sent to live in a series of concentration camps. Daniel witnesses countless atrocities, some so horrifying he cannot even describe them to the reader. He joins the underground resistance and is able to preserve a little hope for his people's future. By the end of the book, most of Daniel's family has been murdered, but he has survived and is thankful for what little he has left. His faith in humanity has been badly shaken, but not destroyed. The novel examines the great evil -- as well as the great good -- of which human beings are capable.
","Author Carol Matas's approach is interesting but doesn't do justice to the subject matter. Constant references to photographs are intrusive but necessary, as the book was written to complement a photography exhibit at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. Ironically, this device fails. The narrative is also weak and sketchy, offering no depth to Daniel's character, or anyone else's, and abrupt time-frame shifts may confuse readers.
Matas' gift lies in her ability to accurately portray the senselessness of the Holocaust. She doesn't sugarcoat the details, yet the book never becomes too horrifying for young readers. Matas repeatedly emphasizes that people must have a basic level of respect for each other. Throughout the book, Daniel struggles to maintain the belief that most people are good at heart, and, ultimately, he retains this conviction.","Parents need to know that Daniel's Story is a historical novel about a German Jewish teen boy who's sent to a series of Nazi concentrations camps in World War II. Kids who love historical fiction may enjoy this book, but the narrative doesn't do its subject justice. However, it does have a message of hope, as Daniel holds on to his belief that most people are good at heart.

One,"Beautiful, emotional free-verse novel about conjoined twins.","Tippi and Grace are unusual twins, in that they're conjoined and have survived for 16 years. The two love each other deeply and don’t yearn to be separated, except for when the usual annoyances crop up, such as one wanting to get up when the other is asleep. They know their bodies might not be able to sustain them both forever, but even so, they wouldn't trade their life together for anything. ONE begins with the girls learning they can no longer be homeschooled and will be enrolling in a new school soon. In addition to dealing with their medical condition and possible complications, the girls are faced with learning to navigate a new school, making friends, their dad's drinking, their family's dire financial situation, and other issues. The story is written in free verse and told from Grace's point of view. She relates how their medical condition looms over the family, causing some family members' needs to get lost in the shuffle, which makes the twins feel guilty. Even though they've been joined at the waist all their lives, Grace and Tippi are of different minds. And as the school year goes on, the two must grapple with some crucial, life-altering decisions.
","This lyrical, moving story of conjoined twins is told in free verse and packs a surprising emotional punch. The storytelling style adds to rather than detracts from the plot and character development. Tippi and Grace take on typical teen issues, but these issues are magnified because of their medical condition. Author Sarah Crossan successfully strikes a balance between keeping the story light when needed and not veering too far into pathos and melodrama when the story takes more serious turns. Sometimes the twins' problems are amusing; for example, Tippi likes coffee and Grace doesn't, but she still has to deal with the buzz. Other concerns that are serious enough for regular teens are harder on them, such as dating, making choices about drinking and smoking, and making some important medical decisions.
They also grapple with a fair bit of guilt over their family's money troubles, their parents' problems, and their younger sister often getting ignored. Their feelings about these problems are deep and often heartrending. This could have been a cloying or shock-driven novel, but it's not. Tippi and Grace are wonderfully developed, engaging characters, and none of the other characters is one-dimensional. The free-verse approach lets the story flow and adds detail in a beautiful way, offering up snippets that speak volumes.","Parents need to know that Sarah Crossan's One is an arresting free-verse novel about seven months in the lives of conjoined twins Tippi and Grace. The girls have been homeschooled their whole lives, but a family financial crisis means they need to start attending a high school. The twins are not depicted as freaks or played for shock value. In fact, they're smart, compassionate, interesting characters, facing many troubles other teens do, with the added complication of being conjoined twins. Teens smoke cigarettes and drink on a few occasions and eat hash brownies once. Two characters kiss and cuddle, but that's about it for sex. Profanity is infrequent (includes ""s--t"" and its variations, ""f--k"" and its variations, and ""a--hole""). The free-verse style is accessible and could excite readers about storytelling though poetry.

Wild Awake,"Brilliant, intense tale of teen coping with grief.","Kiri is a passionate musician, who spends most of her time practicing piano in preparation for an upcoming competitive Showcase, and jamming with her bandmate, Lucas, to get ready for a Battle of the Bands competition. While Kiri's parents are away on an extended vacation, she gets a call from someone named Doug, who says he is holding possessions that belonged to Sukey, Kiri's sister, who Kiri believes died in a car accident. Kiri adored her sister and immediately sets off on her bike to retrieve Sukey's effects. Kiri then learns that her parents have kept secret the real story of Sukey's death. The information she receives sends Kiri into a spiral of pain, drugs, and a desperate need for understanding and solace.
","Kiri's sleeplessness, her drug-induced moods and personality shifts, her struggle to make sense of her sister's life and death are all so palpable, it hurts to read about her. But it's worth the heartache to experience the unfolding of this perfectly paced story, and the blossoming tenderness between the troubled couple of Kiri and Skunk. WILD AWAKE is a beautifully constructed and remarkably well-realized first novel.","Parents need to know that Hilary T. Smith's intense and beautiful debut, Wild Awake, depicts a teen girl's descent into despair and mania after learning the circumstances of her older sister's death. The central character faces extreme emotional pain with little support, and acts out in disturbing ways, including manic behavior, and use of pot, alcohol, and pills to mask her grief. Another character suffers from severe paranoia and must be medicated to function safely. Two teens in a loving relationship engage in sexual activity, but there are no graphic descriptions of sex.

Lyle at the Office,Complex ideas mixed with warmth and wit.,"Lyle goes to work with Mr. Primm, and of course charms everyone at the office. But when Mr. Primm's boss, Mr. Bigg, insists on using Lyle in an advertisement, Mr. Primm quits. As always, Waber tackles surprisingly complex ideas with warmth and wit.
 ","Mr. Primm provides here a sterling example of putting family first and standing up for one's beliefs -- quietly and calmly, but also firmly and without hesitation. ""Lyle is a very private crocodile,"" he says, and that's the end of the discussion. Of course some young children may be confused by the issue. Wouldn't it be cool to be on a cereal box or in a commercial? Waber never explains why it's a problem, but adults reading this book with their children can open that discussion themselves.
As the decades have gone by, Waber's art has changed considerably. The first book, The House on East 88th Street, published in 1962, was notable for its bold, black lines and its simplicity, which together conveyed a childlike quality that adults and children alike recognized. Over the years his art has become more refined, colorful, detailed, and sophisticated -- it's still very good, but it's lost that distinctive innocence. Nonetheless, Lyle still delights and entertains, while exemplifying the virtues of friendship, helpfulness, and devotion to family that have been the hallmark of the series.","Parents need to know that fans of the series will enjoy the story and like seeing Mr. Primm's work, but the art has completely lost the bold lines that characterized the earlier books.

"The Cydonian Pyramid: The Klaatu Diskos, Book 2",Complex time-travel follow-up focuses on new character.,"In the second book of the Klaatu Diskos trilogy, the focus shifts away from Tucker Feye, the protagonist of the first volume, to Lah Lia, a pampered girl in the future who's destined to be sacrificed on the Obsidian Pyramid. When the ceremony is interrupted by the appearance of a mysterious boy, Lia takes her chance to escape. She ends up in a different time and must adapt to a new set of societal rules. Meanwhile, Tucker continues to track her from one portal to another.
","THE CYDONIAN PYRAMID avoids many of the problems of second installments by shifting the focus onto a character other than the first volume's protagonist. Lah Lia is very different from Tucker Feye, and her adventures do more than mark time until the third volume arrives. Keeping track of all the timelines and characters may prove difficult for some readers, but there's a strong sense that everything will come together in the final installment -- although the plot is anything but predictable.","Parents need to know that The Cydonian Pyramid mixes science and fantasy with religion. It includes scenes of human sacrifice and battles in which victims have their heads blown off. The language is generally mild, with one or two uses of ""hell"" and ""damn.""

The Meaning of Maggie,Girl comes to terms with dad's illness in relatable tale.,"Maggie's a super achiever, often student of the month and champion of last year's school science fair. But now her super-cool dad is in a wheelchair, has had to leave his job, and her mom has had to go to work. But Maggie doesn't understand why, and no one will explain. When she discovers that her father has multiple sclerosis, she naively resolves to ""fix it."" On her 12th birthday, her dad's rushed to the hospital. As painful as this is, she finally accepts the knowledge that the problem's not going to go away and that she and her family will face it bravely.
","In THE MEANING OF MAGGIE, author Megan Jean Sovern has taken a difficult topic and made it accessible. Told from Maggie's point of view in the guise of a memoir of her past year, the story's filled with warmth, humor, and a loving, caring family. It will engage readers who appreciate a spunky, temperamental protagonist, and will resonate especially those who've experienced a disability within their family and must confront it with courage.","Parents need to know that The Meaning of Maggie is inspired in part by the author's experience living with a father who had multiple sclerosis.

Bad Kitty: Puppy's Big Day,"Puppy stars in funny, sweet book about animal welfare.","Kitty is in a bad mood -- a very bad mood. She causes such a ruckus that Uncle Murray abruptly takes Puppy out of the house until Kitty can calm down. Unprepared to be out with a dog, he gets off to a rough start: An officer scolds him for walking Puppy without a leash, failing to clean up after him, taking him into the wrong area of the park, and not having a license. Uncle Murray fixes everything, but an encounter with another dog leads to mayhem: Uncle Murray hides in a tree and the dogs break loose. They wind up in a shelter with other lost and abandoned dogs. All hope seems lost -- until Uncle Murray arrives to help out these dogs in need.
","PUPPY'S BIG DAY -- as with the other Bad Kitty chapter books -- serves up smart information with a mix of mayhem and giggles. This time the cantankerous Kitty stays home, and Puppy takes center stage with Uncle Murray, whose sloppy, careless appearance belies a sensitive, generous soul. Nick Bruel, who has such fun with drawing Kitty, has his fun here with Petunia, a meaty-faced bulldog with romantic dreams and bows on her ears. Kitty drops in to share ""horrible but true facts about dogs"" in two-page, text-heavy informational spreads that explain some fascinating (if a little gross) science without being dull. ","Parents need to know that Nick Bruel's Puppy's Big Day -- part of the popular Bad Kitty series -- gets into the responsibilities of pet ownership and touches on the troubling issues of animal cruelty and euthanasia of unwanted animals. The overall tone is heartwarming, underscoring the importance of responsible pet ownership and promoting kindness toward animals. Even prickly Kitty warms up to thoughtful consideration. When a police officer shouts repeatedly at Uncle Murray for several infractions, Uncle Murray is respectful and deferential -- and the officer reappears in a much friendlier fashion late in the story.

"Independent Study: The Testing, Book 2",Sci-fi sequel spends too much time in familiar territory.,"INDEPENDENT STUDY picks up where The Testing left off, with Cia about to begin her education at the Commonwealth's prestigious University. Her memories have been wiped away, but she still has her brother's contraband Transit Communicator that contains clues about her predicament. But Cia can't stop the nightmares that plague her. With the assistance of undercover members of the rebel forces, she learns more about what's expected of her and what happens to those students who fail to meet the expectations of their teachers. The question remains: Will her hard-won knowledge be enough to save her life?
","Independent Study falls into the narrative trap that captures many second volumes in a trilogy. The novelty of the first installment has worn off, and the author isn't ready yet to choreograph the rousing conclusion. So Book 2 sometimes feels as if the plot is merely marking time. With Cia having had her memory wiped at the end of The Testing, there's a lot of catch-up that simply isn't as interesting the second time around. Author Joelle Charbonneau lso allows Cia to find out too much crucial information by wandering around in the dark and conveniently overhearing conversations. There are a couple of intriguing reversals at the end of Independent Study that hint at a satisfying finale to come, but readers are going to need a lot of patience before they get to them.","Parents need to know that Independent Study is a dystopian science-fiction adventure in the mold of The Hunger Games. It continues the story begun in The Testing, in which high-achieving students are pitted against one another in an exam that has life-or-death consequences. The violence is less intense in this installment and mostly concentrated at the book's climax. The language is tame, with only a few instances of ""hell"" and ""damn.""

The Warden's Daughter,"Heartbreaking story of motherless girl's grief, healing.","THE WARDEN'S DAUGHTER, Cammie, is being raised by her father in living quarters at the prison he oversees, with an inmate named Eloda as her latest caretaker. She's haunted by the death of her mother, who was struck and killed by a truck after shoving Cammie out of harm's way. Cammie feels motherless and adrift with bitter grief: She tries to provoke Eloda with increasingly outrageous behavior, she needily basks in the attention of female inmates (particularly Boo Boo, a shoplifter who smothers Cammie with affection), and she fights with her best friend, who's intent on boosting her own popularity. When a sudden, shocking loss knocks her into a deep depression, it takes an act of great empathy for Cammie to realize she isn't so alone.
","Newbery medalist Jerry Spinelli's story about a girl imprisoned by her own grief and anger is an achingly realistic story about confronting our demons, despite its contrived, too-easy ending. The Warden's Daughter is at its best as it follows Cammie furiously pedaling through the streets or holed up in the prison, nursing her wounded heart. The backward-looking narrative assures us that bad times do indeed pass. Spinelli dials up the sense of perspective with a strong historical setting: an era when the TV show American Bandstand is all the rage, girls don't play ball, and white kids steer clear of the black part of town.
Spinelli (Stargirl, Eggs) takes problematic shortcuts to clean up after Cammie's ""bad time"" -- post-epiphany, she swiftly goes from angry outcast to well-liked classmate, and the absence of nurturing adults is portrayed as deliberate and helpful. Another misstep is the stereotyping of Boo Boo, a joyful, obese black inmate who showers attention on Cammie.","Parents need to know that The Warden's Daughter, by Newbery Medal-winning author Jerry Spinelli (Maniac Magee), is a sharp, beautifully written portrayal of a tween's grief, anger, and eventual healing. The book is written in Cammie's voice as a grandmother looking back on her tumultuous 13th summer in 1959. Many tweens will relate to Cammie's sense of isolation, though probably not her circumstances. There's a strong sense of community in the prison where Cammie lives, but the adults who should be closest to her seem emotionally unavailable. Spinelli shares some wisdom on struggling through intensely difficult emotions, but the justification for why the adults in Cammie's life don't give her the nurturing she needs undercuts his message. Cammie gets involved in some physical altercations, but most of the violence is told secondhand: Her mother died saving her from an oncoming truck, a man who killed a teen faces execution, and an important character commits suicide.

So he creates an oasis in the desert, and steals a hatchling to train there.

He establishes a telepathic bond with his dragon, and gets help from Akki, a mysterious bond-girl who seems to come and go as she pleases.

This is one of the rare fantasy/science fiction novels with no real villains and no battle between the forces of good and evil, just the enthralling and exciting story of a boy, a dragon, and an invented world that rings true in every clever aspect, both fantastic and human.

The Game of Silence,White settlers force Indian family to leave land.,"Omakayas's tribe is worried when they hear rumors that, despite treaties, they will be forced to leave their lands to make room for white settlers. They send messengers out in different directions to try to find out what is happening. Meanwhile the rest of the tribe carries on with their daily lives through the fall, winter, and spring, as they wait for the messengers to return.
Omakayas has plenty to deal with: there are the everyday survival tasks of gathering and preparing food and creating shelter and clothing; an upcoming spiritual quest which she dreads; and dealing with her brother Pinch, a prankster who has fallen in with two of the tribal hotheads.
","This second in a planned nine-book series is much like its predecessor: While there is a marginal plot, it's primarily a portrait of Ojibwe life in the mid-19th century. Those looking for an angry and violent meditation on the inhumanity of the European settlers' treatment of the natives won't find it here: There are no mean people or bad guys, beyond the distant and disembodied government that is making them move. The Indians and settlers live side-by-side in peace and friendliness, if not mutual comprehension.
Louise Erdrich writes in a flowing, seamless style, and liberally salts her story with Ojibwe words (explained in a glossary, though most can be inferred from context). An Ojibwe herself, she writes with the confidence and authority of an insider.","Parents need to know that, in the midst of pretty mild content (especially considering that the subject is the forced migration of Native Americans) there is an amputation of a finger.

Guy Stuff: The Body Book for Boys is an engaging book for boys to read solo, and an excellent ice-breaker for parents who'd like to be more comfortable talking about puberty.
Author Dr. Cara Natterson offers empathetic advice on the ups and downs of puberty, reassuring readers who might feel self-conscious about how they compare with their peers. She covers the key issues you'd expect, but she also packs in a wealth of helpful nuggets, like how to get rid of warts, how the color of your pee can show dehydration, how to hide surprise erections. Her passages on masculinity, expressing emotions, and managing moods are valuable inclusions. Charming artwork by Micah Player helps illustrate key ideas and adds a bit of whimsy to the subject matter. Lack of an index -- or more info on how girls develop, too -- are minor flaws in an otherwise stellar guide.","Parents need to know that Guy Stuff: The Body Book for Boys is a forthright guide to puberty and self-care written by pediatrician Cara Natterson. It discusses sexual development, including illustrations of changes during puberty and explanations of erections and nocturnal emissions, but it doesn't discuss sexual activity beyond a brief mention of semen's role in reproduction. The book covers a lot of territory, including good hygiene practices, moods and emotions, sports safety, nutrition, and navigating the ups and downs of puberty.

Just Breathe,"Gentle, quirky hospital tale will appeal to romance fans.","JUST BREATHE is the story of how high-achieving, popular, high-school senior David meets and befriends sophomore Jamie, who isn't even on the social radar at school. David has cystic fibrosis, and a flare-up lands him in the hospital where Jamie volunteers, and where various setbacks keep David hospitalized for many weeks. Jamie's coping with the recent loss of her father, and with depression, which is more than enough for anyone. As David and Jamie's friendship starts to deepen into maybe something more, they expose each other to different ideas and ways of looking at things. But when they break the rules and leave the hospital without permission, they unknowingly put David's life in danger, landing him in the ICU barely clinging to life. If David manages to pull through, can things ever be the same between them?
","Fans of Cammie McGovern will enjoy this gentle romance that does a good job of balancing life-threatening illness and romance without being too sentimental or weepy. This is mostly thanks to the believable and down-to-earth voices of the two main characters, who take turns narrating events and moving the plot and the romance along. It lets us know their inner thoughts while also showing us how the other sees them. It also thoughtfully explores coming-of-age themes like deciding your own future, coping with chronic conditions, mortality, and losing a parent.
The romance itself follows a pretty predictable trajectory in a terminal-illness-type setting that's been explored before. So it's unlikely to appeal to readers who aren't already romance fans. But those who are will enjoy the story and interesting characters that populate it. Themes of parental loss and suicide make it best for teens and up.","Parents need to know that Just Breathe is a gentle romance with a terminal-illness-type backdrop. One character has cystic fibrosis, struggles with an acute episode with extensive hospitalization, and thinks a lot about his shortened life expectancy. The other main character has chronic depression and is trying to learn to live with the condition, which she knows will flare up unpredictably for the rest of her life. It's pretty light on the sexy stuff, with a few mentions of not-very-enjoyable sex in the past involving lots of towels and tissues for clean-up; otherwise there are a few kisses, but nothing's described in detail. Strong language is very rare but includes a few uses of ""f--k"" and its variations. No alcohol or tobacco use except seeing someone drunk in the past and some risky behavior by a younger sister at parties, but no details are given about what happened. A few instances of drugs mentioned in the context of medical treatment. Parental loss to suicide and a past suicide attempt are themes, but there's no gore or detailed descriptions. Other themes explored include carving your own path in life instead of doing what everyone else expects, and opening yourself up to the risk of pain and disappointment in order to experience happiness.

Brett McCarthy: Work in Progress,Moving story of early adolescent changes.,"Brett is a good kid, a good soccer player, and a good friend to Diane. But seemingly in a single night, as a result of a dumb phone prank, all that changes. Brett is suspended, then kicked off the soccer team, and Diane is no longer her friend. How the world sees Brett, and how she sees herself, is changing by the day. The one constant in her life has been her beloved, eccentric grandmother -- but now she seems tired and is having a lot of medical tests.
","One way or another, this is everyone's story. We change, everything changes, in the tunnel of middle school, and how we handle those changes determines who we are when we emerge at the other end. Brett has a precipitating incident, a phone prank, but the changes were coming a long time before then, and would have come no matter what. The pleasure of the story is watching her deal with them, so the novel rises or falls on her character. Fortunately, first-time novelist Maria Padian knows how to sketch a character -- strong, bold, smart-alecky Brett is a delight, and when she stands up for her principles, and for her geeky friends, readers will laugh and cheer.
But there are many other pleasures here as well. The small-town Maine setting is vivid, especially the summer shack on an island off the coast. The secondary characters are wonderful, most notably Brett's grandmother, who likes to build things like potato bazookas out of junk; her reliable slob of a boyfriend, Mr. Beady; and Brett's friend Michael, an appealing geek in the gifted class. Each of them is facing changes of his own, and, in moments both comic and tragic, each rises nobly to the occasion in ways that deepen and enrich them -- and the reader.","Parents need to know that there's little of concern here -- a discussion of medical marijuana and some brands are mentioned.

Zombelina School Days,Silly fun as dancing zombie girl breaks out at school.,"In ZOMBELINA SCHOOL DAYS, the ballet-loving Zombelina is excited to show off her dance moves: ""Today's show-and-tell day, and nobody knows,/ my HIP-HOP's to DIE for! I break like the pros!"" As the day progresses -- with her limbs falling away, eyeball popping out, and nose falling in a book -- she befriends a ghost boy named Morty, teaches her classmates some dance steps, and plans a dance party at her home on Saturday. Reflecting on her human and paranormal pals at the party, she says, ""We're each different but that makes us cool./ Now I'm DYING to see all my friends back at school."" ","This zombified back-to-school book is loads of fun. Zombelina School Days is packed with jokes and puns related to the cute, upbeat zombie girl being undead and having her body parts fall off. There's nothing scary here. It's mainly a story of inclusion as the class and teacher appreciate each student for his or her special talent and Zombelina reaches out to the new student -- a ghost boy -- to make him feel less strange. Award-winning illustrator Molly Idle gives each student in the diverse classroom a distinct look and personality, with lots of funny reaction takes -- even though students and teacher never seem too disturbed by Zombelina's parts bouncing about the classroom.  The funniest moment is when ""things begin falling apart"" during her dance and her top half ends up chasing after her bottom half.  ","Parents need to know that Zombelina School Days is the third picture book in a series by author Kristyn Crow and award-wining illustrator Molly Idle (Flora and the Flamingo). As in Zombelina, which introduced the ballet-loving zombie girl, and the holiday-themed Zombelina Dances the Nutcracker, this back-to-school-themed outing is loaded with clever rhymes and spooky jokes and puns that play with the notion of a body-part-dropping zombie doing regular kid activities. Like when Zombelina ims to answer  question and raises her ""hand in the air ... but it falls on the floor and rolls under the chair."" Or when she literally puts her nose in a book. The cute illustrations are more cheery than scary, and there's a nice message of inclusion as Zombelina draws in a ghostly new student named Morty.

"Seizure: Virals, Book 2",Kids search for pirate treasure in adventurous sequel.,"SEIZURE is the second installment in the Virals trilogy. Tory Brennen and her three best friends share a common trait that's unique to them: DNA that's part wolf! In Virals, the kids accidentally release a contagious virus that infects them all with special superpowers. The kids can tap into their wolf-like instincts at any moment, but sometimes the ""flares"" come without warning. So, when the foursome's parents come close to losing their jobs at Loggerhead Island Research Institute, and moving away, the group has just one thing on their minds: save the Institute to stay together as a pack. The only way the crew can stay together is if they come into a hefty amount of cash to buy the Institute and the property it sits on. Therefore, it's no surprise that when Tory is informed about a hidden treasure left behind by famous female pirate Anne Bonny, she and her comrades get together to solve the mystery!
","SEIZURE is a fun and adventurous sequel that mystery lovers will devour. Author Kathy Reich, does an incredible job combining fact and fiction. She takes the reader on a journey through the Age of Piracy and ancient Irish culture. Kids will learn a lot about Anne Bonny, female pirate, who ran her own ship and was respected as an equal to the men aboard it. They will also be introduced to lessons of law and society during the 1700s.
Reich shows young readers the monotonous process of researching important data to solve mysteries. The characters in Seizure spend a lot of time in the library, visiting museums, and interviewing experts. Some readers will find the brilliant, mystery-solving minds of the main characters implausible, but others will enjoy the ride and look forward to the final installment in the series, Code.  ","Parents need to know that although Seizure is the second installment in the Virals series, and while it has some violence, it's less intense than the first installment.  The main characters discover a dead body, and it's mentioned that two villains have been killed. The adventure in this book is very Indiana Jones-esque, as kids travel through underground waterways and manmade tunnels, fighting booby traps in search of hidden treasure. There are two scenes where kids are attacked by adults with guns, shots are fired, but no one is hurt. But there are moments when the main character is bullied. Also, children steal an artifact from a museum for temporary use. Although they plan to return it, the consequences could be great.

Bob,"Sensitive, suspenseful story of girl's little green friend.","In BOB, when 10-year-old Livy travels to Australia to visit her grandmother for the first time in five years, she's surprised to find a little green zombie in a chicken suit living in her closet. He introduces himself as Bob, and though Livy struggles to remember him, he remembers her vividly and has been waiting for her return. Livy's a bit anxious when her mom leaves her alone at Gran's, but determines to help Bob find out where he came from and how he might return. Little by little, she recalls coming to, sopping wet in the chicken coop, but neither can remember how that might've happened. Side plots about the effect of drought on Gran's rural community, and a friendship Livy rekindles with a local girl round out the story.
","This emotionally resonant book has smart, snappy narration and a strong fantasy element, but also manages to read like a highly suspenseful, page-turning mystery. Bob is written in the first person, with alternating chapters by two narrators, 10-year-old Livy nd Bob, the little green man who's burrowed away in her closet. Both narrators have a breezy, colloquial delivery infused with humor, making them fun to read. For instance, when Livy suggests a bath, Bob resists, saying, ""It's been five years. What's another few days?""
But it's the suspense that keeps readers turning the pages. Livy's not sure she remembers Bob from her visit years ago, but memories seep back slowly. Readers are kept wondering: Who is Bob? Is he real? Can other people see him? Why does Livy sometimes forget about him? When she was little, did he save her or did she save him? Other mysteries pop up, too. Why's Livy afraid to stay at sleepovers? And what happened when she last visited her grandmother? At points, readers may fear that something seriously traumatic happened, but no worries, the challenges Livy has weathered end up being the normal bumps of growing up. The book lso has imaginative illustrations by Nicholas Gannon.","Parents need to know that Bob is co-written by Rebecca Stead and Wendy Mass, a formidable kids' book duo. Stead won the Newbery Medal for her compelling When You Reach Me, and Mass has written numerous novels for the age group, including her bestselling series The Candymakers. Bob is the story of a 10-year-old girl visiting her grandmother in Australia, and features a strange little green creature whom Livy at first struggles to remember from her last visit five years before. There are mysteries afoot, prime among them, who's the little green guy? The story is astute about the fears and challenges kids face growing up, and because it's set in the Australian bush during a severe drought, it also touches on environmental themes.

Soaring Earth: A Companion Memoir to Enchanted Air,Lyrical free-verse memoir set amid turbulent '60s and '70s.,"SOARING EARTH begins in 1966, as Margarita, the daughter of a Cuban Catholic mother and American Jewish father, is a high school student in Los Angeles. Surrounded by blond surfer girls, her dark looks have set her apart from other students. So she dreams of finding bookish friends and of traveling to faraway places, especially back to her beloved Cuba, where she spent vacations and her grandmother still lives. Margarita has always found joy in writing poetry, but when students in her honors creative writing class make cruel comments about her work, she stops writing and vows that if she ever begins again, she will keep her words secret. In 1968, at 17, she begins college at the University of California, Berkeley, working in the kitchen of a co-op dorm to pay for her room.  She studies Hindi and Urdu and swears off boys -- not wanting to take the chance of getting attached to someone who might be sent to Vietnam. She tutors the children of migrant farm workers and skips the many campus anti-war protests, as taking part might mean missing an exam. Soon, the protests and unrest at Berkeley begin to frighten her and she drops out of school. She drifts, living in a commune in Haight-Ashbury (where she's the only sober resident) and then moving to New York City. In New York, working at a switchboard and living in chaotic conditions, Margarita realizes she's traveled too far from the loves of her childhood: poetry and nature. She returns to Los Angeles in 1970, moving in with her parents and enrolling in community college. There, she starts over, studying botany and geology and finishing her education as an agronomy major at a polytechnic university. And, after long years away, she begins to write poetry again.
","This captivating free-verse memoir shows the political and social upheavals of the 1960s and '70s, seen through the eyes of a teen struggling to find her own identity. Soaring Earth is filled with historical references, and readers unfamiliar with Cesar Chavez, Haight-Ashbury, the anti-war protests, or the Altamont Speedway Free Festival may find it a bit difficult to put Engle's experiences in context. But all teens should find something relatable in her journey (struggles fitting in, making unfortunate dating choices, pressure to experiment with drugs).
Both parents and teens should read the Author's Note at the end of the book, where Engle reveals an unexpected reason for writing her memoir. She wants to encourage readers to find their own paths when it comes to college, assuring them that they can find an inspiring education not just at a big name university but also at a community college, like the one she credits with giving her a new life and purpose.
 ","Parents need to know that as Margarita Engle's Soaring Earth: A Companion Memoir to Enchanted Air begins, the young Cuban American Margarita of Enchanted Air is now a high school student in Los Angeles. Written in free verse and set in the late 1960s and early '70s, the memoir unfolds against a backdrop of great social and political unrest. As she begins her freshman year at UC Berkeley, Engle finds herself struggling to fit in. She sympathizes with the university's anti-war protesters but chooses instead to attend class. Having seen the damage drugs had done to a high school friend, she chooses books and poetry over drugs. Dropping out of the university, she drifts to the communes of San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury and then to New York before rediscovering both herself and her love of writing. While these were often violent times, the few incidents of violence are never vividly described. Engle is the United States' Young People's Poet Laureate, and her coming-of-age story may well be an eye-opener for readers who think poets must have led boring and uneventful lives.

The Quiet Book,Cute graphics and simple words prepare kids for bedtime.,"""There are many kinds of quiet,"" the book begins, and provides reasons that are sweet (""First one awake quiet) -- and a bit sassy (""Thinking of a good reason you were drawing on the wall quiet."") Each page has one line of text page, with a tender illustration of that kind of quiet -- and these illustrations are filled with sweet animals. For instance, the ""Tucking in teddy"" page has a drawing of a bunny rabbit standing on a stool in his room, putting his teddy bear to sleep on one of his shelves as an iguana looks on.
","This sweetly illustrated book, filled with bears, birds, bunnies, iguanas, and moose, will literally quiet children down before bedtime. It may take some explaining for very young children to understand what ""kinds of quiet"" means, but once they understand, they will enjoy lingering over each illustration and thinking about what each one means. The illustrations match the gentle theme, harkening back to a simpler, quieter time.
The matte pencil-drawn illustrations of animals, primarily in shades of brown and gray with a bit of color thrown in, match the gentle theme of the book and have an old-fashioned look.","Parents need to know that this is a slow-paced book that will quiet young children and prepare them for bedtime. Kids can explore the idea of ""many kinds of quiet"" -- and also learn the importance of finding peaceful moments to reflect and rest.

I Want to Live,Emotional story shows what kids with cancer face.,"Dawn Rochelle's cancer has been in remission for almost a year. Her hair has grown back and she's struggling to find normalcy as she approaches high school. Things seem positive, but when she returns from camp, she's feeling tired and listless, and wondering why she's not excited about her brother's upcoming wedding. When the doctor informs her and her family that the cancer is no longer in remission, Dawn faces the biggest decision of her life. A bone marrow transplant is her only real chance at survival. Her brother Rob, the most likely donor, is getting married, and the timing will surely upset his wedding plans. Dawn fears she's not capable of making the right decision, but finally determines that she wants to live, whatever it takes. She faces her traumatic hospital experiences are traumatic with courage.
","This is a poignant tale of emotional upheaval,  straightforward story that may inspire compassion and understanding. Dawn is swept into the complications cancer has wrought on her life and confronts issues of peer acceptance and the tendency of even her close family members to treat her differently because of the disease. Her interlude of rebellious acting-out is short-lived, and could have been better drawn. Instead, it's shown as easily resolved and somewhat superficial. By the end of the book, readers should have a clear, if condensed, picture of what kids with cancer face.
While the writing is undeniably pulpy, it attempts to transmit positive, life-affirming values. I WANT TO LIVE may be helpful to those with friends or family members battling a similar situation, but it also be of interest to teens and preteens who simply like a tearjerker.","Parents need to know that I Want to Live is about a teen girl with cancer who's last hope is a bone marrow transplant.

He also finds out he's in the ""loser cabin,"" The Muskrats. The Bobcats, the ""cool cabin,"" have labeled him and the other Muskrats ""Dead Meat"" and take every opportunity to bully them with words or mean pranks. Led by their leader, Doolin, the Bobcats are the worst kind of bullies. Their sole mission at camp is to make life miserable for the Muskrats. Adult characters for the most part are not helpful and portrayed as stupid. Major Sherwood, the camp director, considers the bullying harmless razzing and all part of camp fun. Rafe unites his bunkmates and gains some short-lived relief from the Bobcats. Although Rafe ends up being kicked out of camp (no spoiler here, Rafe tells us himself in the first few pages), he does so to help his friend Norman.
 ","This fourth book, which sees Rafe continuing his daily battles with bullies, is the least interesting of Patterson's Middle School series, with a less cohesive plot and characters. That said, there are some interesting twists. The scary bunkmate Legend turns out to have a kind heart and helps protect the other Muskrats from the bullying Bobcats. Norman, whom Doolin had given the camp nickname ""Booger Eater"" years ago, reveals to Rafe a bit about his unhappy home life and abusive father. For Norman, coming to Camp Wannamorra is a picnic compared with a summer at home.
Norman's love of reading is his key to survival, and he's able to turn Rafe on to the joy of books. Ultimately, even with its weaknesses, the book's middle school humor and engaging illustrations will appeal to many readers.

After all, according to one of the cats, \""There is something that doesn't want you here, and it will do it best to get rid of you.\"" Olive doesn't know whom to trust as she begins to peel off the layers of mystery filling up the old house. And the wrong choices she makes threaten her friends, her family, and her own life. It will take all her strength to fight back against a dark force in a frightening final faceoff.
","The author has all the right pieces here: A sympathetic protagonist, a creepy old house, and clever ideas. Especially intriguing are the portraits that Olive can climb into (and in which other people, including Olive's strange new friend, Morton, have become trapped). The book has scary scenes, such as when Olive almost drowns in a painting of a lake, but the comedic cats add some levity, and savvy readers will know Olive will survive (Her picture is on the other cover of the other series installments, after all). In the end, this is a smart choice for series-loving mid-grade readers who like to shiver beneath their sheets during a creepy bedtime story.

Slaughterhouse-Five,Vonnegut's time-travel classic makes strong anti-war case.,"The narrator of SLAUGHTERHOUSE-FIVE tells readers about the life of World War II veteran Billy Pilgrim. Billy served in the U.S. Army and, as a prisoner of war, was housed in a facility called Slaughterhouse-Five during the bombing of Dresden, Germany. He has experienced intense violence, cruelty, and inhumane conditions. At some point, he becomes ""unstuck in time"" so that his consciousness moves between real time, past events, and his time-and-space travel to the planet Tralfamadore. After the war, Billy is discharged and builds a life in his hometown of Ilium, New York, with his wife, Valencia, two children, and a successful optometry practice. He's hospitalized for a period after a head injury, during which time he becomes friends with Elliot Rosewater (a holdover from Vonnegut's God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater, published in 1965) and develops a penchant for the works of science fiction writer Kilgore Trout (who also appears in Vonnegut's 1973 novel, Breakfast of Champions). Meanwhile, Pilgrim also becomes ""unstuck in time""; he's bducted by aliens and often travels to and from Tralfamadore, and in and out of the present time. Billy frustrates his children, who find him distant and absent-minded. While the narrator feels compelled to record his experiences on the ground in Dresden, Billy feels compelled to tell the people of Earth about his visits to Tralfamadore.
","A cult favorite for decades, this classic novel blends brutal realism with science fiction, and leavens it all with dark humor. Author Kurt Vonnegut artfully keeps the reader guessing about the plausibility of Billy Pilgrim's time-space travel, and keeps a bemused distance from the worst violence, of which there is plenty. Slaughterhouse-Five is an extremely entertaining read, and an important book for teen readers to explore more deeply in a classroom setting. It also has one of the all-time great opening lines in literature as it begins what is surely one of the strangest meditations on war: ""All of this happened, more or less.""","Parents need to know that Kurt Vonnegut's classic science fiction novel Slaughterhouse-Five makes an anti-war statement that is powerful in any generation. For example, Vonnegut's irreverent description of the conditions endured by soldiers, prisoners of war, and the victims of the Dresden bombing said s much about the Vietnam War taking place when the book was published (1969) s it did about the author's real-life experience in Dresden in 1945. Billy Pilgrim, the central character of the novel, believes he's become ""unstuck in time"" and space, so that a mere moment on Earth equals days or weeks of time with aliens from the planet Tralfamadore. On Earth, Billy suffers from what we now recognize as PTSD; he has built a life -- with a wife, children, and career as an optometrist -- that he seems to watch from the outside, and that Vonnegut regards with bemused distance. Billy's consciousness continually changes, moving in and out of his ""real"" life, his time on Tralfamadore, and memories of wartime. Meanwhile, the narrator breaks character often enough for readers to know that his voice is that of Vonnegut, who actually was on the ground during the Dresden bombing. The novel includes all the brutal violence of war nd then some: People and animals are shot and killed, tortured, boiled, and bombed. Corpses are unearthed and burned after the bombing because they're too numerous and difficult to extract where they lay. However, Vonnegut's narrative is also veiled in gallows humor; he always keeps the reader, and the horrors of war, at an arm's length. The book includes rude language and profanity (""s--t,"" ""piss,"" ""f--k,"" etc.), as well as nongraphic sexual content, such as the mention of men being aroused, ejaculating, and viewing pornographic photographs. Characters also drink alcohol and smoke cigarettes in the book, which is at once an inventive masterpiece of science fiction and an uncompromising depiction of the inhumanity of war.

The Sun Also Rises,Hemingway's masterpiece salutes Spain and Lost Generation.,"American Jake Barnes is a damaged World War I veteran and, now, a newspaper reporter living in Paris. He travels to Spain with several friends -- including the woman he loves-- to fish and to witness Pamplona's Festival of San Fermin. Barnes and his friends see the running of the bulls and a couple of bullfights; and bottle after bottle is drained as they restlessly move from bar to cafe to bar to drunken parades on the village square. As the party atmosphere escalates, however, so do tensions between the characters.
","Hemingway's spare writing style is deceptively simple, and it is fascinating to dissect a book like this and to grasp how much the author said with few words. Widely acknowledged to be one of Hemingway's masterpieces, The Sun Also Rises is at once an indictment and an ode to the Lost Generation or writers and artists who came of age in the years just after World War I. It's also a beautiful love letter to European travel and cafe life. Though Hemingway's attitudes toward love and toward drinking are possibly even more controversial now than they were in the 1920s, the world he creates is complex and complete, the beauty and feel of the scenery is palpable, and Hemingway gives readers of any age loads to think about.","Parents need to know that The Sun Also Rises, which was first published in 1926, is one of Nobel Prize-winning author Ernest Hemingway's greatest literary achievements. Hemingway's unique voice -- his economy of language, his manly ideals, his tangible appreciation for the simplicity of warm sands or a cool drink, or a soft bed -- are peerless. Readers may be put off by Hemingway's portrayal of women -- Brett comes off as a heartless tease at best -- but that also makes for some really spirited discussion in English class. It's also important to note that Hemingway's writing is deceptively simple; though pre-teens might be ready to take this book in on some level, most would need guidance to navigate the destructive relationships in this book, the excessive consumption of alcohol, and the issues surrounding Jake's inner turmoil.

The Full Moon at the Napping House,"A rhythmic, snappy charmer of a bedtime book.","It's a full-moon night, and the light shining in the window makes everyone restless. So how are they to sleep? The story is cumulative, adding each character -- the sleepless granny, the playful dog, the fidgety boy -- and the art adds to the action, with the cat leaping at a mouse and the dog bounding after a ball. Finally, a cricket chirping ""a full moon song"" starts a domino effect. It ""soothes the mouse, who calms the cat, who gentles the dog, who snuggles the boy, who hugs the granny, in the dreamy bed.""
","Picture-book veterans Audrey and Don Wood follow up their classic In the Napping House with this charmer of a sequel, perfect for helping fidgety kids wind down at bedtime. The text is smart and savvy; it's rhythmic and cumulative a la The House That Jack Built, which makes for a fun, kid-pleasing, and highly engaging read. The art is antic, nicely complimenting the restless characters in the text, and its moonlit, nighttime palette contributes to the overall soothing feel. On the last page, Granny and grandson are pictured cuddled up reading in the buttery light cast from the window, perhaps mirroring the reader's own bedtime ritual.","Parents need to know that The Full Moon at the Napping House, by Audrey Wood and illustrated by Don Wood, is a sequel to their classic The Napping House. Both are crowd-pleasing, cumulative tales in the style of The House That Jack Built. In this story, because the full moon's shining in the window at bedtime, everyone feels restless. The text is smart and taut, and the art is antic -- until the characters begin, one by one, to snuggle in and calm down. A very satisfying addition to the bedtime canon.

Stella and the Night Sprites Series,Magic glasses let girl see sparkly fairy world in fun tales.,"In the STELLA AND THE NIGHT SPRITES series, Stella needs to get glasses, but she's worried about how they'll look and how she'll feel wearing them. She soon discovers that her glasses are magical: They let her see the night sprites that live among us, and that wreak havoc when we sleep. The night sprites are goodhearted, strong-willed troublemakers, but are a bit selfish. Stella helps them learn to consider how their wants and actions affect others, to make new friends, and to solve problems so that everyone's happy.
","There's a lot to like in these sweet, enjoyable books for anyone fascinated by all things fairy-ish. Magic is everywhere in the Stella and the Night Sprites series, as is some thoughtful commentary on how to treat other people. A lot of problem solving occurs, as young Stella figures out how to help the night sprites learn that their antics -- tying knots in kids' hair and stealing shiny things while they sleep -- are actually hurtful to humans. She's resourceful, and she manages to keep her special glasses a secret while helping her nighttime visitors navigate both the human and magical worlds.","Parents need to know that Sam Hay's Stella and the Night Sprites series is a fun, playful take on the world of fairies, sprites, and all things sparkly. Stella's new glasses allow her to see a world she's only heard about, and she's surprised to discover how impish the night sprites are. Her adventures with the night sprites help her understand her own fears and difficult situations. The night sprites don't think about how their antics affect humans, and Stella helps them learn about her world -- for example, that a paper clip is not an OK substitute for a stolen coin from the tooth fairy -- while she learns about theirs. Stella quickly learns not to assume the night sprites are bad just because they aren't acting the way she thinks humans would.

The Doubt Factory,Eye-opening high-tech thriller endorses activism.,"Seventeen-year-old Alix Baker is focused on finishing her time at a swanky private high school and then heading off for college. But her life is upended by a gang of teen hackers and pranksters who harbor a grudge against her father, the head of a hugely successful public relations firm. They claim that her dad's firm makes millions of dollars by hampering any inquiry into the safety of their clients' food and drug products. Alix must decide whether to stand up for the conscientious parent who loves and provides for her or to brand her father a criminal, based on evidence gathered by teen activists.
","THE DOUBT FACTORY explores an aspect of corporate America that doesn't receive a lot of attention, especially in fiction aimed at young adults. Author Paolo Bacigalupi uses real-life cases of harmful products as a springboard for an unusual thriller about the distortion of public information for monetary gain. Alix's journey from sheltered private school senior to rebellious activist is believable and nuanced. Some readers (or their parents) may object to some of the methods Moses and his band of teen activists take, but many more are likely to be intrigued by the issues raised in this morally complex work of fiction.","Parents need to know that Paolo Bacigalupi's The Doubt Factory is a contemporary thriller about teen hackers battling the public relations companies who hide the misdoings of major corporations.

Amelia Earhart: Young Air Pioneer,Competent but drab Earhart bio.,"The author expands and fictionalizes a series of episodes in Amelia Earhart's childhood, starting at age seven. The stories continue through Earhart's eighth-grade graduation and include building a roller coaster from the top of a shed to the ground, exploring a riverside cave where girls are not allowed to go, and coasting \""belly whopper\"" on a sled down a steep, icy hill. The author notes in an afterword that she specifically hunted for incidents in Earhart's life that demonstrated courage..
The final three chapters include some scenes from her adult life, such as learning to fly and her first solo flight. Three of Earhart's major accomplishments are listed at book's end. The author concludes with the aviator's unsolved disappearance over the Pacific Ocean.
","This is a superior account of the aviator's life. Long before girl power was a concept, Amelia Earhart rode a homemade roller coaster, rescued neighbors from an angry dog, took a wild sled ride, and explored the Kansas countryside. Originally published as Amelia Earhart: Kansas Girl, this newly edited version is the first in a the Young Patriots series. Author Jane Moore Howe extols the wholesome atmosphere of early 1900s life in Atchison, Kansas, where Earhart is an adventurous, lively girl eagerly looking beyond societal barriers, though she is portrayed as obedient (usually!) and empathetic.
Children may ask why Earhart and her sister lived with their grandparents from 1904 to 1910. The author explains that her father's work involves frequent travel, and Mama and Papa visit once at Christmas, but little else is mentioned. Also, poorly drawn pencil sketches undermine the engaging story and are sometimes carelessly inaccurate. ","Parents need to know that interesting incidents in Earhart's childhood are conveyed through competent writing, but the illustrations are drab. Her sense of adventure will attract kids' interest.

Project Middle School: Hope: Book 1,Relatable tale of girl finding her voice at new school.,"In PROJECT MIDDLE SCHOOL: HOPE: BOOK 1, young Hope Roberts is smart, driven, funny, compassionate -- and trying to make it through the start of middle school without her best friend at her side. Hope was accepted to the advanced program at JFK Middle, but her best friend Sam wasn't. Sam has a whole new set of friends, and Hope has to face things alone, figuring out how to deal with the boys in her classes talking over the girls and sidelining them. Hope knows she belongs there academically, but she doesn't see how she'll fit in if she keeps sticking her foot in her mouth. When the robotics competition comes around, she has the chance to save the day, if only she can figure out the right way to ask for help.
","The message here -- about navigating new situations, owning up to mistakes, being true to yourself -- starts out a little heavy handed, but the storytelling evens out as the book progresses. There's a surprising amount packed into Project Middle School: Hope: Book 1: STEM-focused kids of all backgrounds working hard to do well at a new school, old friendships changing nd new ones beginning, robots, and rescue dogs. It's all fast-paced with an eye for the feelings and outlook of young middle schoolers who are overwhelmed by the bigness of a new school and feeling out of sorts themselves. Hope is a bright star to navigate their changing world with humor, honesty, and dog treats.","Parents need to know that Alyssa Milano and Debbie Rigaud’s Project Middle School: Hope: Book 1 deftly covers many of the issues kids face at the start of middle school, and does so while also validating inclusion, ambition, and compassion. There's a lot of anxiety at the start of (and, let's be honest, throughout) these years, and this is a judgment-free look at the ways a group of soon-to-be friends faces the challenge of simultaneously fitting into their school and standing out in their advanced classes. The variety of races, backgrounds, family situations, and academic interests is refreshing, and readers of many backgrounds will see themselves on these pages.

"The Scorpion Rules: Prisoners of Peace, Book 1",Teen hostages fight for survival in intense sci-fi tale.,"Sometime in the future, a global computer intelligence named Talis attempts to prevent another world war by holding hostage the children of various world leaders. If a war breaks out, the future rulers of the participating nations are killed in some mysterious fashion. Greta, a duchess and a crown princess, is sure her turn will come soon. When a new hostage, Elian, arrives at the Precepture and resists the orders of the robots who run the place, his disobedience causes Greta to reassess her predicament and the power wielded by her captors.
","Starting from a clever premise that guarantees growing suspense, this futuristic tale of survival reads like a brainier version of The Hunger Games. THE SCORPION RULES boasts an engaging and formidable protagonist, a sarcastic and seemingly invincible antagonist, and a colorful and well-defined supporting cast. Halfway through, the plot takes a fascinating turn, opening up a host of new possibilities, and the ending will leave readers gasping for more.","Parents need to know that The Scorpion Rules is the first book in the Prisoners of Peace science fiction series, set in a future where the children of government leaders are held as hostages in order to prevent the outbreak of war.

Strong language includes a few uses of ""s--t"" and ""f--k,"" as well as more frequent employment of ""damn,"" ""hell,"" ""bastard,"" ""goddamned,"" and ""dammit."" Sexual content is understated, although it's made clear that some of the Children of Peace slip out at night to have sex.

The Blood Guard,Action-driven fantasy finds focus as it goes.,"""Don't trust anyone."" That's what 13-year-old Ronan's mother says when she drops him at the train station. This, after she dispatches a handful of baddies with lightning-fast martial-arts moves and hastily explains her involvement in a secret society called the Blood Guard. The bad guys have taken Ronan's father and are after him next, so Ronan's mom sends him to meet another member of the Blood Guard while she figures out why. She thinks her son is safe at the station, but that's when Ronan's harrowing journey really starts. The station is swarming with the enemy, and the only person waiting for him on the train is a slovenly pickpocket. Is this guy really his Blood Guard contact? Should Ronan trust him?
","THE BLOOD GUARD sure gets off to a great start. Ronan's mom kicks some butt, drops a bombshell about her secret life, then drops him at a train station crawling with bad guys. Then he's on the run. Then he meets Hawkins, his pickpocket protector, and Greta, a girl with mad skills -- she was trained by her FBI father. Then they're on the run. And still on the run. And getting chased -- same thing. Exciting for a while, sure, but the reader needs to know the point of it all way before the middle of the book. ""They must be the bad guys because they're chasing us and look mean,"" we're told -- but that's not enough to go on.
Revelations about the Blood Guard and the opposing secret society (the Bend Sinister -- fabulous name!) finally come to light, albeit pretty late in the game. Still, with Greta and Ronan's place in the Blood Guard established by the end, the sequel looks promising.","Parents need to know that The Blood Guard is the start of a planned fantasy trilogy. No surprise that with the word ""blood"" in the title, some blood is spilled. A few almost-deaths are violent -- especially a beheading and a truck running someone over -- but the acts aren't shown and the good guys have regenerative powers. One bad guy dies for real from electrocution. Teens are chased, kidnapped, and threatened with hand amputation. A few skirmishes involve swords, guns, and martial arts moves. All other content is pretty mild, with some mentions of PS3 games and a couple shout-outs to the main character's mom being a ""badass."" Teen characters must decide who the good guys and the bad guys are. They always choose the good side and fight for them bravely.

A Really Nice Prom Mess,Strip club on prom night? Worth a parent preview.,"Cameron and his boyfriend are still in the proverbial closet, so they go to prom together with their respective girl dates. The night starts badly -- Cameron's date, Virginia, is drunk and upset her guy is gay -- and deteriorates from there, as Cameron fights with his boyfriend, Shane, and gets stoned with Shane's date, Jane (but only after Virginia's hair catches on fire). Over the course of the evening, he runs away with a Russian drug dealer, enters a gay strip contest, flees from police in a high-speed chase, and befriends a handsome cop. As Cameron notes, \""the arc of my prom night was headed toward the toilet with touchdown likely in the jailhouse crapper.\""
","Teens may enjoy this madcap adventure, though it veers from ridiculous to absurd to preposterous. Cameron's first-person voice mannerisms can grow tedious and his epiphanies fall on the stale side. Readers may doubt Cameron's professed love of Shane when he manages to make out with four other people in one night.
Even as the unlikely coincidences rack up, though, Sloan keeps his main character grounded with heartfelt scenes, such as one where Cameron confronts his lying boyfriend: ""This is not about your lame attempt to make everyone think you're straight. This is about us and the fact you don't love me. Period."" There are a few gay stereotypes, but some empowered moments too: after listening to several people call him a ""fag,"" Cameron finally bursts out that ""using that term to describe us is incredibly offensive.""","Parents need to know that this novel gives a humorous slant to a lot of dangerous behavior by teens, including drinking, buying and smoking pot, eluding police, and visiting strip clubs. When one drunk teen vomits into a fish tank, for example, another character quips, ""At least you won't have to feed the fish for a while."" While the ultimate message is acceptance, the book reinforces questionable stereotypes (for example, when Cameron screams, he says, ""I know I'm gay and a sissy and all that""; several adult men hit on Cameron and one informs him that in terms of sexiness, ""in the gay world, a teenager trumps a twenty-something any day of the year."") Cameron briefly contemplates suicide; this is treated in a superficial way. Cameron and Shane worry about telling their families and friends they're gay, but everyone accepts the news pretty well, with one friend just upset he hadn't known the truth sooner.

"The Diviners, Book 1",Swell start to a spooky but fabulous Prohibition-set series.,"It's 1926 and clever 17-year-old Midwesterner Evie O'Neill has been ""punished"" for her troublemaking antics by being sent to live with her eccentric bachelor Uncle Will in Manhattan. Will runs the Museum of American Folklore, Superstition, and the Occult along with his handsome but quiet assistant Jericho. Although Evie would ""abso-tute-ly"" prefer living it up at ""swell"" speakeasies and movie palaces with her intelligent but plain best friend Mabel, a series of occult-related murders lead her to reveal a secret supernatural gift of hers to help the investigation. But Evie is far from the only young ""diviner"" in the City. Can THE DIVINERS come together to combat the forces of evil before it's too late?
","Libba Bray is one of the most refreshingly unpredictable novelists writing for young adults. She can tackle anything that strikes her fancy, from a send-up of Don Quixote (Going Bovine) to a girl-centered twist on Lord of the Flies (Beauty Queens). Her books, while completely different from one another, each feature her gift for details that are obviously the result of painstaking research. She also has a penchant for creating protagonists, in this case Evie, who are far from the cookie-cutter stereotype of teen girls looking for love or a misfit wallflower with no voice. Evie is loud and chatty, and what she wants, far more than romance (which she's not even bothered with), is adventure, glamour, and kinship.
This is not a book for the faint of heart or for those seeking the easy girl-meets-boy romance. Bray is a sophisticated writer, and her writing demands the reader to pay attention and sometimes cower in fear along with her characters (the multiple points of view include those of the serial killer's victims). There's a ton of slang (""swell"" and ""say"" and ""pal-ski,"" to name just a few) and decade-specific references that may go over many teens' heads, but that's part of the joy of the story. It dares teens to find out if there was such a thing as the Pillar of Fire church commune, the Cotton Club, and Ziegfeld girls (yes, yes, and yes). With a varied and well-drawn cast of characters that range from a Pennsylvania Dutch intellectual to a rakish Russian pickpocket to a handsome Harlem healer, this is a book that requires time to finish (it's more than 600 pages), but it's such a satisfying stand-alone read.","Parents need to know that The Diviners is the first in a series by award-winning author Libba Bray, who has set her dark and pulse-quickening novel in Prohibition-era New York City. There's an occultish serial killer at work, and only those touched with supernatural gifts can rally together to try to find him. His killings are deeply disturbing, gory, and ritualistic. There's occasional strong language (""ass,"" ""bitch""), as well as some more creative insults and historically accurate references to ""Negroes,"" ""coloreds,"" and various immigrant groups. This is the 1920s, so there's a lot of sneaking around to speakeasies and jazz clubs to drink and dance into the night, as well as kiss if the mood strikes. Racism and anti-immigrant fervor is explained, and there's a good deal of discussion about the occult, witchcraft, voodoo, and other dark beliefs. But best of all, the book is packed with historical references to the literature, entertainment, politics, and style of the Roaring Twenties.

"Abarat: The Abarat Trilogy, Book 1",Travelogue of the weird for kid fantasy fans.,"Clive Barker's second book for young adults and the first of a proposed series is Alice in Wonderland for the new millennium. Like Carroll's heroine, Candy Quackenbush finds herself following a strange creature into a stranger world though, this being the 21st century, she is escaping a drunken and abusive father in a town devoted to butchering chickens, rather than just a dull afternoon, and instead of a tea party on land she finds a poker game floating in the sea.
She soon discovers that this land is the Abarat, a chain of 25 islands, each existing in a different unchanging hour of the day (and one mysterious extra island), inhabited by a multiplicity of strange creatures, from John Mischief, who has seven brothers growing out of his horns, to Christopher Carrion, who wears a high translucent collar filled with nightmares swimming in blue fluid.
","The plot is mainly an excuse for an excursion through the fertile, bizarre, and gruesome imagination of author Clive Barker. This first book suggests an author obsessed: In addition to more than 400 pages of text (including a 25-page appendix), Barker has created over 100 vividly colorful illustrations. When the book first came out there was a free poster map of the world, and there is an interactive version on the Web site (www.harperchildren.com/), though why they didn't print the map on the endpapers is a mystery in an otherwise gorgeous and lavishly produced book.
This appeals to children who like to be fascinated, rather than emotionally invested. Though the story lacks the heart tight plotting of the best children's books, children with a taste for the wild and grotesque will by enthralled by this travelogue of the weird.","Parents need to know that those with a taste for the creepy and bizarre this is a romp.

Barnyard Dance!,Lively pace takes readers on an exhilarating ride.,"In the tradition of an old-fashioned hoedown, Boynton's trademark band of animals take to the floor in a rowdy square dance. A cool cow, sporting green shades and wielding a fiddle, calls out the moves as a collection of fleet, four-footed dancers spin, twirl, and promenade the day away. Rambunctious illustrations are rib-tickling kid pleasers.
In a parody of a square dance, barnyard animals execute classic hoedown moves such as bowing to, or swinging with, a partner. In addition to these traditional steps, Boynton's verses highlight each animal's unique movements, calling for the dancers to move like trotting turkeys, prancing horses, skittering mice, and so forth.
","BARNYARD DANCE's lively pace sweeps readers along for an exhilarating ride. Text and illustrations vibrate with an infectious joie de vivre, bringing smiles to readers' faces. The swinging verses tap into toddlers' love of movement and song; preschoolers can have a blast doing their own rendition of the dance. However, even a reader as young as 8 months old enjoyed a read-aloud session, flashing gummy grins and emitting happy coos.
Sandra Boynton's fanciful illustrations delight children; dogs and bunnies frolic together, while a pig whirls about a slightly bewildered-looking sheep. The simply drawn pictures on a pure white background focus the reader's attention on the comical characterizations. Little ones will be reaching for this book time and again. The catchy rhymes and humorous pictures make it easy for parents and caregivers to comply with repeated requests for this story.","Parents need to know that toe-tapping rhythms and playful verses encourage children to get up and move along with the animals; joyous illustrations celebrate dancing.

"The SheepOver: Sweet Pea & Friends, Book 1",Sweet story about sick lamb is confusing in parts.,"In THE SHEEPOVER: SWEET PEA & FRIENDS, farm dog Laddie wakes up Farmer John to let him know that orphan lamb Sweet Pea has fallen sick, just as the rest of the farm animals rally around her. Alison, a veterinarian, promises that as soon as Sweet Pea recovers, she'll get to have a ""sheep-over"" party with her friends. The story is based on real-life events and animals on the Churchmans' farm in Vermont, which the authors detailed on their Facebook page and then turned into a picture book. The book was originally self-published, then bought by Little, Brown as part of a three-book deal.
","The big cast of characters (farm dogs, three sheep, a goat, a rooster, a fox, and more) and fractured story line make it a bit hard for kids to follow. In the first half of the story, the farm animals sweetly rally around Sweet Pea not only to alert Farmer John to her illness but also to help her recover. The human characters, including Farmer John, his wife, and veterinarian Alison also model for young readers how to take care of animals. In the second half of the book, Sweet Pea and friends enjoy a sleepover party that veers toward the fantastic. The connection between the two story lines is a promise from Alison that Sweet Pea can have a sleepover party with her friends when she recovers. While both story lines are cute, little kids may get confused by the long and meandering story as well as by the contrast between real-life events in the first half and make-believe ones in the second.

"Wildwood Imperium: The Wildwood Chronicles, Book 3","Satisfying end to highly original, whimsical fantasy.","Zita, the May Queen, unwisely conducts a seance that awakens the Verdant Empress, a malevolent spirit that mourns for her long-lost son. Elsewhere in Wildwood, a group of ""unadoptable"" orphans joins up with a collective of saboteurs to rescue their friends held captive somewhere in an industrial wasteland. And fate brings two old friends closer together as they struggle to protect a blind old man and a bear with prosthetic hooks for hands, the only two who might be able to reanimate a mechanical toy prince.
","After stumbling a bit in Under Wildwood, the second volume, The Wildwood Chronicles rights itself and arrives at a satisfying conclusion. Favorite characters return and are displayed in a new light. New threats appear, and the large cast of good guys must be extra-clever in defeating them. Colin Meloy's lively prose and Carson Ellis' evocative illustrations bring the fantastical forest to abundant life. WILDWOOD IMPERIUM is a fitting end to a highly original fantasy trilogy.","Parents need to know that Wildwood Imperium is the concluding volume of the trilogy begun in Wildwood by Colin Meloy (lead singer, guitarist, and songwriter for the folk-rock band the Decemberists). It brings many story strands together for a satisfying conclusion and displays favorite characters in a new light.

Despite a climactic battle against a magical empress who controls ivy, the level of violence is lower than in previous volumes.

Warm Bodies,Gory but sweet romance of teen girl and zombie.,"In a city left derelict by global upheaval, plague, and disaster, humans take refuge in the football stadium while zombies dwell in the ruined airport between brain-eating expeditions. On one such raid, zombie R devours the brains of a teenage boy -- and inexplicably wants to protect the kid's girlfriend, Julie. Between R's friends who want to devour Julie, and her friends who want to kill R, many hazards face this unlikely couple, whose budding relationship seems to have odd effects on the world around them.
","Readers well versed in zombie literature will take the gore in WARM BODIES in stride and enjoy the quirky, world-saving variations on the theme. More sensitive readers might find the plentiful blood, brains, bones, and dismemberment a barrier to their appreciating, or even getting to, much of the book's fundamental sweetness. The writing is lively, the characters intriguing, and the creative reinvention of popular themes is thought-provoking.","Parents need to know that Warm Bodies is a zombie romance story -- also a movie -- being heavily marketed to the Twilight set. On the one hand, it has gory scenes galore of brain-eating zombies, zombie-torturing humans, and much violent death and dismemberment of human and zombie alike. Not to mention descriptions of zombie sex, which seems to involve more confusion than physical contact. On the other hand, its fundamental message, however weirdly framed, is pretty much sunshine-and-butterflies sweetness, as the unlikely love between zombie R and the girl whose boyfriend he's just devoured may be the start of a better world than the devastated, post-apocalyptic one they currently inhabit.

All the Answers,Worried girl gets magical pencil in reassuring story.,"When Ava and her best friend, Sophie, discover a pencil that answers factual questions when you write them in the margins of your paper, they are delighted and overwhelmed. They begin to ask it everything they can dream up, from test questions to which boys have crushes on Sophie. But soon Ava begins to realize that always getting the answers isn't right, and some things are simply too difficult to know in advance. What follows is a fun, provocative adventure that teaches them about the power of knowledge and how hard it can be to do the right thing.
","This is a deceptively simple book; it appears to be about a fun pencil, but it opens up a world of big questions about life, death, knowledge, and purpose that are incredibly moving. Here, Ava and her friends grapple with real-life middle schooler desires and questions -- Which boys like me? What's the answer to this science question? -- and much larger concerns, such as whether her parents will divorce or die nd how to find a happy balance between what we can know and do something about and what we must give up to free will.
This is a great, reassuring book for kids who have a lot of worries, or kids dealing with an ill parent, or kids who have recently lost grandparents to illness or death. It's very thoughtful and has some heavy themes, but the overall feeling is about how to cope with whatever life throws your way. ","Parents need to know that All the Answers tells the story of Ava, who discovers a magic pencil that provides answers to every factual question she asks. The book deals mostly with the thrill of discovery and the thirst for knowledge, as well as the ethical dilemma inherent in the gift, but it also addresses a grandparent's death and a parent's cancer diagnosis. Ava's a worrier, and the book deals heavily with her imagining all the things that can go wrong. There are some heavy themes of loss, anxiety, and grief, along with provocative ideas that foster curiosity and very sweet intergenerational relationships that make this a great book for curious readers.

This Vast Land: A Young Man's Journal of the Lewis and Clark Expedition,"Fascinating historical fiction with graphic sex, violence.","George is only 17 when he introduces himself to Captain Merriweather Lewis and asks to join his expedition. At first Lewis brushes him off, but George is persistent. When Lewis reluctantly takes him on, he gives George a blank journal book and orders him to fill it out every day. George keeps it faithfully, though of course not every day, for the three years of the Expedition, and sporadically for the next 30 years of his life. George, a well-educated city boy, knows nothing of the wilderness, hunting, or soldiering, but he is a quick study, and his enthusiasm and loyalty prove to be even greater qualities. He becomes a valuable asset to the Expedition on their arduous journey. The team encounters bear and Indian attacks, experiences severe privations and illness, crosses the Rockies on foot, canoes through rapids and the waves of the Pacific, and traverses across forbidding and almost inaccessible lands as they travel all the way across the continent and back again. Along the way George learns the skills of a hunter, soldier, and mountain man, falls in love with an Indian woman, and comes to love the wilderness so much that he plans to return there to live with his wife and child after the Expedition is over.

","Teens will find this fascinating and gripping. The late Stephen Ambrose, world-renowned historian, completed this fictionalized journal of the Lewis and Clark expedition's youngest member, George Shannon, just before his death. This book -- his only work of fiction -- is pure adventure, unvarnished with the tricks of the fiction-writer's craft. This is no character study; the personality and experiences of George Shannon are completely invented, and he is used primarily as a lens to show the experience from a young person's point of view.
The sometimes salty and deliberately fractured language is accessible to younger readers, but an extremely graphic sex scene in the middle of the book will make adults hesitate to give it to elementary or middle school students. Nevertheless, for high school students learning about this amazing journey, this book may be the best place to start.","Parents need to know that this is a fictionalized journal of the Lewis and Clark expedition's youngest member, written by the late Stephen Ambrose, a world-renowned historian.

The Little Engine That Could,"Charming, encouraging picture book engages and inspires.","This classic edition of THE LITTLE ENGINE THAT COULD was first published in 1930, by \""Watty Piper,\"" a pen name of Arnold Munk, who was a partner in the book's original publishing company, Platt & Munk. Versions of the story had previously appeared in magazines and anthologies, but his was the first version in book form. Little Engine begins with descriptions of a happy little train engine pulling a full load of cargo, on its way to children on the other side of the mountain. In the train is food -- including apples, oranges, bottles of milk, and more -- and toys for children to play with. When the happy engine breaks down, a toy clown asks other engines to pull the train over the mountain, with no success, until the cheerful Little Engine says, \""I think I can.\""
","The Little Engine That Could is still a must-read for young children. Not only is the engaging story as charming and encouraging as can be, the illustrations by George and Doris Hauman are delicious to pore over with a youngster who's learning to count, or identify objects and colors.

"Robots & Repeats: Secret Coders, Book 4","Heavy on the coding, lighter on the action this time.","Picking up right where the earlier volume left off, ROBOTS AND REPEATS has the Coders figuring out how to escape from a maze. They solve the puzzle, and not only are they reunited with their beloved teacher, Professor Bee, but they also take possession of the Turtle of Light, the only weapon likely to stop Dr. One-Zero. Using the Turtle takes some special skills, and Hopper, Josh, and Eni practice some exercises in logic that bring them closer to saving Stately Academy and determining the whereabouts of Hopper's missing father.
","Learning to code requires patience and dedication, and this latest chapter slows the story down to make sure readers understand the programming fundamentals. Nevertheless, Robots and Repeats has insight and charm to spare, as the Coders solve various puzzles and attempt to thwart the evil plans of Dr. One-Zero.

Juana & Lucas,Colombian girl learns English in fun early chapter book.,"In JUANA & LUCAS, Juana describes her life in Bogotá, Colombia, where ""the air feels clean and delicious, and smells like fresh fruit and bread."" Juana has a happy, cosmopolitan life with friends and family, though at school she struggles with math and fears the parent-teacher conference. Things take a turn for the worse when a teacher introduces English class. Juana asks a series of adults why she should have to learn English, and they all present different reasons. But when her abuelo promises her a trip to Spaceland in Orlando, Florida, she gets the motivation she needs. By the end, she's jabbering in English with anyone who'll listen: ""Because I can speak English so well, I've been able to have fun with a lot of people and make a lot of good friends. And who wouldn't like for that to happen all around the world?"" Exactly!
","For readers who are graduating to chapter books but still like their art full-color, this book, which seamlessly incorporates easy Spanish vocabulary, is muy fun. Juana & Lucas by author-illustrator Juana Medina is narrated by a schoolgirl from Bogotá, Colombia, a likable, relatable character who's strong-willed and funny. Juana's life in Bogotá isn't so different from middle-class life in the U.S., and the story's full of cozy foreign detail. For instance, though Bogotá's temperate by day, it's colder at night, ""so everyone always keeps a pair of slippers by their bed.""
Medina displays a lyrical touch when conveying her love of the city. Looking out at the lights at night ""looks as if the city is wrapped in a blanket of stars."" She's also funny, pulling some information directly from the narrative to illustrate Juana's strong opinions about topics that range from why she hates her uniform to why she loves her dog, Lucas, and her enviably big web of friends and family. Much of the humor stems from her trying to learn a foreign language. When her teacher tells the class they're going to learn ""the English,"" Juana gets a paper cut and cries out, ""Ayayay!,"" but the teacher corrects her: "" ... in English it's Ouch!"" This inviting book gives readers a very happy glimpse of a young girl's life in a cosmopolitan Latin American city.","Parents need to know that Juana Medina's award-winning Juana & Lucas is the first book in a new chapter-book series set in Bogotá, Colombia, that seamlessly incorporates Spanish vocabulary. Illustrated with lots of full-color art nd told in 11 short and breezy chapters, it's perfect for kids making the transition from beginning-to-read books to chapter books. The sprinkle of Spanish adds flavor to the story nd is a snap to understand. Many words are close cousins with English; for instance, Juana visits neighbors in their apartamento nd describes something as fantástico. But Medina always keeps it simple and clear from context: ""I already know plenty of songs to cantar in Spanish."" With an opinionated, funny narrator; her cute dog, Lucas; brimming bookshelves in every home; and a best friend who's a different race, Juana & Lucas introduces readers to a character who feels like a fun new friend.

The Cool Bean,"Sweet, whimsical tale encourages empathy and kindness.","The story begins as an adorably nerdy chickpea introduces ""the cool beans"" -- friends with whom he's grown apart over the last year. He misses them, but he doesn't know what to do. He tries to be cool like them with sunglasses (too big), a slick hairdo (too slick), and adopting a swagger (that makes him trip). He still gets picked last, snorts when he laughs, and runs into things -- he declares himself an uncool ""has-bean."" He thinks this is just the way it's going to be until his very bad day is made pretty darn good by the empathy shown to him by his old friends. The ""uncool"" bean learns the secret to being cool -- nd to being a good friend.  ","This witty story, full of wonderful messages about the importance of friendship, compassion, and helping others, is a joy to read with little ones. Preschoolers will delight in The Cool Bean's hilarious pictures, older kids will relate to the story, and parents will appreciate author Jory John's lighthearted approach to teaching values nd giggle at Pete Oswald's bean puns. The uncluttered spreads featuring sunglass-clad, guitar-playing, superhero-drawing beans reveal Oswald's skill at bringing out tons of personality in his bland subjects.
 One small critique is that there's no apology from the cool beans for leaving out their old friend or reason given for why the cool beans choose that particular day to be kind and inclusive; some kids may wonder about this. Still, readers of all ages will adore this fun, heartfelt book.","Parents need to know that The Cool Bean is by Jory John nd illustrator Pete Oswald, the duo behind the best-selling picture books The Bad Seed and The Good Egg.

The cool beans don't pay their old friend much attention, until a really bad day, when they come to his aid. The way the cool beans emerge as role models offers a great opportunity to talk to young readers about the importance of being kind and helping, not hurting or excluding, others.

The Postcard,Unlikely but pleasant mystery with noir overtones.,"When the grandmother he has never met dies, Jason joins his father in Florida for the funeral and to pack up her house. After his father falls from a ladder and is hospitalized, Jason finds a series of clues on postcards that lead him to chapters of a '40s noir mystery story that may be about his grandmother and her strange and mysterious past. To add to the intrigue, someone seems to be following him.
","When you reach the end of the book you'll realize that the mystery is rather contrived. But by then you won't really care, because you'll have had such a good time getting there. Adding to the fun is the story-within-a-story, nicely done in the deliberately dreadful style of '40s potboiler detective fiction. Because Jason and his friend Dia have to follow clues to find each chapter, the story is revealed to them (and to the reader) gradually, with much anticipation and cliff-hangers, just as the stories that were once serialized in newspapers and magazines used to do.
As with so many books for kids these days, the editors seem to be on holiday. The book's 358 pages is about 150 pages longer than it needed to be. But Abbott's prose style goes down so effortlessly, and the story is so compelling in a don't-think-too-closely-about-it sort of way, that young readers will hardly notice. This is like one of those mystery weekends -- clever clues, no real danger, a bit of silly melodrama, and absurd but fun characters straight out of B-movie casting. Jason and his family and friends deal with real problems and are likable in a realistic way; the rest is a load of very charming hooey.","Parents need to know that there is some violence here, but it's mostly played lightly. In order to have the freedom to pursue the mystery, Jason lies to his mother, the police, and the neighbor who is supposed to take care of him.

Wintergirls,"Disturbing, lauded eating disorder read; discuss with teens.","Eighteen-year-old Lia wakes up to learn her former best friend, Cassie, has killed herself. The night she died she called Lia 33 times, and Lia didn't answer. In fifth grade, they were best friends, so close they swore to help each other be the skinniest girls in high school. When their eating disorders spiral out of control and repeated stays in treatment centers don't help, Lia finally distances herself from Cassie. Even though Lia can't give up her obsession with losing weight, she hates herself and relieves some of her mental anguish by cutting and self-medication. Her parents try to help but are easily fooled into believing she is better, even after Cassie dies from bulimia. Cassie continues to encourage Lia to starve herself even after she is dead by haunting her; and Lia's guilt helps drive her down into one more bout of starvation that sends her to the hospital again, where she is committed and treated for mental illness.
","WINTERGIRLS is very painful to read and very, very powerful. It is not for the faint of heart, but fans of Laurie Halse Anderson may find it hard to resist. Teens will find it depressing -- parents will find it even more so -- but Anderson's beautiful and evocative writing will compel them to read to the end. Anderson says in an afterward that she wrote this book because of so many readers who asked her to write about eating disorders, cutting, and feeling lost. It's hard to imagine anyone doing a better job.
An innovative style of journal writing is used to further illustrate a troubled mind -- some pages are blank while others feature crossed out words. Lia references fairy tales and fairy tale images that will appeal especially to female readers. This story has more brutality than a fairy tale from the Grimm brothers.  As Lia says, there is no magic cure for girls like her, but there is a tiny, potent thimbleful of hope in the end.
 ","Parents need to know this is a very, very intense book about the mental and physical pain endured by teens with eating disorders. The two main characters, the ""wintergirls"" of the title, both have emotional problems that lead to and exacerbate their disorders. The book starts with Cassie dying from repetitive vomiting. The very graphic detail about their physical deterioration as the girls starve themselves is painful to read. Parents may find this award-winning book educational -- not only about the pressures today's teens feel, but also about the way these girls maintain their lies and how others enable them to do so.

For kicks, Percy includes snippets of Apollo's original ham-it-up orientation video, complete with variety acts, canned laughter, bad poetry, and Percy's sardonic take on it all.

Before many-eyed Argus joins the camp as a security guard, he's ""brained"" with a rock but survives. Old campers come to save new ones when hundreds of monsters attack the camp, with no mention of deaths or injuries. In the camp's Combat Arena, ""the hits are real, and so is the blood.""

The Princess in Black and the Perfect Princess Party,Guests wait while princess fights monsters in fun sequel.,"Princess Magnolia is all set for the perfect birthday party when her glitter-stone ring sounds the alarm that there's a monster attack. She must dash into the broom closet, change out of her puffy pink dress and glass slippers, and get into her Princess in Black pants outfit and boots, jump on her faithful pony, Blackie (after he removes his Frimplepants the unicorn disguise), and fight the monsters that are trying to eat the goats that Duff the goat boy is watching over. The alarm summons her several times, each time delaying when she can open her presents with her party guests. Will she ever get to open them?
","This cute follow-up to the first book should please girls who love imagining a princess party and also enjoy seeing a female superhero fight monsters. The almost-finding-out-her-secret plot is not as original as it was in the first one, however. In Book 1, the nosy Duchess Wigtower almost discovers Princess Magnolia's double life. In this one, it's one of her party guests, Princess Sneezewort. But there's plenty to enjoy in LeUyen Pham's colorful illustrations, including the array of diverse, decked-out princesses and the different monsters' approaches to eating goats -- between giant pieces of bread in a sandwich, in a giant bun like a hot dog, and stuffed in a giant ice cream cone. And it's clever how increasingly tired and disheveled the Princess in Black looks as the day goes on.
The one twist is a monster giving her jewels when he finds out it's her birthday -- and her in turn giving them to her guests who've been waiting so long.","Parents need to know that The Princess in Black and the Perfect Princess Party is the second in the Princess in Black chapter book series by Shannon Hale and Dean Hale and illustrated by LeUyen Pham, but it easily works as a standalone. Book 1 introduced Princess Magnolia, who leads a double life, bravely -- and secretly -- sending goat-eating monsters back underground to Monster Land after her glitter-stone ring sounds the alarm. In this story, she's repeatedly summoned, causing repeated delays in opening presents at her birthday party.

"The Testaments: The Handmaid's Tale, Book 2","Brilliant, violent sequel is worthy of the orginal.","THE TESTAMENTS is author Margaret Atwood's sequel to her bestselling novel The Handmaid's Tale. It picks up more than a decade after The Handmaid's Tale ends, and takes readers back inside the Republic of Gilead, the oppressive society that the former United States of America has become. As in the first novel, men and women are divided by gender, function, and caste, and girls are given little education. Instead, they are raised to be obedient and to fear men; they are taught that their voluminous dresses and subdued behavior will protect them from being defiled. The men in charge are called Commanders, while women may serve as wives, Handmaids (who bear Commanders' children when wives can't), Marthas (who do housework), or chaste Aunts, who safeguard laws, records, and education. Events mainly concern the daughters of a former Handmaid and the roles they have to play in exposing the cruelty and corruption within Gilead. The girls long to be reunited with their biological mother, who fled Gilead in the first novel, though they don't know where she is or even if she's still alive. They're assisted by Mayday, a resistance group with members in Canada and inside Gilead. Like The Handmaid's Tale, The Testaments is a scathing indictment of societal forces that purport to protect people but actually oppress them. It encourages readers to question authority, and to value freedom over safety. ","This chilling sequel bout a dystopian society that oppresses women and girls is a page turner that's a worthy followup to the original novel. To readers who have read The Handmaid's Tale, or watched the film or award-winning Hulu TV series, the world of Gilead will be a known quantity, so The Testaments may not have the same shock value that its precursor did when it was new. However, this book may be even more engaging for teen readers, as two of the main characters are young adults. And it will make teens think about issues affecting women and gender roles. Author Margaret Atwood is brilliant at creating her complex, threatening, dystopian world, while still grounding her characters in the most essential values of family and freedom.","Parents need to know that Margaret Atwood's The Testaments is the sequel to her bestselling dystopian novel The Handmaid's Tale, which was also adapted for the 1990 film and the Hulu television series of the same name. The Testaments picks up more than a decade after the end of The Handmaid's Tale, and answers some of the questions the reader was left with at the end of the original novel. Like The Handmaid's Tale, The Testaments mainly takes place in the fictional Republic of Gilead (formerly the United States of America), where roles for women and men are strictly prescribed, and divided by gender and caste. A girl's education is extremely limited, and her future is determined by the status of her parents. In the novel, women and girls wear garments that reflect their roles, and they are forbidden from ""enticing"" men. Anyone whose behavior breaks Gilead's strict rules of conduct may be shot, hung, or subject to a Particicution, in which the offender is literally torn apart. Violence includes a car bombing, a gorey Caesarian section, and the sexual molestation of a young woman by her dentist, which is graphically described. The threat of violence is always present for Atwood's characters, as girls are raised to fear being raped if they reveal any part of themselves to a man. Strong language is frequent (""f--k"" and ""s--t""), and there are mentions people drinking nd dealing and using drugs, but none of those behaviors is presented graphically. The disturbing nature of The Testaments lies in the oppressive, corrupt world that Atwood creates.

The Astonishing Secret of Awesome Man,Exciting look at the fun (and fatigue) of being a superhero.,"Awesome Man is a busy guy. He's got to fight robots, slimebots, and his arch nemesis Flaming Eyeball, and sometimes he gets so busy he forgets to stop, eat, and chill out for a while. Good thing he has his equally awesome secret identity that lets him take a break from his superhero duties. Readers get to find out all about his adventures and his secret identity, too -- can you guess what it is?
","This book is awesome, like Awesome Man. It's fun, exciting, and readers can readily identify with all of the adventures of this superhero -- before they find out his secret identity. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael Chabon does a fantastic job of capturing the creative and open qualities of imaginative play. What makes the story even awesome-r is that Chabon doesn't forget the trials of being a superhero -- running out of energy (needing a snack), staving off trashing a city in anger (temper tantrum), and needing a big hug from a superhero's biggest ally, his mom.
The dazzling illustrations by Jake Parker are bright and engaging. They are almost begging to be used as room decorations for superhero fans. The astonishing secret isn't so astonishing, but Chabon's connection to the life of a child is pretty close.",Parents need to know this is a great picture book for new and reluctant readers. The simple but fun text goes a long way in engaging kids who love to imagine. There is some cartoon violence -- without injury. ,,5,4,Michael Chabon,Fantasy,Superheroes,Fiction,Balzer + Bray,"September 6, 2011",4 - 8,40,,"March 05, 2019",Jake Parker,,,,,
Anno's U.S.A.,A wordless witness to history.,"Mitsumasa Anno's journeys are cultural and historical geographies of the highest order. Without words but with absolutely captivating artwork, readers follow the peregrinations of the little blue man on horseback as he trots through time and space across the USA, meeting Whistler's mother, seeing the Alamo, and witnessing a zoo escape in New York City, among many events. Anno's traveler lands his rowboat first in Hawaii and then makes his way across the continental United States on horseback. Along the way he moves back in time, but there are time shifts on each two-page spread: They might be homesteading on the Plains, but they are also playing basketball. Icons in American cultural and political history are sprinkled tantalizingly throughout the pages. Eventually the traveler makes it to the East Coast, there to find the Mayflower and then, as he pushes off in his rowboat, the Santa Maria.
","Readers will come to both envy and cherish the traveler in this wordless book -- in Mitsumasa Anno's entire series of books, for that matter. He gets the chance to serve as witness to so many fabulous events in history and offers soothing comradeship: Rarely has one who has spoken so little conveyed so much. Reading this book in a library is a perfect setting. A squadron of 7-year-olds was sent scurrying to gather additional books to explain the many references: ""Go get a book on George Caleb Bingham,"" they were instructed. To have the material further illustrated made the history quite real for these children.
The hide-and-seek setting is not an end in itself for Anno, but a springboard. Once you have found Waldo, that's that; once you have identified two jokers trying to move a piano in the streets of colonial Boston, it is just the beginning of an acquaintance with Laurel and Hardy.","Parents need to know that this is a selective visual history of the United States, full of cunning and humor, with each two-page spread capable of sparking an extended discussion on the pictured locale. The horse rider's journey is depicted in stunning, playful, pen-and-wash detail. There are no words, so participation in a read-aloud is critical. Finding recognizable images is as fun as a treasure hunt.

On the Fence,Sweet romance takes sporty teen out of her comfort zone.,"ON THE FENCE is narrated by tough Charlie, the youngest child (and only girl) in a family of four wild kids who are constantly playing and watching sports together. After Charlie gets another speeding ticket, her single dad makes her get a job to pay the fine. She starts working at a boutique, dressing femininely for the first time and even getting side work as a makeup model. Though not exactly comfortable with these changes, Charlie does make new friends and try new things, helping her start “realizing that maybe there was more to me than I realized.” She also realizes that her feelings for her next-door neighbor -- a boy she often has heart-to-heart talks with late at night at their shared fence line -- go way beyond friendship. And she suspects there may be more to the accident that killed her mom than she knows about.
","The story line bout Charlie’s mother seems straight out of a soap opera, but readers will find the narrator a likable character with a relatable problem. She thinks that because she's a tough, athletic girl, Braden can see her only as “his buddy,” not as girlfriend material. Author Kasie West not only breaks down this outdated assumption, she also allows Charlie to grow new facets of her identity -- and accept herself --  without having to throw any of the girly girls who befriend her under the bus.
Charlie's growing feeling for her neighbor Braden -- built on years of hanging out and lots of recent intimate late-night conversations -- is sweet and provides a positive model for young teen romance readers. ","Parents need to know that On the Fence is a fairly tame teen romance. Charlie goes out on dates with a boy and kisses him in her family's hot tub. Later, she and Braden kiss, too, (and she tells him he's a better kisser). The darkest material has to do with Charlie and Braden's parents: Her mom was depressed and killed herself, and Charlie -- who can't remember -- has bloody nightmares; and Braden's dad has a drinking problem and gave him a black eye while drunk. Ultimately, there is a sweet message here about being true to yourself while also allowing yourself to explore new aspects of your identity. Also, readers might appreciate that Charlie is of Mexican decent, since there's  lack of non-white protagonists in literature for young people.

Many Moons,A charming and well-illustrated tale.,"All the king's specialists can't get the moon for his daughter, but the jester does. How? By asking the princess the right questions and acting on her answers. There's another worrisome problem, and again it's the jester who sees the solution--after the princess points it out. Kids will appreciate that a child helps solve the problem in this charming and well-illustrated tale.

","This re-illustrated classic comes stylishly dressed in Marc Simont's watercolors, which sweep across the pages. The jester leaps into the king's presence, the king eloquently frowns at the royal mathematician's swarm of equations, and the princess assesses the moon as she stands in a shadow.
James Thurber's text is graceful and witty. Ten-year-old Lenore's illness isn't all that serious, but her father's reaction to it is touching: She wants the moon, he'll get her the moon. The silly wise men's lists of their absurd accomplishments are mixed with their wives' shopping lists, adding extra humor. Kids will appreciate that the young princess and the childlike jester solve the story's problems.","Parents need to know that there's nothing of concern in this classic, which has been enjoyed by adults and children for more than half a century.

"The Amber Spyglass: His Dark Materials, Book 3",Intense fantasy series finale with controversial theme.,"With the help of two lesser angels, Will rescues Lyra, held a drugged captive, at the end of The Subtle Knife by her evil mother, who may or may not have discovered her maternal instinct. Once free, they make for the world of the dead, to free the spirits of the dead into oblivion, which is far better than the hellacious afterlife they lead. Meanwhile the Church plots Lyra's murder, as they believe her to be a new Eve, who will bring about another Fall; Lord Asriel readies his forces for battle with Metatron, the angel who has taken over heaven from the decrepit and feeble-minded Authority; Dr. Mary Malone ends up in a world of gentle creatures who can see Dust, and begins making discoveries about the changes all the worlds are suffering; and all the worlds and all the races begin taking sides for the final climactic battle.
","If you haven't read the first two books, don't even think of trying to read this one first -- Pullman, praise be, wastes no time bringing readers up to speed. In fact, even if you have read the previous books, you may want to reread them before tackling this -- there's a lot to keep track of.
Readers who were expecting the conclusion of the trilogy to make all things clear may be disappointed; Pullman has a lot to say, but he also leaves a lot for readers to figure out themselves. Still, the author hasn't lost his touch -- it's as riveting and fast-paced as ever. His characterizations are even stronger, although his plotting is weaker here than in the first two books; there's a lot of meandering about, setups that promise more than they deliver, and plot lines that just peter out. But Pullman's point seems clear enough to perceptive and more mature readers: The only heaven is in our own world, and the best we can hope for after life is oblivion. If this idea is offensive to you, then this book will be also. Those able to support -- or at least tolerate his perspective -- will find a feverishly exciting adventure.","Parents need to know that there's a fair amount of violence here, some gory, though not as much nor as graphic as the second book in the series. Though handled with great delicacy and discretion, part of the plot revolves around the sexual awakening of the two main characters. There are also themes in this one that are bound to upset some religious readers: The author manages to question just about everything about religion in this book while he sends his main characters on trips through Heaven and Hell. You'll also find more bad guys in the rigid religious institutions than anywhere, and one Father is sent by the church to kill a main character. However, kids caught up in the fantasy and action will probably miss most of the book's theological leanings.

Playground Day!,Bouncy preschool read with terrific illustrations.,"A little girl races through the park pretending to be animals as she swings and slides on the playground equipment.
","Vivid illustrations really make this book stand out. Fuzzy, textured, and warm, the detailed pictures are rendered almost entirely in carefully torn paper and cut cloth. The result is pictures you long to touch.
If kids look closely they'll see stuffed toys accompany the little girl as she makes her way through the playground, giving hints as to what kind of animal she will be next. Kids who notice this all on their own will feel ahead of the game -- it's a bit like that ""look mom!"" moment when they conquer a new physical feat at the playground.","Parents need to know that there is nothing offensive in this book about a trip to the playground. It may encourage more excitement about creative outdoor play.

Half a World Away,Troubled adopted boy learns to open heart in moving tale.,"Jaden is a 12-year-old Romanian boy who was adopted at age 8 and has had trouble adapting to his life and family in America. He has been through years of counseling and his parents, especially his adoptive mother, never give up on him, but Jaden still lies, steals, and consciously manipulates his parents. When the family travels to Kazakhstan to adopt a new baby, Jaden's feelings are mixed. On one hand, he is afraid the baby will supplant his role in the family and that he'll be neglected. On the other, he is interested in the country and feels sorry for the orphans he visits because he knows he understands better than anyone what they're going through.
","The simple, direct language makes this book to get absorbed in, and the descriptions of life in Kazakhstan, with its camels, hunting eagles, and barren but beautiful landscape, are fascinating. As in her National Book Award-winning The Thing About Luck, author Cynthia Kadohata's deep and complex characterizations make it easy to imagine a life likely vastly different from those of most readers. Jaden's candor about his past and his inability to adjust to life with his adoptive family makes him, if not exactly likable, an intriguing character whom readers will want to get to know better, and his emotional growth is believable and moving.

Ender's Game,Boy genius trains to crush alien invasion in sci-fi classic.,"In ENDER’S GAME, the Earth has been attacked twice by aliens called Formics, or more popularly, Buggers, and everyone is sure a third invasion is coming. So the military embarks on a crash program to breed the ultimate military genius to lead the fleet in a pre-emptive attack against the Formic homeworld. These kids are trained from age 6 in an off-world facility called Battle School, and their training consists mostly of games. Ender Wiggins may be the child they are looking for. Brilliant, compassionate, and tormented, he's better at the games than anyone has ever been. But how can they manipulate a compassionate child into wiping out an entire species, and at the same time give him the skills to do it effectively? The adults who run the school are literally out to save the world: They will stop at nothing to achieve their ends, and one small boy, or even a school full of kids, is nothing but a means to that end.
","Considered by some to be the best sci-fi novel ever written, Enders Game hits the trifecta: deeply emotional and character-driven, brilliantly intellectual, and exciting as all get out. This is the kind of book the phrase ""page-turner"" was invented to describe: Most people finish it in one sitting, unable to put it down.
But the images and ideas linger long after the last thrilling page is turned, making it a perfect discussion book, even for reluctant readers. Its view of politics in the Internet age is prescient, especially considering it was written decades ago, and as a treatise on ruthless education it's without peer. Though it wasn't written for children, it has been embraced by middle- and high-schoolers. The violence can be quite disturbing to parents, who might want to preview it.","Parents need to know that Ender's Game is a gripping and emotional sci-fi novel that will appeal to older tweens and teens. The violence is at times quite brutal, as kids kill other kids and the main character's admired for his ruthlessly efficient violence, though he himself is disturbed by it. Some bullying by an older brother is intense and disturbing, and the conclusion to the story is shocking.

The engaging story makes young readers want to know more about the subject.
 ","Torn by conflicting emotions, author Ji-Li Jiang is the perfect guide to the complexities of the Cultural Revolution, which many readers will encounter for the first time here. She struggles to be a good Communist almost to the end of the book, even trying at one point to change her name to avoid being identified with the landlord Jiangs. At the same time, Ji-Li is too intelligent to ignore the ironies and contradictions in her tormentors' dogma.

A Hive for the Honeybee,Insect allegory might be too slow for most kids.,"In the hive everyone has their roles: the queen lays eggs, the female workers tend the hive and make the honey, and the male drones lay around, get drunk, and think up government and religious rituals to pass the time while waiting for a chance to mate with the queen. But three bees, Thora, Albert, and Mo, don't seem to fit their roles. Thora, a worker, dreams of idleness and freedom. Albert, a drone, is a poet who thinks in metaphors, and Mo is a rebel who questions everything.
But life in the hive is not conducive to divergent thinking. Sensible workers don't have the time or patience for foolishness, and drones, filled with a sense of their own importance that the workers don't share, feel threatened. And when Mo tries to make peace with the hive's traditional enemies, the wasps, it's the workers, as usual, who have to clean up the mess.
","This won't work for most children: As a story, aside from its metaphorical merits, the first half is slow and dull, and by the time it picks up, most young readers will have put it aside. Even the illustrations of bees with stilt legs and human faces are oddly creepy. Experienced, patient young readers might continue to plow through, and in a discussion group, it might provoke some interesting conversations. But as well-written, well-intentioned, and clever as it is in its way, it's best for the most avid and intellectual young readers.
Writing allegories for children is a dicey business. Because many kids will not get the symbolism, at least not without adult guidance, the story has to be good enough to hold them on its own. Reviewing allegories for children can also be problematic: it's all too easy for adult reviewers to get excited about the deeper meanings and forget who the target audience is.","Parents need to know that this story is intended to provoke discussion about society, sex roles, social classes, art, religion, government, and more. But whether it actually will provoke those discussions depends on whether your kid is one of the few who will finish it voluntarily. The queen bee mates with many partners, and a mouse is violently killed in battle.

The hero, Nailer, lives a gritty, desperate life scavenging copper wire from the ducts of beached oil tankers while dreaming of sailing away on one of the high-tech clipper ships that are bound for higher seas and a better world. Much like a character from Charles Dicken's Oliver Twist, Nailer finds safety and survival by being part of a crew of scavengers, but he has to make quota each day to keep his place. On top of that, his father is a mean, raging abuser of alcohol and crystal slide, all of which does not make his life any easier.

dependence on oil and unfair labor practices, as well as why dystopian novels are so popular -- and what they can teach us.

Snuggle Wuggle,Art fails to convey warmth of story.,"How does a cub hug? ""Cozy dozy, cozy dozy"" is the answer. Every animal baby gets a hug and a silly sound, and, in no time, children will be trying out different animal hugs and chanting along. A good read-aloud story. Despite the mismatched artwork, it's bound to become a popular request.
 ","Illustrator Michael Rex offers some visual humor, such as the daisies around the deer who hug ""lazy daisy, lazy daisy."" A nice twist at the end shows a child getting a good-night hug, with the same 12 stuffed animals on her bed as were discussed in the story.
But some of the animals' eyes are so round and big that they look like golf balls, and give the impression of permanent surprise. The animals, drawn in colored pencil, are simply placed on white backgrounds that don't add any warmth to the cozy tale.","Parents need to know that kids will read and hug right along after a few pages.

My Thirteenth Winter,Honest story of life with learning disability.,"This memoir chronicles the author's challenges with dyscalculia, a learning disability that affects the ability to accomplish tasks related to sequential processing, making things like telling time, giving change, and opening a locker very difficult. Starting with her earliest memories of learning difficulties, the book continues to show the challenges on the road to her diagnosis at 13, her depression and panic attacks as she grew older, and her slow path to acceptance in college.
","This is a great resource of information and support for kids having experiences similar to Samantha's and ideal for readers who like books about teens overcoming challenges. Most kids take the simple things they do during the day for granted, like giving a cashier the right amount of money to buy lunch, knowing you can chat for five minutes before the next class, or opening a locker easily. These are things that terrified Samantha Abeel. It's hard enough just wanting to fit in, but add to that a profound learning disability and any kid would want to be invisible.
MY THIRTEENTH WINTER gives a detailed account of Samantha's experiences during the school years, leading up to her diagnosis through college. Life is an intense struggle for Samantha, as she honestly describes. The book ends on a realistically optimistic note regarding her future and happiness.","Parents need to know that this memoir chronicles the author's challenges with dyscalculia, a learning disability that affects her ability to accomplish tasks related to sequential processing.

One Plus One Equals Blue,Upbeat tale about kids coping with disadvantages.,"Basil Feeney's mom has left her Pennsylvania town to make it in Hollywood. Homeschooled by his grandmother, Basil enters the seventh grade without knowing he has synesthesia, a neurological condition in which one sensation triggers another -- which could be the reason he's failing math (he confuses numbers and colors). Then he meets another new kid, Tanzie Verplank, who has the same condition, and she shows him how she copes with it. Meanwhile, Basil's flaky mom returns, which leads to a journey of self-discovery for both Tanzie and Basil.
","This sweet but watery tale shows us the challenges of synesthesia, the neurological condition in which one sensation triggers an unrelated one. Not uncommon in artists (Vladimir Nabokov said that he and his mother could taste letters of the alphabet), synesthesia presents wonderful experiences to those who are ready to exploit them. In ONE PLUS ONE EQUALS BLUE, Basil and Tanzie come to terms with the condition in several passages that delight.
But the weight of the story falls on the relationship between Basil and his mother, who abandoned him to seek stardom in Hollywood then falls back into his life. Young readers will relate to Basil's longing for his mother's love, a feeling that's inseparable from his resentment of her selfishness. Ultimately, though, the storylines about synesthesia and poor parenting don't build on each other, and the result is less than compelling.","Parents need to know that One Plus One Equals Blue is unusual coming-of-age story about two preteens dealing with the same problems: synesthesia and parental neglect (synesthesia is the neurological condition, associated with artists, in which one sensation evokes another -- a number looks like a color, for instance). Basil Feeney longs to know that his absent mother loves him, while Tanzie Verplank's parents are more involved in their careers than with her. The cheerful and confident Tanzie helps Basil understand synesthesia and see his mother more clearly. Young readers will follow characters taking important steps toward satisfying selfhood, through a story that, while somewhat predictable, has positive messages and role models -- and is free of violence, language, and other iffy content.

Better Off Friends,"Sweet, funny When Harry Met Sally romance for teens.","In Elizabeth Eulberg's latest romantic comedy, a teen version of When Harry Met Sally, the smart and charming Macallan and Levi take turns sharing their story of how a boy and a girl can actually be best friends. But can they be just friends for long? In flashbacks that span the seventh through the 12th grades, the two take turns recalling the various milestones of their best friendship. At the start of seventh grade, 11-year-old Macallan, grieving her mother's unexpected death, is assigned to show the new kid, Levi, a pony-tailed California transplant to Wisconsin, around their middle school. She's skeptical about him until she realizes he's a fellow super-fan of a long-running British comedy. Soon they're spending all their time together, but as the years pass and girlfriends and boyfriends come and go, Macallan and Levi begin to wonder if what they feel for each other is unconditional friendship, true love, or both.
","Countless movies and stories have explored the issue of whether men and women can be friends without attraction getting in the way, but there's certainly room for this witty, well-crafted take. Eulberg is well known for her sweet, ""clean"" high-school romances (Revenge of the Girl with the Great Personality, The Lonely Hearts Club), and this is her best so far. Inspired by Nora Ephron's When Harry Met Sally screenplay, Eulberg crafts a tale of bantering best pals, who, like Billy Crystal's Harry and Meg Ryan's Sally, prefer each other's company to any one else's -- including people they're supposed to be dating.
Because the point of view changes between the two main characters, it's easy to get caught up in Macallan and Levi's comedy of errors, miscommunication, and missed opportunities. It's obvious to readers, their parents, and even their dates, that they should be together, but taking that step when you have such intertwined lives is understandably frightening and risky. As each year progresses and their unresolved romantic tension continues, Macallan and Levi start acting skittish and uncomfortable around each other -- especially when it comes to their significant others (whom, no surprise, they're never that into). Eulberg does a good job of weaving their shared love of a fictional British comedy duo into the story line without making it obnoxious. Like the odd couple on the show they love, these two may not be much alike, but they share a remarkable, undeniable chemistry that will bring a smile to readers' faces.","Parents need to know that Better Off Friends is best described as a teen adaptation of When Harry Met Sally: the story of guy-girl best friends who realize after several years that they might be destined for something more. Set in Wisconsin, it has a lot of Badger State trivia and references to real state treasures, such as the Packers and the burger-and-frozen-custard joint Culver's. Author Elizabeth Eulberg is known for relatively clean dialogue in novels such as Revenge of the Girl with the Great Personality, but there's one use of ""bitch"" and a few uses of the words ""retard"" and ""retarded,"" which make the protagonist (whose uncle is developmentally delayed) very angry. There's kissing, handholding, and a few brief references to cold showers and nice bodies, but nothing a sixth grader can't handle. Best of all, the book will make readers contemplate another, slower path toward romance in contrast to the usual ""love at first sight"" story lines perpetuated by many young adult novels.

Teacher's Pest: Tales from Lovecraft Middle School #3,Bug-monsters offer light horror hijinks in third volume.,"Having battled demons and snake-monsters, Robert Arthur and Glen Torkells must now face off against a new antagonist, student council president Howard Mergler, who is actually a disgusting bug-monster in disguise. Hordes of wasps, roaches, and lice are infesting the middle school, and no one will believe that there is a connection to the supernatural. Aided by a ghostly girl and a two-headed rat, Robert and Glen must stop the six-legged apocalypse on their own.
","TEACHER'S PEST continues the humorous middle-school horror adventure begun in Professor Gargoyle and The Slither Sisters. It maintains the series' mix of goofy humor and monster mayhem and is likely to satisfy its core audience. But after three installments, some readers may want more of a sense that the overarching narrative is escalating to some kind of payoff, rather than just as series of encounters with random monster archetypes.","Parents need to know that Teacher's Pest is another goofy installment in this silly horror series. There are squirmy insects aplenty, plus a host of monsters from another dimension, but the mayhem they cause is mostly played for laughs.

Tumble & Fall,End-of-the-world story doesn't live up to its premise.,"TUMBLE & FALL is a story about the end of the world with a premise similar to the movies Armageddon and Deep Impact: An asteroid named Persephone is barreling toward Earth and is predicted to collide with the planet -- in only seven days. Three Martha's Vineyard teens deal with the impending apocalypse with wildly differing priorities: Zan, still grieving the loss of her high school love Leo, embarks on a last-minute trip to the mainland to figure out if his love was true; formerly suicidal Sienna has been released from a group home to live with her dad but ends up falling for a guy she meets; and Caden is mysteriously kidnapped by his long-lost father and just wants to get back home.
","Alexandra Coutts has written a catastrophe story that doesn't in any way focus on the widespread chaos that would befall Earth if a huge asteroid were about to strike it. There's no page-turning immediacy and no pulse-pounding scenes of masses trying to escape or survive (The 5th Wave this is not). Instead, Coutts offers a more thoughtful, gentle tale of how three very different teens deal with their own last week on Earth. By setting the book mostly on the lovely New England island of Martha's Vineyard, Coutts doesn't bother with too much of the horrors going on in the rest of the world.
What starts out as a promising idea fails to live up to the grand premise, though, mostly because the three narratives are so unevenly developed, and the three characters' choices are often so difficult to understand. Instead of it seeming romantic that Zan would leave her parents to go on a mission to find out if the perfect, genius surfer poet Leo cheated on her, it's horrifying (at least from an adult perspective) that she'd just up and leave her parents (who are busy creating one last piece of art for the apocalypse). Sienna's desire to find love -- however misguided and certainly brief -- is slightly more palatable, but Caden's crazy story with his rich, estranged father never really works. To make a story about the possibility of The End work, an author needs to make you care. And, although Coutts isn't a bad writer, the slow pace and the characters' incomprehensible decisions make it difficult to invest in this story.","Parents need to know that Tumble & Fall is a natural-disaster story, because it follows the week leading up to  an asteroid's collision with Earth. The book chronicles the reactions of three Martha's Vineyard teens and contains some mature scenes of partying, kissing, and even virginity losing -- as one might expect from adolescents facing the end of the world. Occasional strong language ranges from ""s--t"" and ""f--k"" to ""a--hole."" The three protagonists have various emotional issues and family dysfunction to deal with, so the story will make readers think about what they would want to do or focus on if they were faced with a similar catastrophe.

The Sound of Kwanzaa,Colorful look at the principles the holiday celebrates.,"This very short but sweet book introduces the seven important principles of the African-American holiday Kwanzaa. There's no plot here -- just a song-like recitation of each of the principles that begins each time with, ""Come close, gather 'round./Listen to the sound of Kwanzaa."" Then there's a quick introduction to the principle for that day. The colorful pictures bring each principle to life and invite the reader to think about ways they can also honor Kwanzaa values.
","This is a terrific first book for kids whose families will be observing the holiday or for anyone who is just looking for a simple explanation of what Kwanzaa is and what the principles mean. Readers after a more in-depth take will have to look elsewhere -- and luckily for them there's a bibliography in the back of the book.
There's also an Author's Note, which tells who invented Kwanzaa and when and includes some of the author's thoughts about her own Kwanzaa celebrations when she was a kid. And don't forget to try the recipe included for raw (no-cooking) brownies. (Warning: for most families, a trip to the grocery will be in order since you may not have a dozen large pitted dates at the ready.)
Bright colors and broad strokes infuse these paintings, effectively conveying the warmth and joy of the family and the broader community celebrations that surround Kwanzaa.","Parents need to know that whether or not they celebrate Kwanzaa, this picture book has a positive message for readers.

Where Things Come Back,Unsettling tale of teen's small-town life is good but dark.,"Normal dull life in Lily, AR, is thrown into chaos by the alleged sighting of a long-extinct woodpecker, bringing hordes of media, tourists, and local enterprise. Seventeen-year-old Cullen Witter is dealing with this newfound chaos, a host of adolescent issues, and his ne'er-do-well cousin's death from an overdose when his younger brother inexplicably disappears and his family starts falling apart. Meanwhile, in another time and place, a young missionary has a crisis of faith that will have a fateful impact on these events. Intertwined with all this: Cullen's lively fantasy life, often involving zombies and the woodpecker; also obscure religious texts and song lyrics.
","WHERE THINGS COME BACK is something of a critics' darling -- for good reason, as the quality of writing is well above that of most YA fiction. But it may be overly literary for some teens, who may wish the author would get on with the plot already. Parents may well blanch at the levels of profanity and violence, as well as the overall level of darkness. However, new author Whaley's ability to absolutely nail interesting aspects of human behavior makes it quite memorable.","Parents need to know that this is a quirky, funny, dark, profoundly unsettling book that starts with a cousin's dead body and continues to include a suicide, sex (not explicit), a beloved brother's disappearance, religious mania, zombie movies, and frequent profanity.

None of the Above,Informative tale of a girl who learns she's intersex.,"Krissy is a track star and homecoming queen with a popular boyfriend. After a painful first-time sexual experience with her boyfriend, she visits a doctor who suspects Krissy is intersex (or ""what some people call a hermaphrodite""). She doesn't have a uterus nd quickly decides to have surgery when she learns she has gonads. She tells her two best friends about her diagnosis at a party, and suddenly rumors are flying all over school: Her locker is vandalized, her boyfriend breaks up with her, and her coach says she can't run on the track team until there's an investigation to make sure she can compete in the girl's division. Will nybody be able to accept her -- and will she be able to accept herself?
","NONE OF THE ABOVE follows a pretty typical ""problem novel"" formula, and readers might find it more educational than entertaining. But the book does provide solid information about what it means to be intersex, and it will challenge teens to think about some pretty big questions, such as: What does it mean to be a girl or a boy -- and why do only those two categories exist?
There are now lots of books about gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transsexual characters that make readers think about gender and sexuality; author I.W. Gregorio -- a surgeon who's worked with a young patient with Krissy's diagnosis -- should be applauded for widening the tent even further. ","Parents need to know None of the Above is a novel that educates teen readers about what it means to be intersex, as the protagonist, Krissy, was born with both male and female characteristics. Krissy is bullied both online and at school, and people say hateful things to nd about her. She's attacked at a club by a man when he realizes that she's the intersex teen he's heard about. There's some swearing and drinking, as well as some frank sex talk: After Krissy has very painful sex with her boyfriend, she meets with doctors and they discuss body parts, menstruation, hormones, and dilation kits to help her grow her very short vagina. She has to have surgery to remove her gonads. Krissy has a supportive single father and a good friend she meets through a support group. She eventually learns to stop letting ""other people define who -- and what --"" she is. The author provides additional resources (books and websites) for teen readers to check out.

The Dark,Clever story of a boy who conquers his fear of the dark.,"Lazlo is a afraid of the dark. He sleeps with a night light on and caries a flashlight places where the dark is, like his basement. He personifies the dark, thinking it hides in the closet or behind the shower curtain or washing machine, but goes back to the basement, where it lives, in the morning. He'll open the basement door and greet it: \""'Hi, he would say. 'Hi, dark.'\"" Then one night the dark talks back to Lazlo and shows him something that relieves his fear.
","THE DARK is a clever treatment of one of kids' most universal fears. Author Lemony Snicket and illustrator Jon Klassen do a fantastic job of building suspense and creating a deadpan character with a problem to solve: Lazlo knows that the dark lives in his house and is concerned that it will come into it bedroom rather than stay where it belongs. Lazlo is curious and methodical, and in the end empowered by having mastered the situation. ","Parents need to know that The Dark is a fun picture book about a universal childhood fear: fear of the dark. What's unusual here is that author Lemony Snicket (A Series of Unfortunate Events) and Caldecott-winning author-illustrator Jon Klassen (This Is Not My Hat) have personified the dark. It lives in Lazlo's basement, and he talks to it and it talks back. Lazlo just wants it to stay where it belongs and not come into his room. The two eventually come to terms -- the dark is actully quite friendly and helpful -- and it never bothers Lazlo again. The Dark is not only highly entertaining, with its wonderfully understated tone and dramatic use of light and dark in the illustrations, but it also should provide a great way for kids and parents to open up about their own fears. It's very empowering to see Lazlo conquer one of his.

When the Luggertuck Lump, a prized wig, and other items disappear, suspicion falls upon Horton Halfpott, the humble kitchen boy. He sets out to prove his innocence, find the thief, and protect the girl he just might be failing for.
","Elements of Angleberger’s writing style -- asides to the reader, some very dark humor -- are reminiscent of A Series of Unfortunate Events, but this tale, in tone and plot, is much less grim. Kids will giggle at the Shipless Pirates, who want for even a plank; hiss at M’Lady and Luther’s callous cruelty; and root for the lionhearted Horton to come out the winner. The plot races along with plenty of twists and turns (pauses to provide backstory give readers a chance to breathe). Brief chapters make this a good choice for kids transitioning to longer books. Angleberger has great fun with language, and the dialogue will have kids in fits.

Meanwhile Orpheus tries to gain wealth and power by allying with Adderhead, and the Milksop and the Piper kidnap all the children in Ombra to force Mo to sacrifice himself. Includes summaries of the first two books, glossary, and bibliography for the chapter-head quotes.
","As with the previous books, there's not much narrative discipline, and the editing is flabby, but readers who have made it this far won't care about that, and some may even prefer it that way. Also, don't even think of trying to read this without having read the first two books in the trilogy. Even for those who have read them, and even with the summaries and glossary provided, it can be confusing, what with a hundred or so named characters and numerous criss-crossing plot lines. While fans of Meggie may be disappointed that she is no longer at the center of the action, which has mostly shifted to the adults, series fans will find the same virtues (and vices) here: a big fat book with lots of action and gritty violence (though it's not as dark as Inkspell), skipping around among characters and plotlines, and plenty of imagination and description.

He grows huge, threatening to swallow the bay and even the sun. Shirley chides him, telling him it's rude to gobble everything. She assures him she'd like to be his friend, but he needs to be polite.

Her seventh-grade year is a kind of \""purgatory,\"" and  through narrative verse, she reveals her inner thoughts and feelings -- as well as the familiar markings of a very tough year: She's the first one to raise her hand in class and always has an opinion, but that's not going over well with the other kids. She worries about human rights and other world issues while most of the other kids seem like they couldn't care less. She hates the mean girls but feels their power.

This time it's 13-year-old Addie, whose story is told completely in narrative poetry that poignantly captures the turmoil and confusion she faces. Themes range from learning how to stay strong and smart and sensitive in the face of taunting by ""mean girls"" to overbearing teachers, young love and broken hearts, and how and when to speak your mind. It also juxtaposes the painful but almost silly struggles of middle school with the atrocities that take place around the world: child brides who are raped, disfigured, and sold; battered women; a student driven to suicide by bullying. Addie helps organize the Gay and Straight Alliance in support of her openly gay friends and dares to hold a Day of Silence even when it's nixed by the principal.

Finding Orion,"Heart, humor, discoveries fill oddball family quest tale.","As FINDING ORION begins, 12-year-old Orion Kwirk and his family are just sitting down to taste-test his chemist dad's latest jelly bean flavor (fried chicken, which is a lot better than previous creations garlic and armpit) when the doorbell rings. At the door is a clown, who bursts into a silly-sounding song with a clear message -- Papa Kwirk, the estranged father of Orion's dad, has died. Even for the Kwirks, who are not known for being exactly normal, this is strange. But as they head back to Fletcher Kwirk's hometown for the funeral, they don't know how strange things are going to get. Burglary, gluttony, swordplay, and revelations ensue.
","This unusual family quest story is lots of fun and loaded with heart. This family is Kwirk by name, quirky by nature: Dad a genius chemist, Mom's an astronomer, the kids are all named after constellations, and these are their adventures. Which are unlikely, hilarious, poignant, occasionally on the wrong side of the law, but all on the convoluted path to understanding (and appreciating) who we and our loved ones really are.  Finding Orion's 12-year-old narrator is a highly relatable middle kid trying to cope with being in a family of oddball prodigies when he just wants to be normal.
""It's hard, sometimes, reconciling the difference between what you really feel about something and what you know you're supposed to feel.
""Like when you're sitting in the high school auditorium watching your sister on stage dressed like a freaky cat/human hybrid, singing and slinking around and licking her furry arms. And you know you should be proud of her, because she's your sister and it's one of the lead roles. And you are, sort of, but you're also really tired of sitting there watching this incredibly stupid musical where nothing makes any sense, and you wish the freaking Jellicle cats would just hurry up and get to the Jellicle Ball or maybe be runover by a Jellicle truck so you can go home and zone out with your Playstation.""","Parents need to know that Finding Orion, by beloved middle-grade author John David Anderson, is the tale of an odd quest, the odd family who find themselves on it, and a whole lot of love, misunderstanding, and righting of past wrongs. In the past and in the present, kid and adult characters deal with heavy stuff, including death, war, alcoholism, industrial espionage, family estrangement. There's a lot of humor, a lot of heart, and many inadvisable adventures (from burglarizing backyards to warding off thugs with a sword). And there's the occasional ""piss,"" ""crap,"" and assorted bathroom and gross-out humor. It's a voyage of discovery to understand their recently departed and definitely out-there grandfather, and along the way parents and kids learn a lot about themselves and each other while accumulating tales to last a lifetime.

"Merry Christmas, Splat!",Fluffy cat in a fluffy and sweet holiday tale.,"When Splat asks for a really big present, his sister gives him last-minute doubts: “Are you sure you’ve been good?” Worried, Splat tackles jobs that don’t need doing in hopes of ensuring he’ll measure up. He stays up all night, waiting for Santa so he can tell him how good he’s been. But when Christmas morning dawns, there’s been no sign of Santa. Was Splat good enough?
","As with his earlier books featuring endearing Splat, Rob Scotton’s story plays second fiddle to the fun illustrations. Here they play well to the deadpan text. Kids will giggle at the alarm in his mother’s face when Splat announces his intentions. And the spread where Santa slips, unnoticed, right past the wide-eyed cat will have them in stitches. The color palette -- mostly black-and-white with subtle coloring and bright pops of red and green -- adds to the appeal.
	Kids will relate to Splat’s worries -- and his wish for a big gift. Grownups worn out by the holiday gimme-gimmes may wince.
Whimsical artwork is full of delightful touches.","Parents need to know there’s nothing to worry about in this holiday story. Parents might grumble at Splat’s focus on getting a big present, but that provides an opening to talk with your kids about the value of a gift.

Drum Dream Girl: How One Girl’s Courage Changed Music,"Gorgeous, magical story of a girl with music in her heart.","A young African Chinese Cuban girl hears drumbeats all around her, including in her heart. But she's repeatedly told that girls cannot play drums in Cuba, so she plays her bongo drum alone but dreams of playing freely and in public. Her father refuses to let her play with her sisters' band, but eventually he allows her to have drum lessons. The girl’s teacher marvels at her skill and urges her on until finally she plays for an enthusiastic audience in a starlit garden café.
","Musical text and sumptuous illustrations honor the story of a young girl who wouldn't take no for an answer. Boys and girls will find encouragement to hold fast to their own dreams in this entrancing collaboration by Cuban American poet Margarita Engle and illustrator Rafael Lopez. Engle's poem depicts Cuba as ""the island of music"" nd beautifully describes the girl's ""quiet secret drumbeat dreams.” Keeping her drumming to herself leaves her isolated. It's only when she can share her passion that she seems fully engaged with those around her. Lopez uses rich, warm hues to blend scenes of Cuban life (joyful musicians at a café, costumed dancers on stilts) with fantastic dreamscapes (the girl playing drums as a mermaid in the sea or climbing a tower of drums to beat her rhythm on the very moon). It's a book to treasure.","Parents need to know that Drum Dream Girl -- written by poet Margarita Engle (The Poet Slave of Cuba) and beautifully illustrated by Rafael Lopez (Book Fiesta!) -- is based on the true story of a young girl who broke down barriers for female drummers in Cuba in the 1930s.

Like a Love Story,Emotional tale about self-acceptance set during AIDS crisis.,"In LIKE A LOVE STORY, it's 1989 and Reza is an Iranian immigrant adjusting to his life in New York City with his mom, stepdad, and stepbrother. About to start his first year at an American high school, Reza is terrified that his deepest secret will get out before he even accepts it himself: He's gay. With the AIDS crisis reaching its most devastating point, the idea of living proudly and happily seems like an impossible dream to Reza. All this starts to change when he meets his classmates Art, a rebellious photographer and the only openly gay student at school, and Judy, an aspiring fashion designer who quickly develops a crush on Reza. Together they explore the world of New York, American pop culture, and the iconic music of the '80s. The trio becomes involved with the ACT UP movement under the guidance Judy's uncle Stephen, a gay man living with AIDS who's a dedicated member of the activist group. Reza starts to date Judy in order to hide his identity from his family, but struggles with his feelings for Art. With ACT UP's biggest protest on the horizon and Stephen's health declining, the three friends must face hard truths and emotions to come together for the greater good -- and the love of Madonna.
","Author Abdi Nazemian has crafted a powerful, entertaining story with as many heartrending moments as there are laughs and Madonna references. Partially based on the author's own life experiences, Like a Love Story paints a vibrant and complex portrait of gay culture at a time when the LGBT community was facing one of the darkest chapters in its history. But even when things are at their worst, the resilience of Reza, Art, and Judy shines through and keeps the story moving. Each character feels unique and personal. As we witness the trio navigate such turbulent years, we get to know them at their lowest and highest points; their failures and successes become our failures and successes. And although it can be frustrating when one of them makes a wrong turn, it's all the more rewarding to see how they learn and grow from their mistakes.
The name-dropping of prominent celebrities, popular media, and fashion trends of the may be too heavy-handed for some teens to appreciate, but the wealth of influences present in Like a Love Story help enrich this compelling and worthwhile read.","Parents need to know that Like a Love Story is a coming-of-age story about friendship, love, and activism set against the backdrop of the AIDS crisis in New York City in the late 1980s. It's told from the perspective of three teens, Reza, Art, and Judy, as they navigate relationships, family problems, and high school drama. Judy's uncle Stephen is a gay man with AIDS who serves as a role model to the trio and introduces them to the activist group ACT UP. Death and mortality are recurring topics, and there's an emotional scene in which a supporting character passes away due to an AIDS-related illness. There's plenty of sex talk throughout, though most of it is in the context of promoting safe sex and destigmatizing AIDS. Two teen boys in a relationship lose their virginity to each other. Teens discuss sex and sexuality, make out, and drink alcohol on several occasions. A main character starts a physical fight with a homophobic bully at school. Occasional strong language includes ""Jesus Christ,"" ""damn,"" ""ass,"" ""bitch,"" ""s--t,"" and ""f--k,"" as well as some instances of homophobic and racist name-calling.

The Raven Boys,"Imaginative, twisty tale explores magic, friendship, money.","Maggie Stiefvater's THE RAVEN BOYS is a difficult book to summarize, but to put it simply, it follows 16-year-old Blue Sargeant, who's the daughter and niece of clairvoyants. She's not one herself, but she helps amplify the powers of those around her. For Blue's entire life, she's been told that her kiss will cause her true love to die. On the night of St. Mark's Eve, when those who will die during the upcoming year file through a cemetery in an annual ceremony, Blue sees the ghost of a young man -- something that can only happen to a non-seer if ""you're his true love ... or you killed him."" The boy is Gansey, an Old Money Virginian attending the town's posh boarding school, Aglionby Academy. Having stayed away from boys her whole life, Blue is drawn into the mysterious world of Gansey and his three best friends: quiet Noah, broken Ronan, and ambitious scholarship kid Adam. Blue and the Raven Boys (the school's mascot is a raven) help Gansey with his obsession of finding the final resting place of an enigmatic medieval Welsh king, and the quest leads the five of them to make life-changing discoveries about the paranormal world.
","Some authors' writing is so flowery it appears self-indulgent; Stiefavater is one of very few YA writers who knows how to marry gorgeous turns of phrase with character and plot development. Every metaphor, theme, or lush image has a specific purpose in the story. Like Australian YA author Melina Marchetta, Stiefvater's stories are full of complex characters and multiple storylines that are all important to explore. The four titular Raven boys aren't your typical clique of best pals; they're a complicated bunch of friends. Each has enough psychological issues to deserve his own book (and with three more installments in the series, we'll obviously learn even more about each one).
The most interesting contrast is between the two obvious possibilities for Blue's love: Gansey, whom she sees in her vision and is the driving force behind the search for Glendower's ghost, and Adam, whom she was initially attracted to and who so desperately wants to use his intelligence to leave his trailer-trash background behind and join his best friends in their world of easy privilege. Blue is a fantastic guide into the world of the Anglionby boys. She's been surrounded by her mother and other clairvoyant women her whole life and wants to experience true friendship and adventure -- even if it means risking her heart and the life of her eventual true love. Beautifully written and compellingly paced, this is a unique series that both teens and adult readers will find riveting.","Parents need to know that The Raven Boys is the first in a series from best-selling author Maggie Stiefavter (The Scorpio Races, Shiver) called The Raven Cycle. Like her other novels, the story tackles a fascinating legend -- here, the sleeping king myth -- and couples it with an exploration of small towns, class tensions, father-son relationships, and unconditional friendship. The romance is much subtler/milder than in her other works, but there's a fair amount of mature language and violence (a bloody fight between an abusive father and his son is particularly disturbing, as is the description of a teen's death). Paranormal elements such as ghosts, spells, palmistry, tarot-card reading, and sorcery are all mentioned at length, as is the story's central myth. The protagonist is a strong female character learning to balance her lust for life with her sheltered -- ableit unconventional -- upbringing.

Runemarks,Thrilling epic for experienced fantasy readers.,"""Five hundred years after the End of the World,"" Maddy is growing up an outcast in her small village, where magic is present but forbidden and ignored. But in her friendship with a one-eyed vagrant, she first discovers that she has magic of her own, and then that she is at the center of a battle among the Norse gods, resurgent powers, and the Nine Worlds for control of the universe, a war that didn't end when the world did. Includes maps, character list, and list of runes.
","You have to admire an author who can think big. As armies clash and worlds collide across the infinite plains of Hel, you'll be reminded of other great epic fantasies: Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, or Pullman's His Dark Materials. This may not be on quite the same level as those classics, lacking their propulsive motion along a clear path, but it has their epic scope and exciting grandeur.
Every mythology has its own unique mood and consciousness. If Greek myth has the clarity of the Aegean light, and Egyptian myth the shifting aspect of desert sands, Norse myth has the fuzziness and confusion of the bleak, cold darkness of northern wastes. Readers will get more out of this if they have some familiarity with Norse mythology, but even so, as the worlds of Dream and Chaos impinge on Order, much is left unclear. Still, it's a wild ride with an appealing protagonist, and this post-Ragnarok mash-up will have experienced readers gleefully buzzing through its more than 500 pages.","Parents need to know that this story has, like the Norse mythology upon which it's based, moments of rather grim violence. There's also some swearing and references to drinking, drunkenness, and pipe smoking.

The Return of Zita the Spacegirl,"Final Zita graphic novel with more peril, great role model.","THE RETURN OF ZITA THE SPACEGIRL begins with the young heroine on trial in Dungeon World for her supposed crimes of saving several planets in Zita the Spacegirl and Legends of Zita the Spacegirl. After she's imprisoned by the evil judge and ruler of the planet, she escapes with the help of a masked accomplice. During her time in her prison cell and as she tries to get off the planet, she discovers a world of exploited creatures, including the giant Leviathan who's being used to power the planet. Some familiar friends, including Mouse, Strong Strong, and One, all make appearances, and Madrigal and Piper are key to Zita's eventual escape.
","Both girls and boys will delight in this surreal story. The Return of Zita the Spacegirl introduces more fantastical creatures, including Raggy (a pile of animate rags) and Femer (a skeleton), and brings back readers' favorites to enliven the complex, weird, and wonderful world of Zita's space adventures. This final book in the Zita trilogy focuses primarily on a conflict between Zita and Joseph, which feels a little more sad than her previous conflicts, where the enemy was more clear-cut. But the story highlights the incredible empathy Zita possesses, as well as the loyalty she builds through her commitment to helping others.
The ending seems to tease of more adventures, which might be a little difficult to explain to kids hoping for a fourth book. Alas, kids will need to continue Zita's adventures in their imaginations, or use author and illustrator Ben Hatke's sketches of early Zita stories in the back of the book as inspiration to create their own comic adventures.","Parents need to know that The Return of Zita the Spacegirl is the third (and last) in the series of graphic novels starring a brave, curious, and kind young heroine. Expect plenty of sci-fi peril throughout, with a few scenes that could be scarier than those in the previous books, including a thwarted execution and the sedation (with needles) of the beloved Mouse character. A key character seems to turn on Zita at one point, which might be upsetting to sensitive kids, but all works out well in the end. There's also one giant kiss between Madrigal and Piper.

Raised in Lynchburg, Virginia, the smart and athletic Leland quickly becomes an excellent student-athlete, encouraged by his supportive parents and extended family. Studying chemistry and working in a lab s an undergraduate, Leland is able to attract enough attention as a wide receiver to get drafted by the Detroit Lions. Knowing that professional football careers are notoriously unstable, Leland wisely chooses to begin engineering graduate school as he conditions, learns playbooks, nd tries to find a way to stick in the league. Sure enough, his brief pro career is over before it starts, cut short by a hamstring injury and a better offer in his chosen field: space exploration. The rest of the book charts his meteoric rise from researcher to robotics engineer to an eventual placement in the astronaut program. After a dramatic injury during deep-sea training causes permanent damage, it's unclear if he will ever be physically cleared to fly. Leland must rely on his faith and his discipline to continue his career as an engineer and educator at NASA, and his hard work pays off when he is eventually assigned to two missions flying to the International Space Station. His star-studded life story sees him crossing paths with space pioneers, pop stars such as Pharrell, Mos Def, and will.i.am, and even both Presidents Bush (junior and senior) nd Obama, eventually leading to minor fame and a job hosting the TV show Child Genius. As an educator and advocate, Leland continues to encourage and contribute to programs in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math), particularly for students of color and around the world who may not know about the opportunities available to become space professionals. ","Leland Melvin's determination, courage, perseverance, and adaptability all shine through in this inspiring account of a remarkable career. Throughout Chasing Space, he constantly makes sure to point out all the opportunities and second chances given to him by various people and institutions that believed in him, stressing the importance of having a positive attitude and always showing your willingness to learn and grow.
With a straightforward writing style featuring fascinating insights into the realities of space travel nd a larger-than-life story that needs no embellishment, Melvin passes on his wisdom to future generations ""to spread the word about possibilities and connections, lighting the path for journeys humanity has yet to take.""

Once Upon a Twice,"Clever, spooky nonsense adventure isn't for sensitive kids.","Written in rhyme interwoven with nonsense words, this is the story of a young adventuresome mouse who learns the hard way just why he should listen to his elders.
","The tone is definitely spooky, the language playfully imaginative, and the illustrations rich, and beautifully magical. Quite a combination! With mice prowling through the rice field, predators lurking in the dark, and words of warning ""whispercrooned,"" tension builds and is carried near to the end. Though this is not really a Halloween story, it definitely exudes that kind of scary suspense. 
The joy of the story is in the wordplay. Rhyming lines are splattered with made-up words that are fun to say and, for the most part, clever in their meaning. The technique is slightly reminiscent of Jabberwocky by Lewis Carroll or The BFG by Roald Dahl, and almost as enjoyable. Set in stanzas against artwork that is amazing in its expressive, uncluttered sensitivity, the story seems like an ancient one, and one readers will want to read time and time again. 
Deep midnight blues, dark grey-greens, blacks of the wooded landscape, flecks of luminous fireflies, and a bright off-white moon provide a rich tapestry for this story. Predators are painted as dark creatures, silhouetted against the moon or nearly hidden in the reeds along the riverbank while light brown mice show up very well, almost as if a spotlight were following them, and making the point that they definitely can be seen...not a good thing. And, except for Jam, the mice have eyes that express their timidity and caution; his shine with adventure.  ","Parents need to know that they should read this book through a couple of times before reading it aloud because the clever nonsense words can be stumbling blocks. Also, this may not be the story to read to sensitive kids who are already afraid of the night or upset about the notion of predators hunting prey. Kids who love wordplay, however, will love it.

She finds friendship and safety with her new roommates, but her presence puts them in danger, too. What power does she have over the horrors that run the town?

","THE NETHERGRIM is something of a standard-issue fantasy novel -- pleasant enough but not offering much in the way of innovation or originality.

Larry and the Meaning of Life,Third installment of series with wild plot twists and turns.,"Josh, also known as Larry, is used to having goals and purpose. The first two books in the series had him running for president and waging a war against rampant consumerism. Now in LARRY AND THE MEANING OF LIFE, Josh finds himself without motivation, sitting on the couch watching reruns, unable to get excited about anything. When his best friend sends him to take a walk at his favorite retreat, he runs into an unlikely guru. Larry is skeptical of Gus and his philosophy, but he doesn't have much else going for him so he decides to give Gus a try. Old friends and enemies pop up at the least expected moments in Josh's journey and the ending is unexpected and shocking.
","Larry and the Meaning of Life can be confusing for those who haven't read the previous books, but there are helpful footnotes Josh provides throughout the novel. Author Janet Tashjian keeps the story moving at a healthy pace and throws in enough plot twists that readers may come out feeling like pretzels. In Josh, Tashjian has a fascinating character with depth, who's smart, engaging, and endearing to her audience.
Readers will find themselves both caught up in the story as it rushes, twists, and turns toward its finish and protective of Josh as he displays distinctive vunerablility. This is a great book for teens who tend to look at the world with more awareness than their peers and it's also for those who are questioning their future and their place in the world.
 ","Parents need to know that the main character gets depressed and seeks guidance from a questionable guru who may be running a cult. Violence includes a teen getting beaten up, land mines planted, and the threat of a possibly murderous stalker. There's talk of a teen hooking up with an adult and a few pictures to prove it.

A Taste for Red,"Creepy, funny vampire mystery is a page-turner.","Svetlana Grimm is a new student at Sunny Hill middle school. Previously homeschooled, she finds herself in 6th grade where the classes are boring and the kids are friendly -- which is unfortunate because she wants to be a loner.

It's always great to see a female protagonist and Svetlana doesn't let us down.","Parents need to know that this vampire read for middle graders is pretty mild for the genre. The violence is gore-free: a kidnapping, an almost-poisoning, someone falls out a window and breaks his arm, and an attempt to kill a vampire.

But when Austin heads off to soccer camp and begins ignoring her texts, Bina doesn't know how to react. She starts to connect with Austin's older sister, but that relationship doesn't feel quite right. With the support of her family and her guitar playing, can she find a way to make the most of her time off from school?
","Summers are supposed to be fun, but this sensitive and heartfelt graphic novel shows the downside of too much free time.

Bina's sensitivity and empathy make her a character worth rooting for, and middle-grade girls will especially enjoy her quest for connection with others.","Parents need to know that Hope Larson's All Summer Long is a stand-alone graphic novel bout a 13-year-old girl trying on new roles during a long, lonely summer.

The Sky Is Everywhere,Mature read has teen finding her way after her sister dies.,"Lennie is extremely close to her older sister, so after Bailey dies, she is a ""shell-less turtle... demented and devastated in equal measure, an unfreakingbelievable mess of a girl."" She misses Bailey terribly, but living without a shell -- and out of her sister's shadow -- opens up new possibilities for her, too. She even begins a complicated romance with a new boy at school, a talented musician who is hiding pain of his own.
","There are probably too many wacky characters and twists in this plot, but Lennie's authentic voice keeps the story grounded. As she struggles both with losing her sister and falling in love for the first time, her narration remains honest and poetic: ""I've always been into the Big bang theory of passion, but as something theoretical... something  that I might secretly want bad but can't imagine ever happening to me"".
She doesn't always head down the right path (after her sister dies, for example, she hooks up with her grief-stricken boyfriend several times, then doesn't come clean to her new love); even then readers will understand her motivations and find it easy to root for her. The little poems and stories she writes and secretly scatters around her town not only fill in some of the narrative, but they give readers a peek into her sensitive soul.","Parents need to know that this is a pretty mature book: Not only are the characters coping with the loss of someone they love, but there is plenty of sexy material as well. Lennie hooks up several times with her dead sister's fiance -- he even puts his hands under her shirt and down her pants. Later, she and Joe kiss on a bed, and talk about having sex. She confesses that she is a virgin, but he is not. The language can be rough, and there is pot smoking and teen drinking. There is a good message in this book about taking control of your own life. At the end, Lennie has to decide what she really wants -- and this means taking her music seriously again, and revealing her most vulnerable feelings to Joe.

"The Book Itch: Freedom, Truth, and Harlem's Greatest Bookstore",Lively tale of store that aided civil rights struggle.,"Lewis Henri Michaux has a book itch. He wants to help people -- especially African-American people -- educate themselves so they can fully understand their civil rights. He believes that reading and getting together to discuss ideas is the way to do it. So, he works, saves, and opens the National Memorial African Bookstore. This bookstore becomes the gathering place for people from all over the world who are committed to the struggle for civil rights. Michaux's bookstore, as seen through the eyes of his young son, brims with big ideas and historic moments.
","Soaring and motivational, this book brings to life the little Harlem bookstore that became a gathering place, a house of ideas, and an agent in the civil rights movement. Author Vaunda Micheaux Nelson does a wonderful job spotlighting an important but lesser known story for children. Combining the punchy and rhythmic catchphrases of bookstore owner Lewis Henri Michaux with the observational commentary of his son Nelson makes the story come alive.
Parents and kids will love the lively dialogue nd R. Gregory Christie's illustrations as well as the appearances of historical and cultural figures, including Muhammad Ali and Malcolm X. The story is a perfect springboard to discuss the kinds of activities people who were part of the civil rights movement were involved in.","Parents need to know The Book Itch: Freedom, Trut, and Harlem's Greatest Bookstore, by Vaunda Micheaux Nelson, offers a child's-eye view of a historic business, opened by the author's great-uncle in the 1930s, that played a key role in the civil rights movement.

"Shadowshaper: The Shadowshaper Cypher, Book 1",Art-filled urban fantasy has outstanding Afro-Latina hero.,"In SHADOWSHAPER, Sierra has just started her summer vacation and decides to spend some of it painting a mural in her Brooklyn neighborhood. Up high on scaffolding with her paintbrushes, she spots something very strange on a mural across the way. It's the rapidly fading picture of a man crying a real tear. And then things just get stranger when Sierra heads home. Her grandfather, Lazaro, generally unable to talk after a stroke, tells her, ""They are coming. For us. For the shadowshapers."" And Sierra needs to find an artist named Robbie whom she knows from school. He will help her. When Sierra heads out for the night with her friends, she finds Robbie and peppers him with questions. Before he can say much about what he knows about shadowshapers, people who can coax friendly spirits into their art, something very unfriendly interrupts them -- a man who looks barely alive, repeating ""Sierra"" in a raspy voice. After Sierra escapes him, she finds out he was a friend of her grandfather's who went missing and is now a walking dead host for spirits who want to hurt Sierra and her family.
","Readers will flock to this book for the outstanding Afro-Latina lead character and stay for the art-infused fantasy storytelling. If you stripped away the shadowshaper spirit part, the story would still fascinate. We follow Sierra to her home, where she faces prejudices from her own family -- sexism from her grandfather and racism from her aunt -- and out with her friends, navigating their gentrifying Brooklyn neighborhood. A scene at a brand-new hipster coffee shop is both full of humor and astute social commentary.
And then there's this whole spirit world accessed through deep cultural connection and art. Sierra slowly discovers her gifts as this world begins to fade. Yet there's more about the immigrant experience to ponder as the body count in Shadowshaper rises and the mystery builds. Sometimes the action falls a bit short of exciting -- you're sure Sierra will jump at the chance to use her cool new powers, and she doesn't think of it until after you're yelling at her through the book, stupidly hoping she'll hear you -- but the heroism wins out in the end. Overall a great start to a unique fantasy series.","Parents need to know that Shadowshaper is author Daniel Jose Older's first book for teens and the first book in this Brooklyn-set fantasy series with a Latina hero named Sierra. There's much here about honoring your heritage, and Sierra, with her confidence, natural hair, and pride in her Puerto Rican roots, gets our highest Role Model rating. Fantasy violence gets a little gross when teens fight dead, possessed bodies. Eye sockets are pushed in and a head is crushed. The teens don't sustain lasting injuries beyond a broken nose. Kissing doesn't last long, and only adult characters drink nd smoke. There's swearing in English and Spanish: ""Ass"" is inserted in conversation a lot, and it doesn't go beyond ""eat s--t,"" uttered in Spanish.

"The Madness Underneath: Shades of London, Book 2",Cool main character holds together 2nd London mystery.,"After confronting evil head-on and barely living to tell the tale, Rory leaves London's Wexford boarding school to recover with her parents in Bristol. But she's restless and can't talk to her therapist about what's really making recovery difficult: She can see ghosts, and not only that, but she has an unheard of power to dispose of them with just one touch thanks to the supernatural way she almost died. It's not long before strings are pulled to bring her back to London and Wexford (thanks to Stephen and his secret ghost-hunting police force that need her skill). But there's no comfortable dorm routine waiting for her. She's unbelievably behind in school work and way too distracted to study when she learns of a mysterious murder down the street, committed right along the crack that exploded open when she was attacked. As Rory begins to uncover what really happened, exams approach -- a reality almost scarier than what madness lies beneath Wexford.
","Topping The Name of the Star was never going to be easy, and uthor Maureen Johnson didn't quite manage it here. Johnson tidied up the gory mystery almost too neatly: Jack the Ripper II, dead and gone for real. But she still had Rory, her hip and hilarious main character. And now she has a special skill as a ghost hunter no one else has. Getting her back to Wexford takes some therapy sessions and too many pages. Getting her on the trail of ghosts again is also slow-going, and once she gets a great lead (old asylum -- cool!) that storyline dries up. And Book 1's constant tension (will the Ripper get Rory?!) is replaced with the looming anxiety of exams Rory will never pass. Not quite the same ... Finally THE MADNESS UNDERNEATH takes on a totally new villain near the end, clearly to keep the series alive.
	While it's too bad the asylum storyline didn't stand on its own, there's still no passing up the Shades of London series. Not with Rory as the main character and all the fascinating and macabre tidbits of London history. And the cliffhanger at the end guarantees that Book 3 will fly off the shelves.","Parents need to know that this review for The Madness Underneath is a big spoiler for the first in the Shades of London mystery series, The Name of the Star, so be warned. Now readers of the gripping first book know about the ghosts Rory sees and a recovery from her encounter with a ghost impersonating Jack the Ripper leaves her scarred in more ways than one. There's less gore in this one, but still some deaths by falling, a bludgeoning, and a car crash. A kidnapping, near-suicide, and mentions of a past overdose round out the violent content. Like Book 1, the rest of the content is pretty mild, with just a little strong language, a little kissing, and some older teen drinking. More fascinating London history crops up as brave Rory discovers her skills as an investigator.

Treasure on Superstition Mountain,Action picks up in adventure-packed sequel.,"After their harrowing adventure in a canyon on Superstition Mountain, the Barker boys -- Henry, Simon, and Jack -- and friend Delilah, who's slowed down by a broken leg, are eager to learn more about the map and gold coins they discovered there. In search of the legendary gold mine, they explore a nearby ghost town, continue their research at the library, and prepare to return to the perilous canyon -- ignoring their parents' order to stay off the mountain. Sneaking back gets easier when the boys' parents go out of town and their visiting Aunt Kathy leaves them alone and goes on a date. They make a thrilling discovery, but at great risk, and still have many unanswered questions.
\ \
 ","The action picks up considerably, but, as in the earlier book, the overall story lacks a satisfying resolution. TREASURE ON SUPERSTITION MOUNTAIN picks up where the first book in the series left off, and it's best read after Missing on Superstition Mountain. Henry in particular develops as a character, showing courage and kindness and becoming the heart of the group.
 Each dramatic scene moves the plot forward only incrementally, and the story seems to halt abruptly. Some of the mysterious characters from the first book don't appear in this installment, but others take a more prominent role. Many questions remain to be resolved in the third book.","Parents need to know that Treasure on Superstition Mountain, the second book in a series, is best enjoyed after the first volume, Missing on Superstition Mountain. The children continue to ignore their parents' rules in pursuit of adventure, this time taking advantage of a relative who shirks her babysitting duties to go on a date instead. The children are repeatedly in gravely perilous situations (including facing down a rattlesnake and barely escaping a rock slide), and a hidden person threatens them.

"The Indigo Spell: Bloodlines, Book 3","Third Bloodlines adventure takes a romantic, magical turn.","At the end of The Golden Lily, Alchemist prodigy Sydney Sage and Moroi vampire Adrian Ivashkov finally gave into their feelings for each other in one climactic kiss. INDIGO SPELL explores the aftermath of the ""monumental kiss"": Sydney knows that a future with Adrian is forbidden, but the more she resists, the more she realizes how much and how often she needs him. Convinced at first that what she feels is lust and not love, Sydney throws herself into investigating Marcus Finch, a rebel ex-Alchemist on the run from the organization. As she deals with the secrets Marcus reveals about the Alchemists, Sydney must also contend with a dangerous witch who might be targeting her.
","Readers patiently waiting for the Sydney and Adrian relationship to finally move forward are duly rewarded with the most romantic installment in the Bloodlines series to date. The charming, artistic Adrian is everpresent in the story, and he perfectly balances Sydney's high-strung, type-A tendencies. That said, Mead's focus on the star-crossed lovers comes at the expense of secondary characters Jill, Angeline, Eddie, and Trey; there's considerably less about them here than in the first two novels, but it's clear they will feature more prominently in upcoming stories.
Although there's action and intrigue -- particularly about the former Alchemists who want to ""break"" the ceremonial tattoo that bonds them to the order -- this book is mostly about Sydney's character development. An Alchemist trained to regard vampires with a healthy dose of revulsion, Sydney knows that her blossoming and at times overwhelming feelings for Adrian go against everything she's been taught -- as does her newfound proficiency with magic. Faced with so many life-altering decisions, Sydney is a compelling protagonist you can't help but root for, even when she's exasperating. Mead is an author who knows how to keep you interested in her universe of characters, and it's already obvious the fourth book will be a game-changer.","Parents need to know that Indigo Spell is the third installment in Richelle Mead's best-selling Bloodlines series. After building up the chemistry between protagonist Sydney Sage and her vampire love interest, Adrian, Mead lets the spark fly, and romance takes the spotlight. There are several passionate kissing scenes and two all-out makeout sessions. The language is pretty mild compared with other teen books, but there are a few instances of ""s--t"" and ""a--hole."" So far, this is the series' least violent novel; there's suspense, action, and a magic-based fight, but no one actually dies. This series continues to explore issues of discrimination, questioning authority, and finding true love.

"Loveboat, Taipei",Taiwanese American teen finds love and freedom in fun tale.,"Eighteen-year-old Ever Wong wants to pursue her passion for dancing after high school at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, but her parents expect her to become a doctor. So when she's forced to attend the Chien Tan program in Taiwan, she believes the cultural and language-immersion program will be as strict as her parents and purely educational. But to her surprise, she finds LOVEBOAT, TAIPEI, where the supervisors look the other way, and the overachievers surrounding her are more interested in sneaking out, hooking up, and breaking the rules. Without her overbearing parents watching her every move, Ever's on a mission to make this summer the best one yet.
","Abigail Hing Wen has created a fun, fast-paced, and dramatic coming-of-age novel about a Taiwanese-American teen who finds love and freedom in an unexpected place. She pulls from her own experience attending the infamous Chien Tan program as inspiration for Ever's story, and her rich, detailed descriptions will transport readers to Taiwan. As in other Asian/Asian American tales, such as American Panda or Frankly in Love, Ever is caught between two cultures and is struggling to please her parents while staying true to herself. And while there are plenty of entertaining moments in Ever's love life, Loveboat, Taipei also delves into some heavy themes, including mental health issues, abusive relationships, and racism. It can be a lot to process at times, but as Ever learns more about herself and begins to embrace her culture, readers will understand how important open, honest communication is in healthy relationships.","Parents need to know that Abigail Hing Wen's Loveboat, Taipei is a fun, fast-paced, and dramatic coming-of-age story that deals with first love, friendship, family, culture, and identity. Readers will learn about Chien Tan, a cultural and language-immersion program attended by teens from around the world, as well as Taiwanese culture, food, and history.

More Happy Than Not,"Gripping, thought-provoking tale of memory, sexual identity.","MORE HAPPY THAN NOT is young Bronx-born author Adam Silvera's debut novel. It's the story of Aaron Soto, a 16-year-old Nuyorican living in the Bronx projects in a near future where people can get memories suppressed by undergoing a revolutionary technique called the Leteo procedure. Aaron has issues: His father recently committed suicide and he himself attempted it; his family lives in a tiny one-bedroom apartment; and his circle of friends on the block isn't always very supportive. Still, Aaron's got his girlfriend Genevieve, a beautiful artist, by his side. When he meets Thomas, a sensitive guy from a neighboring project who shares his love of comic books, superheroes, and classic movies, Aaron slowly begins to question his own sexuality. He knows Genevieve is great, but he's drawn to Thomas in a way that makes him wonder if he's a ""dude liker,"" a dangerous thing to be in his 'hood.
","With its urban setting and diverse characters, More Happy Than Not is a rare and poignant look at how a struggling gay kid from the Bronx deals with pain, grief, and the heartbreak of love. Like his protagonist, Silvera, 25, is gay, Bronx-born, and Puerto Rican (not to mention having the same initials), so there's an authenticity to his prose that isn't always the case with books about low-income, urban characters. Aaron is realistically depicted as a bundle of contradictions: His mother is employed but barely makes a livable wage as a hospital social worker; his friends include petty criminals and aspiring artists, dropouts and ambitious students. The sadness stemming from his father's suicide and his own attempt permeates everything Aaron does. Even his romantic relationship is somewhat based on gratitude to the one girl who stuck by his side while everyone else (even his crew) distanced themselves.
Aaron's story shifts into high gear once he starts hanging out with Thomas, who's sensitive, articulate, smart, and loves Steven Spielberg movies, comic books, and all the pop culture-touchstones that make for a believably fast fanboy friendship. Thomas doesn't act tough or keep himself separate like Brendan, Fat Dave, Skinny Dave, and Me-Crazy (the guys Aaron has known all his life). While Genevieve is away at art camp, Aaron begins to think about Thomas so often he questions whether he's straight, bi, or gay. If he's really gay, Aaron wonders if the Leteo procedure would be a way to ""fix"" him. Silvera explores the way the true you always comes through, even when you want to suppress that part of yourself. His writing explores the humor and heartache, the sense of hopelessness that can surround a kid in Aaron's circumstances. More Happy Than Not, as the title implies, is about a fragile boy finding a way through the darkness and into the light, where everything isn't sunshine and light but where happiness seems possible no matter whom you love or who loves you back.","Parents need to know that More Happy Than Not is a science-fiction story set in the near future, where people can pay to have painful or traumatic memories suppressed. As in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the procedure can be used to block everything from the violent death of a loved one, an ugly breakup, or even same-sex attraction. The protagonist lives in the Bronx with a diverse group of characters, and frequently their conversations are peppered with strong language (""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" coarse words for body parts, ""a--hole,"" etc.) and references to sexual activity and experience (tales of various first times, illicit hookups straight and gay, and teen pregnancy as well as protection). Despite the heavy themes and serious plot points, author Adam Silvera's debut book conveys a hopeful message about happiness, acceptance, and love.

The Other Girl: A Midvale Academy Novel,"Fun prep school story, but full of racy content.","This is a follow-up to Miller'sInside the Mind of Gideon Rayburn. But this time, instead of seeing and hearing everything that her boyfriend has to say, Molly finds herself alternately in the mind of super beautiful Pilar Binitez-Jones -- a girl whom Gideon (and every other boy at school) has a crush on. This leads to some majorly soul-crushing moments, like at an academic competition when Pilar thinks about Gideon: ""If we win tonight... I will sleep with him, and I will totally try to stay with him too."" But eventually, though her ESP, Molly is able to make some smart insights about the insecurities everyone has deep inside -- and how to be happy anyway.
","Readers shouldn't expect to really be challenged here, but as far as fun, fluffy, prep school books are concerned, this one is pretty well done. The cast of characters may be somewhat predictable -- Molly is smart but insecure, Gideon is sweet and clueless, while pretty Pilar's perfection comes at a price -- but the ESP angle is a fun device and leads to some hilarious moments (such as when Molly calls the Fred Segal store to warn them that Pilar has been trying on bathing suits without her underwear). The sweet underlying message about being true to yourself (instead of trying to be exactly what your boyfriend wants) will even leave readers feeling good about devouring this literary junk food.","Parents need to know that this book features all kinds of racy material, from the main character planning to have sex with her boyfriend in the school's chapel to a scene where an underage girl makes out with a creepy dean as part of an elaborate scheme. There is swearing, drug use, and sex among the teens at Midvale Prep -- and the prettiest girl at school  pretty much starves herself in an effort to look thinner.

Hour of the Bees,Tween finds herself and her roots in gripping magical tale.,"Twelve-year-old Carol lives in suburban Albuquerque and is looking forward to a summer of hanging out with her friends before they all start middle school. But that's not what happens -- instead, her whole family heads for the middle of nowhere to a barren ranch owned by the grandfather she's never met. His health is failing, he's suffering from dementia, and her dad has hired a lawyer to have the old man declared incompetent so he can be put in assisted living and the ranch sold off.  Armed with chirpy brochures from the assisted living facility, the family is determined to keep Grandpa Serge calm as they prepare the place for sale. Charged with keeping the old man out of trouble, Carol is startled when he tells her not to spit on her roots, and she quickly becomes fascinated with his stories about two century-old kids named Sergio and Rosa, a magic tree that used to live in the land, the lake that used to be there, and the bees who stole it away drop by drop. Everybody thinks it's just crazy talk when the old man calls Carol by her long-dead grandmother Rosa's name and raves about bees coming back and ending the hundred-year drought. But then, everywhere Carol goes, there are bees where none have been seen for decades.
","First-time author Lindsay Eagar's heartfelt, gripping, original novel finds its relatable, 12-year-old heroine connecting with long-lost family nd centuries-old magic in rural New Mexico. HOUR OF THE BEES takes its young narrator and readers on a life-altering journey, as a summer on her dementia-stricken grandfather's arid sheep ranch puts her in touch with roots she didn't know she had and makes her see things from a new perspective:
""I'm surprised, too -- this sounds nothing like me. Caring about my roots? Worrying about what will happen to this ranch, this land? But try as I may to push this frustration away, my eyes sting with tears.
""I hide my face with a glance out the window. Dad and Mr. González are still pacing the pasture. Are they debating how much this ranch is worth? Probably not much to the rest of the world -- not much in dollars -- but it's Serge's home. The place where sheep tell time.""","Parents need to know that Lindsay Eagar's luminous debut, Hour of the Bees, intertwines the story of a magical tree and the people it sustained with the tale of a life-changing summer for 12-year-old Carol, who has issues of her own (""I don't want to be Mexican. Or American. Or Mexican-American. Or Caro-leeen-a. Just being Carol is hard enough""). There are plenty of heavy subjects, from the drought that's laid waste to the land to the deep rifts within families. A character is forcibly removed from his home ""for his own good,"" and much of Carol's internal conflict comes from her growing sense of wrongness about this. People and animals, some beloved, die, and readers may want to keep a box of tissues handy for some scenes. There's a bit of mild language (""poo,"" ""pissed,"" ""crap,"" ""sucks""), and in a desperate-times-call-for-desperate-measures scene, a tween character steals a car. But overall, the captivating narrative voice and the strong messages of love, family, courage, and not spitting on your roots carry the day.

Gradually he discovers that he is from 1000 years in the future, when the earth is an ecological wasteland; that the Turning Point, beyond which the disaster can't be stopped, is coming up; and that he has been sent back according to a prophecy to find something called Firestorm, which can stop the coming catastrophe. If only he knew what it was, or where.
","The story rockets along with pulse-pounding action and gritty violence, and even reluctant teen readers will be quickly sucked in. And then in the second half, after they can't possibly put the book down, they get a good-sized dose of ecological information and messages. Jack is a likable enough protagonist, and his gradually emerging abilities are satisfying, and the story features time travel (a sort of Terminator for the teen set), a ninja babe who teaches Jack to fight (after beating him up repeatedly), paranormal abilities, and a climax worthy of a Bond movie. What's not to like? Well, there is internal inconsistency, and some might be bothered by Klass's irritating writing style. Mostly though, readers will be clamoring to find out what happens next.","Parents need to know that this is a futuristic fantasy novel, but there is some gritty violence here (the  teen main character is held down to have his pinky finger cut off with a knife for example, and there's lots of fighting, both with and without weapons, and injuries and deaths). Also expect some sexual references, though nothing explicit beyond kissing. Some teens may also be disturbed by the graphic description of deep water reef trawling. But even reluctant teen readers will be quickly sucked in to all the action here -- and this book could be used to talk about a wide range of topics, including dystopian novels, fantasy violence, ecological issues, etc.

"The Founding Fathers!: Those Horse-Ridin', Fiddle-Playin', Book-Readin', Gun-Totin' Gentlemen Who Started America",History this lively should be required reading in school.,"THE FOUNDING FATHERS offers lively portraits of the 14 most famous founding fathers, who helped form the United States of America: the ""Varsity Squad"" made up of George Washington, Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, James Madison, John Jay, and Alexander Hamilton; and the ""Junior Varsity Squad"" made up of Samuel Adams, John Hancock, Patrick Henry, Gouverneur Morris, John Marshall, Benjamin Rush, and Thomas Paine. The two-page spread on each man offers a full-page ink-and-watercolor drawing on the left, with each man's nickname (such as ""John Adams: His Rotundity"") nd, on the opposite page, a concise profile with a few of each man's famous quotes, s well as a set of stats (height, weight, wealth, education, hobbies, achievements, religious faith, position on slavery, and more) noted in musing ways. There's more explanatory material about the issues they debated at the back, as well as a valuable list of resources for further study. ","This is a highly entertaining information fest written in lively, conversational, slang-dotted prose that makes for both fun and provocative reading. (A great example would be Alexander Hamilton's ""Stance on France: Not a fan."") The details of their lives are charming and quirky nd will surprise readers who imagine the founders as a solid block of devout, practicing Christians (many were not) who had only the highest ideals and were above reproach. These profiles make clear that these were exceptionally intelligent visionaries but also were flawed men and sometimes hypocritical thinkers who squabbled over taxes, central government vs. states' rights, foreign wars, religion, and slavery as they hammered out our representative democracy. Barry Britt's ink-and-watercolor illustrations add humor in each emblematic full-page caricature -- Alexander Hamilton, known for fighting for a constitution (some folks were against having one), is pictured wearing boxing gloves as he holds quill and paper, with steam coming out of his ears; John Adams, known to sob a lot, is shown with a box of tissues, dabbing a tear from his eye -- as does spot art accompanying the list of stats, portraying, for example, Ben Franklin, who lived in France for many years, wearing a beret and carrying a baguette. This book would be wonderful for reading alone or in school nd will delight kids well beyond the usual picture-book age. ","Parents need to know that The Founding Fathers: Those Horse-Ridin', Fiddle-Playin', Book-Readin', Gun-Totin' Gentlemen Who Started America​, by Jonah Winter and illustrated by Barry Blitt, is a rollicking look at 14 of the men who came together to form a more perfect union -- starting with the Continental Congress, the Declaration of Independence, nd the Constitution and Bill of Rights. There's talk of the men's Revolutionary War nd military service, where they stood on the Boston Tea Party and slavery (many opposed it yet owned or kept slaves), and lots more. A great choice for reading alone or aloud, at home or in school, it's  picture book with enormous appeal for kids well past the picture-book stage.

The Penderwicks at Point Mouette,Old-fashioned charmer will appeal to the whole family.,"The Penderwick sisters (minus eldest Rosalind) set off for a summer vacation to the beautiful Maine coast with their favorite Aunt Claire and best friend Jeffrey.

Mr. Bear Says I Love You,Comforting illustrations and sweet verse.,"The title character and his child explore the world around them, complete with ""bugs and slugs and butterflies,"" in this lullaby of a board book. The comforting illustrations and sweet verse make this a favorite among little ones. What's more, older siblings may read along with the rhyming words.
 ","One word describes MR. BEAR SAYS I LOVE YOU: comforting. The illustrations, coupled with musical language, pull little ones into the simple story as Mr. Bear and his cub meet and greet the creatures around them. Tots will recognize such familiar creatures as ladybugs, grasshoppers, ducks, and owls. But best of all, the book ends with cuddles from father to child, professing absolute love.

The Big Wet Balloon,Gentle cartoon vignettes tell cozy sister story.,"Older sister Matilda wants little sister Clemmie to come out and play with her on a happily unstructured Saturday, but the weather isn't cooperating. It's pouring outside, so Clemmie hangs back. When Matilda outfits her sister in rain gear and shows her how to stomp through puddles, Clemmie gets the hang of rainy-day fun. The fun ends abruptly when Matilda decides to release their balloon into the sky, but then she thoughtfully hangs a bunch of colorful new balloons on Clemmie's crib.
","The sisters' relationship in THE BIG WET BALLOON is touchingly and realistically drawn. Clemmie is convincingly young; she doesn't have the language skills to distinguish ""boots"" from ""balloon"" and has no clue how to open an umbrella. However, Matilda clearly enjoys modeling the language Clemmie needs to understand what's going on and also actively shows her how to do things. The characters have a close and loving sibling relationship. While siblings may not feel so loving every minute of the day, this book celebrates their bond.
The Big Wet Balloon is a class act. Toon Books, dedicated to publishing comics-style books for easy reading levels, is headed by Françoise Mouly, art editor of The New Yorker, so the level of art and artistry is high.","Parents need to know that The Big Wet Balloon is a sweet and tender sister story by Argentine cartoonist Liniers.

Five Feet Apart,Sweet love story of sick teens who aren't allowed to touch.,"FIVE FEET APART is about two teens with cystic fibrosis (CF) dealing with first love and the uncertainty of their futures. Stella's an organized achiever who has her life in order and manages her medications and treatments efficiently. Will's the total opposite. He's a rule breaker tired of medications, hospitalizations, and drug trials for B. cepacia, the bacteria he's contracted that's complicating his CF. When Stella and Will first meet on the CF ward, they infuriate each other, but in true opposites-attract fashion, romance eventually blooms. The bacteria infecting Will is easily transmitted and drug resistant, and it drastically shortens the already short life span of CF patients. Because of these factors, he has to stay six feet away from the other patients on the ward. This is especially important for Stella, as she is waiting for a lung transplant. As the two teens work through the physical barriers to a relationship, they're also working through emotional barriers: the ones that keep them from enjoying normal teen life and activities. They grapple with tough decisions and the way their illnesses have had an impact on their families. Balancing the desire to live a carefree life with the responsibility of taking care of themselves presents an ongoing and difficult battle. They hope to fight together, but they might not get to make that call.
","In this bittersweet romance, two teens struggling with cystic fibrosis find love where they least expect to: the hospital. Five Feet Apart starts out on the formulaic side. Stella's a straight arrow who's super organized and into coding, while Will's a rule-breaking artist. Their verbal sparring early in the book sounds forced, but as the story progresses, the banter becomes more engaging and the characters gain more depth. Stella and Will have serious emotional struggles because of their disease and their family issues. As they get to know each other, they grow emotionally and add a needed balance to each other's life. It's enjoyable to see the characters give each other important emotional gifts.
The story is told in alternating points of view, and that approach works well here. Will's and Stella's voices are different enough that changing narrators each chapter isn't confusing, nd there's little overlapping of action between chapters, so the story doesn't get bogged down. One glaring error to note, though: A nurse reveals a patient's diagnosis to another patient. That's against the law. Also, the kids seem to have the run of the hospital, which pushes believability pretty far.","Parents need to know that Five Feet Apart is about a budding romance between two teens in treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disease affecting the lungs and leading to severely shortened life expectancy. Though the book is essentially a romance, larger issues of how serious illnesses affect families and the different ways patients deal with CF are important parts of the story. The content is fairly tame, in that there's no smoking, drinking, or drug use. Characters swear a little (""ass,"" ""s--t,"" ""f---ing"") but not frequently. Romance and attraction figure largely into the story. Characters talk about sex and engage in sexy, flirtatious behavior in a few scenes, but nothing sexually graphic happens.

Landscape with Invisible Hand,"Darkly funny sci-fi shows future with aliens, economic woes.","Set in the wake of an alien invasion, LANDSCAPE WITH INVISIBLE HAND follows teen artist Adam Costello as he and his family adjust to a broken economy. Thanks to the job-destroying technology of the extraterrestrial vuvv, Adam and his mother and sister have little money for food, water, or medicine. Because the aliens are fascinated by human inventions such as ""true love,"" Adam and his neighbor Cleo pretend to be romantically involved and allow their actions to be recorded in a pay-per-view arrangement. The pressure of pleasing their alien overlords takes its toll, and Adam finds himself heading for a crisis of artistic integrity and gastric distress.
","Darkly funny and politically insightful, this satirical sci-fi novel takes a unique look at the consequences of alien contact. Landscape with Invisible Hand pits  young painter against the artistic preferences of conquering extraterrestrials. It's not action-packed, but the book's narrative urgency comes from how relatable Adam's predicament is.

The Leaving,Fast-paced thriller seeks to solve mystery of missing teen.,"Five teenagers return to their hometown 11 years after they mysteriously disappeared. They have no memory of who took them, where they’ve been, or even if they've been together during those years. Most unsettling, none of them has any memory of Matt, the sixth child presumed kidnapped with the five. They return to families changed and sometimes broken, and while some seem content to settle into their former lives and identities, two are determined to solve the mystery of their kidnapping. The story unfolds with one tantalizing clue after another -- the discovery of a cult novel whose plot mirrors their disappearance and captivity, notes suggesting Matt may still be alive, recovered memories that hint at a past romantic relationship between Lucas and Scarlett. And why did everyone dismiss a possible link between the disappearance and a school shooting?
","This abduction mystery relies on a fast-paced plot filled with twists and turns rather than the all-too-common storyline of teens being sexually abused by their kidnapper. Interwoven in the story is a provocative question: Who are we without our memories?
While the resolution of the mystery and identity of the kidnapper are believable, packing all this into a two-week time line is a stretch, although it's one not likely to bother readers caught up in the story. ","Parents need to know that Tara Altebrando's The Leaving is the story of six kindergartners who vanished without a trace, leaving no clues as to who might haven taken them. Eleven years later, five of them return home with no memory of where they’ve been or what happened to the sixth child who went missing that same day. As the five begin to recover fragments of memory, two of them set out to solve the mystery of their kidnapping. Taking place over the span of 15 days and narrated in alternating chapters by returnees Lucas and Scarlett and Avery, the sister of the missing child, it’s a fast-paced thriller, full of unexpected plot twists. There's some violence --  man is found murdered, a man falls down steps and dies, and there's a school shooting and references to the original kidnapping -- but none of these incidents is described in graphic detail. Sexual content is limited to  few kisses.

"Eldest: The Inheritance Cycle, Book 2",The epic saga continues -- and improves.,"Eldest picks up where Eragon left off, at the end of the battle between the Varden, aided by Eragon, Saphira, and their friends, and the evil emperor Galbatorix's forces in Farthen Dûr. With barely time to mourn his fallen friends Eragon is first caught up in political intrigue among the humans, and between the humans, elves, and dwarves, and then sent across the empire to complete his training as a Rider with the elves in the vast forest of Du Weldenvarden.
At the same time, Eragon's cousin Roran is sought by Galbatorix, who sends soldiers and two of the vicious Ra'zac to Carvahall, Eragon's home. Roran leads the villagers in holding them off, but Roran's fiancé is captured and the villagers are force to flee across the mountains, pursued all the way, to try to make their way by land and sea to Surda, the stronghold of the rebels.
As the story flips back and forth between Eragon and Roran we get to see both of them grow in maturity and power, Eragon as a result of his training with the last survivor of the old Riders, and Roran in a trial by fire as the de facto leader of his villagers fighting their way across the empire. These parallel streams, of course, converge in a climactic battle which once again ends the book.
Includes map and language guide.
","ELDEST is considerably longer and more dense than its predecessor, Eragon, but it's exciting, dark, suspenseful, and imaginative. This is a considerable step forward in Christopher Paolini's development as a writer. Eragon and Roran are compelling characters, and the relationship between Eragon and Saphira can be touching.
It may take some of the younger fans quite a bit of plowing through to finish it, but Paolini's writing is, like his main character, growing more fluid and sure here, with almost none of the embarrassing clunkers that marred the first book. His dialogue, though still the stilted, formal speech beloved by authors of high fantasy, is less hackneyed and clichéd. This is the work of a growing young writer who is learning as he goes and gradually but surely getting a firmer grip on his considerable talent, like an inexperienced charioteer with a frisky team.","Parents need to know that, as is typical in high fantasy, there is plenty of fighting and bloodshed, though not as much as in the first book. Fighting and war, though sometimes bemoaned, are pretty much accepted as the way to solve problems.

Beautiful,Good-girl-goes-bad tale packed with adult content.,"Cassie is 13 years old, and on her first day at a new school she wants to leave her boring old life behind. New friends quickly introduce her to drugs and alcohol, and she tries acid and loses her virginity in just a few days. At first she is shocked by her new best friend's life: her mother is a drunk and abusive, her father hung himself. A half-sister, Sarah, moves in with Alex's family because her father raped her. Cassie herself has no problem hiding her drug use and drinking from her alcoholic mother and often absent father. Cassie is drawn to a girl named Sarah in a romantic and tender way; Sarah is passive, vulnerable, and scarred. Sarah may be Cassie's way out of her self-destructive cycle, but not in the way she expects.
","This book has been compared to Go Ask Alice, one of the first novels to graphically describe a teen's life on drugs, but BEAUTIFUL is more shocking. It's about young teens abusing all kinds of drugs under the nose of neglectful parents who range from poor to affluent, with no apparent lessons learned. The main character is smart, pretty, and middle class. It's never clear what her motivations are for choosing a dangerous lifestyle other than a desire to be ""beautiful."" It's hard to say what teens are supposed to take away from this book; without consequences for such self-destructive behavior this is simply a voyeuristic look into the lives of some of the other characters who do suffer great abuse. Consequently Cassie's story remains blurred.
But writer Amy Reed has style, even when her prose sounds too sophisticated and articulate for a young teen, particularly one who is disturbed. The authentic narrative voice almost never slips, and may make a story about a 13-year-old still appeal to older teens ready for a very edgy read.","Parents need to know that this is a stark and gritty story of a middle class 13-year-old girl who moves to a new school and chooses to stop being a good girl; to lose her virginity as quickly as possible and embrace drugs and alcohol. Her father is emotionally abusive and her mother is alcoholic and neglectful. She repeatedly has consequence- and protection-free sex with her boyfriend. She abuses drugs (acid, pot, and more) and alcohol without consequences. Her friend (with a horribly dysfunctional family) beats her up. A romantic relationship with another girl develops -- the most tender part of the book. There is one tragic death, but it's not enough to really turn this into a cautionary tale -- just a bleak one filled with every kind of very mature content.

This Is Baby,Lively lesson in naming body parts -- human and animal.,"This cute book begins with statement: ""THIS IS BABY."" Then soon there's a question: ""What are the parts of BABY?"" Then an unseen narrator (presumably a parent or caregiver) says, ""Well, I'll tell you EVERYTHING."" What follows is a rundown of a number of key parts i pages that feature  diverse group of babies, one or two per page, who point to their eyes, nose, fingers, legs, etc. with the help pf animal playmates. ""This is your HEAD,"" says a bird sitting on a baby's bald noggin. ""This is your HAIR,"" says a lion with a big mane on the facing page. And so on, until the bang-up warmhearted  ending: ""There are so many parts of BABY. These are just the things we see. But the biggest part of BABY is the LOVE you get from ME.""
","This simple, rhyming lesson in naming body parts is made more fun and engaging by pairing each baby with an animal. This Is Baby drives the point home when, for example, a rhino's big horn faces baby's' nose, or an octopus is giving baby a super-hug with its many arms. The combo of images may make the words easier for tots to remember. And silly moments -- like tuning the baby over to spotlight his bottom -- keep things light.

For Every One,"Bold, blunt encouragement for dreamers pulls no punches.","FOR EVERY ONE begins with Jason Reynolds' frank admission: ""I got no answers."" Addressing ""Dear Dreamer,"" he begins by explaining that he's writing ""from the inside,"" in the midst of uncertainty and not knowing how his story might turn out. The advice of experts proved useless, and he found no easy tricks for ""making it"" -- but he did realize that ""making it"" might not matter much. He did learn how it feels to struggle, despair, hope, and doubt. And he learned that he's far from alone. It takes faith to jump anyway, despite fear and uncertainty -- and support and understanding can help dreamers find the courage to make that leap.
","Kids hear lots of sunny platitudes about believing in their dreams, but Jason Reynolds gets honest in his book-length poem: Chasing dreams can be hard, lonely, confusing, infuriating -- and worth it. He describes For Every One as a letter he began writing years ago for himself, riddled with self-doubt and frustration. Now a successful author, Reynolds (As Brave As You) still isn't convinced he's ""made it,"" but he's learned that feeling the passion is more important than the destination.
Reynolds writes vividly, using rich similes to describe his dream as a rabid beast that infected him in one section, and in another comparing it to a colicky baby: ""Sometimes I think/ it needs to be changed./ Usually it just/ needs to be fed./ So I feed it everything/ I have./ And/ it feeds me everything/ I have."" He may not have easy answers, but he has generous compassion fellow travelers will treasure.","Parents need to know that For Every One is a stirring free-verse book by Jason Reynolds (The Boy in the Black Suit) about the frustration and rewards of pursuing your passion. Reynolds, who originally presented the poem at the 2011 opening of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, writes frankly about his own self-doubt and pain as he became a successful writer. He rejects any notion that he has advice or tips to share, and discourages readers from getting too caught up in realizing their dreams. Instead, Reynolds notes that the struggle itself is enriching, and offers compassion, empathy, and words he hopes might provide comfort and encouragement. As lonely as the road can seem, he offers reassurance that plenty of dreamers are following the same path.

Not the End of the World,Horrifyingly realistic portrayal of ark for teens.,"The voyage of Noah's Ark is related by the inhabitants, both human and animal, but primarily by Timna, an imaginary daughter of Noah. The story begins with the rains, and soon a giant wave sweeps over the earth. But not everyone drowns right away, and Ham and Shem must spend their time beating survivors away from the ship, an act that troubles Timna and her younger brother, Japheth.
Before they leave the family kidnaps Zilla to be a wife to 12-year-old Japheth, neither of whom are happy about it. So when they find a young boy and his infant sister clinging to the stern of the ship, saving them seems the only thing they can do to rebel against the horrific godliness of the rest of the family. But keeping them secret among the animals in the bowels of the ship becomes more and more difficult, as both humans and animals become increasingly sick in mind and body during their lengthy confinement.
","This is not your children's Bible stories. Our predominant cultural images of the Noah's ark story have always been of the gentle lions with the adorable lambs, all in pairs, on a clean ship with good people for a miraculous journey. But author Geraldine McCaughrean brings it to life as a real horror show. Until the end, this story is one of unrelenting horror and degradation of mind, body, and spirit, and the author pulls no punches.
The fetid mountains of dung, the fleas and lice and mice (none of which are just a pair for long), the noise and filth and especially smell -- all are rendered vividly. But McCaughrean goes far beyond this undeniably realistic picture to examine the psychological toll exacted upon the younger human passengers, forced to see the deaths of dozens and know that millions more have died. This is a tough read, and not for the squeamish, but could push teen readers to think more deeply about familiar Bible stories.","Parents need to know that this is an unrelentingly horrific portrayal of what it might have been like on the ark: many bodies, brutal behavior. The author raises complex issues of morality and faith, and provides no answers. Those with strong religious beliefs may find the portrait of Noah and his family as fanatics bordering on lunatics offensive.

Worse, her grandmother's going back to North Carolina, and it soon turns out that the smart, independent Prairie has to go to regular school for the first time in her life. But there are upsides, starting with the chickens she decides to raise, who become a never-ending source of entertainment, especially when she brings one of them to Show and Tell. Also, for the first time in her life, she has a best friend, which brings both new happiness and new problems to solve.

As the story unfolds, she, Ivy, and the various adults all learn about dealing with the past, living in the present, and looking toward a brighter future.","Parents need to know that there's little to worry about in Prairie Evers, a gem of a novel with a fresh perspective, interesting characters (humans and chickens), and appealing messages of family love, friendship, and seeing things from other people's point of view. Thanks to the strong foundation she's had from her beloved grandmother and her understanding parents, 10-year-old Prairie is both a true original and a good person -- even her missteps with those she loves come from good intentions. A violent incident in the past, in which a classmate's mother killed the girl's father in a drunken fight, leaves scars on the survivors; two baby chicks don't survive their first few days on the farm, though the others grow up strong and healthy.

Monstrumologist,Gruesomely good gothic horror too violent for younger teens.,"An old man reveals a childhood spent in the late 19th century as an apprentice to a monstrumologist -- a doctor who studied monsters. When a graverobber brings them the body of a young woman wrapped in the corpse of a headless monster, the doctor aborts the monster fetus from her and kills it. The race begins to find and kill any surviving members of the monsters called Anthropophagy. Will has grown up aiding with abominable experiments and dissections, but these creatures could not have been created by even the evilest minds. A hunt reveals that some evil man did import them to the U.S., and now more evil men appear to help hunt them -- some of them both evil and mad. At one point even Will becomes monster bait.
","This is shocking, graphically gory pus-and-guts splattered all over an action-packed story with some human moments. The gore and violence are so over the top that it's hard for anyone even the least bit squeamish to look past it. However Yancey is a popular young adult author and this book will have most mature horror fans riveted.
Female horror fans especially may be put off the book's very misogynistic nature. A story with this much imagination could certainly have avoided this -- the 1888 setting is no excuse.","Parents need to know that this Printz Honor winner is a horror story is set in 1888, and despite its fictional aspects,  it remains true to the sexism of the times, and borders on misogyny. Although the Anthropophagy race of monsters will consume any human, here prostitutes are used as bait, and there are stories told of foreign lands where priests fed the monsters young, virginal girls. There are virtually no other female characters in the book. The violence in Monstrumologist is horrific, mature, and gruesomely graphic, making best for older teens.

"The Fall: The Seventh Tower, Book 1","First book in action-packed, inventive series.","Thirteen-year-old Tal has lived his entire life in the enormous, labyrinthine Castle of the Chosen, which is in a state of perpetual darkness due to the Veil that hangs above its seven towers. Inside the Castle, society is sharply delineated by class; the Chosen, like Tal, have magical Sunstones and living shadows, while their servants, the Underfolk, have only \""natural\"" shadows and aren't allowed to have Sunstones. When Tal's father disappears, he tries to steal a larger Sunstone to help his family -- only to wind up stranded outside the Castle when things go awry. Desperate to return home, he first must survive in a wider world he never knew existed.
","As evidenced in his other series Garth Nix is an inventive writer who knows how to spin an engrossing, imaginative story, and THE FALL is no exception. Some elements of the tale are familiar -- a boy on the brink of manhood who must undergo many trials to triumph against his enemies; a reluctant helper who turns out to be a powerful ally; etc. -- but the details are refreshingly original. The world of the Chosen is meticulous and rich; their companion Spiritshadows and shadowguards are particularly appealing (if you've read any of His Dark Materials, you may find Tal's shadowguard reminding you of a daemon).
Tal is also an accessible, relatable character. He makes mistakes and deals with the consequences, and he's not always a happy camper. Though he begins the book very sure of his status and place in the world, as his eyes are opened to new possibilities, he realizes that he has a lot left to learn. Kids who enjoy this first volume of his adventures should jump right into the rest of the books in this series; the story gets even better as Tal finds out more about the truth behind the Castle, the Dark World, and the Veil.","Parents need to know that this is an action-packed story with plenty of peril and scary situations. Tal is almost always in danger, and his world is full of enemies, threatening creatures, and complicated relationships. That said, it's not really any more intense than anything kids will find in the early Harry Potter books. Tal doesn't always do or say the right thing, but his intentions are good, and he learns from his mistakes.

The Last of the High Kings,Sequel wanders but ultimately satisfies.,"In this sequel to The New Policeman, J.J. is now grown, a successful musician with a family of his own. But his daughter, Jenny, has taken to wandering the countryside all day, at the expense of family and school. And, unbeknownst to him, Jenny, whose heritage J.J. knows but the reader doesn't until well into the book, is being manipulated by a Puka into befriending a ghost that guards an ancient beacon. But the Puka, a magical creature that appears as a goat, has reasons of his own for fostering that friendship -- reasons that will have dire consequences for human beings. Includes Glossary and Bibliography.
","After a terrific opening sequence, the first half of this book wanders, just like Jenny. And, like Jenny, it can be fairly irritating. Until the fairytale elements kick in, J.J.'s family just reads as extremely dysfunctional, with a little brother who's supposed to be in his terrible twos but who seems more like an autistic child; J.J. and his wife, who have little consideration for, or understanding of, each other or their children, but who indulge those children to the point where a reader might wonder when Child Protection will be called; and Jenny, who seems to have serious psychological problems of her own.
	In the second half, though, the story settles down, the characters become more understandable, and the plot becomes exciting and suspenseful. Author Kate Thompson tops it all off with an immensely satisfying ending that brings together elements from throughout the book with perfect timing. Rooted in Irish myth, and possessed of a strange, otherworldly feeling even when in our own world, this novel rewards those who persevere through to the end.
 From the Book:
	As J.J. crossed the field called Molly's Place, he felt his annoyance subsiding. More than that, he found he could almost sympathize with Jenny. Although it was midwinter, the weather was mild. A gentle breeze blew a soft, misty drizzle in from the sea, and the gray hills that rose ahead of him were inviting. Why would anyone want to squeeze into a crowded car and be stuck there for three hours when she could stride off into the fresh, earth-scented wilds beyond the farm?
	He spotted something in the grass and changed his course. One of Jenny's shoes. It meant he was on the right track at least. He looked up and caught a glimpse of something white on the mountainside far ahead. That big old goat again. It had been hanging around a lot lately, and it made J.J. uneasy. He suspected that it might not be quite what it appeared to be. He suspected as well that Jenny was already a long, long way ahead. She hadn't got that much of a head start, he was fairly sure, but she was capable of moving incredibly quickly once she had, as she always did, jettisoned her shoes.","Parents need to know that there is little to be concerned with here: a reference to a boy being killed in the distant past, not described, and another to ""smooching.""

Anatole (50th Anniversary Edition),Well-aged tale of an epicurean mouse.,"When the French mouse, Anatole, realizes that humans dislike mice for sneaking in and rummaging around their homes for leftovers, he is adamant about finding a more honorable way to provide for his family. He comes up with an ingenuous plan for helping the Duvall Cheese Factory in exchange for cheese bits he can bring home.
When his plan succeeds, he becomes a \""respectable business-mouse,\"" \""first vice-president in charge of cheese tasting,\"" \""a mouse of honor,\"" and a hero to the humans as well as to the mouse community. Viva Anatole!
","Written by the award-winning Eve Titus and illustrated by Paul Galdone, this is a magnificent book on every level. The story is heartwarming and important, the characters sympathetic, and the illustrations engaging. ANATOLE is about honor and one anthropomorphic mouse's search for self-respect. The story is simply told, but scattered with clever touches that make it uniquely genuine. Especially fun are the names of the children, the list of cheeses, and the playful insertion of French phrases that tickle the tongue.
Galdone's simple, vivid illustrations add richness that draws the reader into Anatole's world. His minimal use of color complements the unpretentious lines of his drawings, especially the features of the mice, with their rounded black eyes and delicate faces. Pages alternate between black and white sketches and those tinted with red, blue, and white of the French flag. The first of 10 Anatole adventures, Anatole was originally published in 1956 and won the Caldecott Honor award.","Parents need to know that this reprint of a popular classic of the '50s is refreshingly true to the original. However, though this is a picture book with captivating illustrations, younger readers may not fully understand the story; older kids and adults will embrace the drawings, story, and message.

Paint the Wind,Horse tale shines with rich plot and characters.,"Life hasn't been easy for 11-year-old Maya -- orphaned at 5, she lives in a tawny California mansion with her overbearing grandmother who detested Maya's horse-loving mother. But a tragic event changes everything. Maya is whisked off to Wyoming to live with her mother's relatives, whom she's never met and, due to her grandmother's lies, she actually fears. 
\
\
Maya struggles to adapt to her new family and living in a rustic camp, but her love of horses -- the strongest connection she has with her mother -- makes living in a teepee and dealing with her bratty cousin a little easier. Maya learns to ride and slowly comes out of her shell, embarking on a journey of self-discovery that leads her to a beautiful, wild horse named Artemisia. With Artemisia by her side, Maya will face the unfathomable.
","Award-winning author Pam Muñoz Ryan paints vivid images of wild horses and western landscapes in this tale about a young girl who must adapt to a brand-new life. It's hard to imagine any horse-loving child disliking this satisfyingly complete story, and the rich plot and character development are likely to captivate young readers who aren't horse-obsessed, too.
The main character's story is interspersed with segments written from the perspective of the wild horse, Artemisia, and Ryan's thorough research on the region and wild horses is evident. Ryan is a masterful writer who deftly handles dialogue, detailed descriptions, action scenes, and plot and character development, and she's achieved another winner in PAINT THE WIND.","Parents need to know that this book has some intense scenes that may upset younger or more sensitive kids, but none are graphic, many are kept to very brief descriptions, and, for the most part, everything turns out all right in the end. Most of the story takes place in Wyoming, so the harsh realities of the wilderness are prevalent. There's also a relatively descriptive account of a horse giving birth that could raise questions.

Fangirl,Beautiful coming-of-age story about fandom and first love.,"Cath is a freshman in college with a lot of social anxiety and only two things that make her feel completely at home: her outgoing identical twin sister Wren (who chose to live in another dorm) and her love of the fantasy book series Simon Snow (an obvious tribute to Harry Potter). The ultimate FANGIRL, Cath writes popular fanfiction for the Simon Snow fandom. Stuck with Reagan, a surly, opinonated upperclassman roommate with no sense of boundaries, Cath barely leaves her dorm room. Despite her desire to stay away from people, Cath must deal with the near constant presence of Reagan's smiley, friendly, chatty boyfriend, Levi -- who begins to draw her out of her shell, and even more frightening, charm his way into her heart.
","Fangirl isn't just a charming love story about people, it's also a love story about fiction and the power of books and fandoms. Rowell, whose first book Attachments was a ""chick lit"" romantic comedy, burst onto the YA scene early in 2013 with the critically acclaimed misfit romance Eleanor & Park. She's apparently cranking out the quality realistic fiction with her follow-up out a scant eight months later. Fangirl shares a few similarities with E&P: the Nebraska setting, an intelligent, introverted girl who doesn't say much, and a guy who's almost too good to be true.
Every chapter begins with excerpts from not only Cath's fanfiction but also the ""canon"" of the Potter-like Simon Snow books. If you pay even cursory attention to the book-within-a-book, it's obvious that Simon, Baz, and Gemma T. Leslie are stand-ins for Harry, Draco, and author J.K. Rowling. Through her writing, Cath can express things she can't in real life, where she's extremely reclusive and socially inept. The only person besides Cath's party-girl sister, Wren, who can see the real her is Levi -- the kind of swoon-worthy guy that's sure to become any reader's literary crush. Cath and Levi have a host of issues, but their romance, slow and steady and startlingly real, will make anyone a believer in how books and love go hand in hand.","Parents need to know that Fangirl is the second young adult novel by New York Times bestselling author Rainbow Rowell. Set in a present Nebraska college (instead of an '80s Nebraska high school like Eleanor & Park), Fangirl follows an 18-year-old introvert's first year away at university. A hermit who only leaves the room for class, protagonist Cath is secretly a prodigious fanfiction writer in the Simon Snow fandom (think Harry Potter). While Cath is a virgin who doesn't drink or even really curse, other characters use strong language pretty regularly (""f--k,"" ""a--hole,"" ""douche,"" ""s--t,"" etc.) and discuss their sexual experience. The actual sexual content is fairly tame for a college-set story: limited to kissing and making out partially undressed in bed. Through Cath's introversion and Levi's dyslexia, the book also explores social anxiety and learning disabilities, as well as the importance of taking risks, academically and personally.

"The Fire Chronicle: The Books of Beginning, Book 2",Time-travel sequel even more fantastic than first book.,"The Fire Chronicle is Book 2 of John Stephen's trilogy The Books of Beginning. Book 1, The Emerald Atlas, began the adventure of the three siblings who are caught up in a world of magic, wizards, and evil creatures as they search for their missing parents. That story ends as they learn that part of their mission is to collect the three magical books and bring them together to save the world of magic. They have the first book; now to find the second. The kids are separated after escaping from yet another horrible orphanage. Kate spends most of the book time-traveling to different places to escape evil pursuers and get back to her brother and sister. Michael and Emma, meanwhile, have gone off on adventures of their own. With their wizard-mentor and his loyal protector, they head into a dangerous, mysterious world Michael has seen in his dream. Helped by elves and a dragon, pursued by screechers and trolls, they escape one danger after another in their pursuit of the book of fire. Whether Michael can learn to trust himself and take on the task of Keeper of the Chronicle is part of his struggle. While Book 1 was primarily Kate's story, Book 2 is Michael's.
","This book is terrific! It's as good or better than the first, and more complicated. Stephens is a captivating storyteller who creates a world of fantasy and magic with all its creatures and battles and just the right amount of scary monsters and warmhearted orphan story thrown into the mix. All of the characters, even the elves and trolls, have personalities; the set descriptions make even the fantastic seem real, and the plot twists and turns in unexpected ways. Pursuits are scary, and escapes hair-raising! While some may find the time-traveling sequences confusing, others will think they add a complexity that's completely engaging.
Readers of all ages will find this a real page-turner. Those who are impatient about how things turn out may want to gather all three books in the trilogy before even starting it. One story is so connected to the other that none stands completely on its own. Each chapter and book has a cliff-hanger ending that makes the reader want to turn the next page, even when there is none.","Parents need to know that The Fire Chronicle is the second installment in the action-packed time-traveling fantasy trilogy The Books of Beginning, and it's just as good, if not better. Again, it's good vs. evil as three siblings continue their search for their parents amid a magical, sometimes scary, world of elves, dwarves, trolls, screechers, dragons, giants and, of course, wizards. The Fire Chronicle has more gory warfare and other fantasy violence, than The Emerald Atlas (a troll is decapitated, and one of the main characters is shot). But the book also has spectacular moments of heroism, unexpected twists, and humor. The complex time-travel element may confuse younger readers who tackle this book on their own. Also, the dark, sometimes nightmarish atmosphere may unsettle more impressionable readers. But all of that is exactly what will hold the unflagging interest of those ready for such an thrilling, adventurous read.

Summer of the Mariposas,Fantastical quest explores sisterhood and Mexican legends.,"The five Garza sisters (cinco hermanitas) are enjoying an otherwise unremarkable summer in the border town of Eagle Pass, TX, when they come across a dead body floating in the Rio Grande. After second-oldest Juanita discovers his family photo and license, she convinces her younger sisters -- twins Velia and Delia and baby sis Pita -- to attempt to return the body to his address in Mexico. Oldest sister Odilia, 15, thinks the idea is crazy but when she sees a vision of the mythical La Llorona (the Weeping Woman) insisting they go, she relents. With magical earrings to protect them and La Llorona to guide them, the Garzas head across the border to deliver the man, but their return home to their mother turns into an Odyssey-like journey filled with perilous obstacles.
","McCall obviously writes what she knows; the firsthand knowledge of being raised Mexican and American (with so many sisters!) comes through in her chingly realistic story. Not only did she grow up in the same town as her characters, but she also has five younger sisters to whom she dedicated the book. Although the sisters make a lot of decisions that will make adult readers cringe in horror, it makes perfect sense that alternately naive and know-it-allish preteens and adolescents would make a lot of mistakes on a fantastical journey toward self-discovery and reconciliation with their mother.
The author excels at depicting the love between mothers and children. Whether it's the cancer-stricken Mami in Under the Mesquite or the downtrodden and jilted Mamá (or the eternally grieving La Llorona) in Summer of Mariposas, Garcia McCall beautifully describes the unconditional and fierce way a mother cares for her hijitas. It's hard to find truly multicultural literature for tweens and teens, so it's a relief to know authors like Garcia McCall make it a priority to explore the way bilingual kids navigate both cultures.","Parents need to know that Summer of the Mariposas is the second book by award-winning author Guadalupe Garcia McCall. The novel is a loose adaptation of Homer's Odyssey featuring five Mexican-American sisters, ages 10 to 15, on an epic quest. The girls face danger several times, just like Odysseus, and must vanquish each potential threat to return home to their mother in Texas. Although there is some mild violence, there is no strong language or sex, so it's an educational and entertaining choice for mature middle-grade readers, not just young-adult fans. Readers will learn a great deal about Mexican folklore and legends, as well as many Spanish words and terms. Ultimately, Summer of the Mariposas promotes the bond of sisterhood and the love between mother and daughters. In June 2018, publisher Lee & Low released n edition in Spanish.

Foxheart,"Girl and dog pal face riveting, intense fight to save magic.","As FOXHEART opens, in the world of the Star Lands (which among other things has two moons, one of them purple), the fearsome Wolf King has all but stamped out magic and is worshipped by the people. HIs followers include the nuns at the orphanage where a 3-year-old girl is left one day by her parents nd spends the next few years refusing to reveal her name, getting bullied by mean girls for her odd appearance, and generally bedeviling the nuns. By the time she turns 12, she's chosen the name Quicksilver and shown enough skill at stealing that she plans to become the greatest thief in the Star Lands -- aided by the scruffy dog Fox, her boon companion and partner in crime. But after a murderous attack on the orphanage by the Wolf King himself and the sudden appearance of a strange old lady and her dog, Quicksilver and Fox must travel back in time to stop the Wolf King's devastation before it starts and keep the Star Lands safe for magic.
","Claire Legrand's tour de force delivers a magical misfit heroine and a heart-stealing dog in a riveting cosmic conflict, with much devastating loss and joyous triumph along the way. Foxheart brings a lot of positive messages as its imaginative plot unfurls, and raises a lot of relatable themes, from fledgling friendship gone wrong to abandonment issues. Legrand packs rich characterization, world-building, and exploration into her imaginative, fast-moving story. Many readers will want to bring along a box of tissues for the journey.","Parents need to know that Foxheart, by  Claire Legrand, is a deeply satisfying stunner of a tale that requires some emotional maturity from the reader.

The plot involves a heroine who aspires to be the best thief in her world, as well as parents who abandon their children, a magical boy who murders his family, and friends who fall short and/or betray each other at the worst possible moment.

The Geek's Guide to Unrequited Love,Sweet story of geek boy desperately trying to get the girl.,"Graham has fallen in love with his best friend and comic book-writing collaborator, Roxy. He decides he needs to bare his soul to her. New York Comic Con is approaching, providing the perfect place to declare his love, as the two share many interests revolving around comics, graphic novels, and superheroes. Unfortunately for Graham, one well-laid plan after another goes awry. As he scrambles to figure out other romantic gestures, he and his friends meet other kids, who further thwart his plans. Graham is left alternately fuming and despondent, and his opportunities to confess his love to Roxy dwindle. Through the course of the Comic Con weekend, he figures out a lot about himself, his family, his friendships, and what it means to truly love someone.
","This tale of a comic book geek's plan to profess his love to his best friend is sweet and funny. It nails teen relationships and Comic Con culture without stooping to stereotypes. Those into comics, graphic novels, superheroes, and video games likely will love this book. Author Sarvanaz Tash gets the details of this culture right. The characters are smart, funny, creative, and inquisitive, not pedantic, annoying nose-pickers as these kids are so often portrayed. The environment of Comic Con is well detailed and paints the buzzing excitement in the halls. Graham is a wonderful main character. He's a tortured, lovesick teen but not annoyingly so. He tries too hard to control the weekend in which he's to profess his love to Roxy but quickly learns that he needs to go with the flow and let things happen naturally. He also learns that facing up to adversity makes him a better writer. His character growth in the book is fun to follow. The other characters are all interesting and add a lot of flavor to the story, and the interactions among the kids adds most of the humor. Tash writes authentic teen dialogue.

The Lorax,Seuss fable has become environmentalist classic.,"When his beloved Truffula Trees are hacked down to make Thneeds (""which everyone needs"" -- supposedly), the mustachioed little Lorax protests angrily. Unfortunately, the potato-shaped crusader's gripes are in vain. The greedy industrialist Once-ler won't stop until the last Truffula is felled and the surrounding ecosystem is hopelessly polluted. This Seussian fable has become an environmentalist classic.
","Few fiction writers -- for children or adults -- have successfully melded politics and good storytelling, but Dr. Seuss succeeds. He does it by explaining simply and clearly the process of building an industry at the expense of an ecosystem. The book is an excellent teaching tool, but despite its humor it isn't the most enjoyable of Dr. Seuss' works. Of course, environmental devastation isn't a cheerful topic.
Unfortunately, the idyllic scenes in which the Brown Bar-ba-loots frolic under the furry-lollipop tufts of the Truffula Trees while the Swomee-Swans sing and the Humming-Fish hum are ... well, boring. Luckily, the pint-sized hero is quirky enough to be compelling: The bushy-mustachioed Lorax has a folksy, righteous manner and is a guilt mongerer for a good cause. His harangues against the unrepentant Once-ler are both funny and poignant.","Parents need to know that this tale, told in Dr. Seuss' trademark rhymes, is a good introduction to environmental awareness.

In the vaguely medieval world of the story, the Folk are mysterious underground creatures whose anger must be kept in check. This Folk Keepers do this by providing them with food and, when necessary, absorbing their anger and cruelty.
But then she is sent to be Keeper at Marblehaugh Park, on the edge of the sea, where the Folk are stronger, mysteries abound, and Corinna's true heritage and latent powers begin to surface. As her blossoming womanhood becomes harder to hide, she finds her life threatened by Sir Edward, master of the Hall, and falls in love with Finian, his cousin.
","This lyrical and exciting novel has something for everyone: breathtaking adventure, romance, fantasy, revenge, humor, mystery, folklore, and a tough-minded, self-reliant heroine. Corinna tells her own story in journal format, with entries dated by numerous saints' days. Her voice is wickedly clear, though she herself is often confused, the voice of one who was powerless, and who has learned to find and take power wherever she can.
Though she lies and engages in petty and spiteful revenge on all who trouble her, she is an appealing heroine nonetheless, for her journal reveals her uncertainty, and the reasons for her behavior, as well as the sacrifices she willingly makes to ensure that none can take advantage of her. And as she begins to discover who and what she really is, young readers are both excited and satisfied.","Parents need to know that the protagonist is deceptive and vengeful, but proves to be a strong and admirable heroine.

","Laura Sibson's coming-of-age novel thoughtfully takes on issues of childhood sexual assault, substance abuse, and consent, as well as the complicated nature of healing from trauma.

Though Skye makes some unhealthy choices to cope, she grows towards responsible maturity over the course of the story. Creative teens will especially appreciate how Skye uses art to understand her experiences. Skye is a character that young people will surely root for.
Teens will also benefit from the novel's look at consent in several different situations. The message that consent must be freely and enthusiastically given comes through loud and clear. With its practical treatment of teen sexuality, the book doesn't underestimate or condescend to its young adult readers.

Where the Red Fern Grows,Tearjerker about country boy and his hound dogs.,"Billy is growing up dirt-poor in the Ozarks during the Grreat Depression of the 1930s. More than anything, he wants a pair of redbone coon hounds. As it is financially out of the question for his parents to buy them, he works and saves for two years to buy them himself, then hikes barefoot 60 miles round-trip over the mountains and through the woods to the nearest town to pick them up. He then spends months training the pups to be the best hounds in the hills. His dreams all come true as he spends every night out hunting in the hills with his dogs, and their fame spreads far and wide. Billy and his dogs are so good that his grandfather enters them in a championship coon hunt against grown men.
","Arguably the greatest boy-and-his-dog story of all time, this is, for many kids, the book that introduces them to the power of literature. No one, adult or child, gets through this book without weeping, usually more than once, yet it never feels manipulative or trite -- it's a good, honest cry. For more than five decades, it has remained near the top of the list of kids' favorite books. It reveals a rural America where a boy could ramble through the woods and mountains with his dogs all night long, in complete freedom. It also shows an image of boyhood as strong, brave, emotional, honest, gritty, and loyal. Billy is an archetype that, like the world he inhabits, is virtually extinct, except in literature. This exciting, heartbreaking, uplifting book is based on the author's own boyhood. ","Parents need to know that Where the Red Fern Grows is a classic of children's literature that's been a beloved and powerfully emotional book for generations. First published in 1961, it's the story of a boy in the Ozarks during the Great Depression who gets a pair of dogs as puppies and raises them to compete in a raccoon-hunting championship. So it includes descriptions of hunting, killing, and skinning animals.

"The Traitor's Game, Book 1","Royal intrigue, mild romance in action-packed fantasy.","In THE TRAITOR'S GAME, Kestra, who's 16, has been happily living away from her tyrannical father, second in power only to the king. Unexpectedly called back home, Kestra suspects that she'll have to face an arranged marriage when she gets there. But a rebel faction has other ideas about how Kestra can be useful, so they kidnap her while she's on the road. Using threats against the people she cares about, the rebels force Kestra to undertake a dangerous mission, one that will force her to betray her family. As her feelings for the rebel Simon grow, she becomes less and less sure of whom to trust, and whom to betray. With the fate of the kingdom at stake, Kestra will have to navigate a tangled web of dark secrets, including a shocking truth about herself.
","A veteran of fantasies for kids, author Jennifer A. Nielsen makes a switch to older middle-grade kids by adding a dash of romance to this action-packed fantasy adventure. The Traitor's Game offers intrigue, plot twists, secrets, magic, an evil king, a ruthless rebel leader, and two teen protagonists struggling to find their way through it all.
Kestra, 16, and Simon, a year or two older, take turns narrating the story. But instead of adding insight to events and motives, the voices of Kestra and Simon are too similar, and the reader may sometimes have to pause to remember who's talking now. The plot moves along at a good pace, with some predictability especially for teen readers, but some surprises along the way, too. Fantasy action/adventure fans will enjoy the rollercoaster ride to the open ending that doesn't satisfy but should leave them eager for the next installment.","Parents need to know that The Traitor's Game is the first in a planned fantasy trilogy by Jennifer A. Nielsen, author of the Ascendance and Mark of the Thief trilogies. Some of her series have been for kids ages 8 and 10. This book is aimed at a slightly older tweens-and-up audience, mostly thanks to romantic elements like feelings of attraction and a few brief kisses. There's lots of action and violence, some of it fantasy and some real-world, that isn't gory but does mention blood a few times. Torture with magical devices describes pain in some detail. Protagonist Kestra defies gender stereotypes by preferring weapons training and exploring the outdoors, but her character needs work when it comes to how she treats people and lets her temper get the better of her. It's free of profanity and any mention of alcohol, drugs, or tobacco, making it OK for tweens who are ready to add a dash of romance to their fantasy adventures.

The novel ends on a cliffhanger and leaves readers wondering what happens next to Ava and her friends in the final installment.

To achieve the perfect temperature for charving, Oggie must always walk with cheese in his back pocket. So no, he's not the most popular of kids … until someone unexpected notices his hidden talent and has special plans for him.

"The Rule of Thoughts: The Mortality Doctrine, Book 2",Second book in cyberpunk saga loses steam.,"THE RULE OF THOUGHTS picks right up where The Eye of Minds left off, with its protagonist, Michael, discovering that he's a sentient computer program inhabiting the body of an unsuspecting boy. Determined to stop Kaine, the rogue sentient program intent on populating Earth entirely with human bodies harboring digital minds, Michael sets off in search of his hacker friends, Bryson and Sarah. With no idea whom they can trust, the three teen hackers must rely on their own instincts and programming skills to protect themselves and their loved ones.
","The Rule of Thoughts suffers from Second Novel in a Trilogy Syndrome. Sure, there's plenty of action, double crosses, and hair's-breadth escapes, but some of the frenetic scenes begin to feel like so much running in place. Characters frequently withhold crucial information from each other for obscure reasons. This ploy grows old quickly, seeming to be more for the author's convenience than for the organic needs of the plot. Nevertheless, The Rule of Thoughts does find some fresh twists in its cyberpunk scenario, and young readers will be left eagerly awaiting the final installment.","Parents need to know that The Rule of Thoughts is a fast-paced cyberpunk thriller set in a virtual gaming world and in the ""real world."" It follows three teenage hackers as they search for Kaine, a sentient program that has gone rogue and is downloading new personalities into the brains of unsuspecting humans. The book contains some violence (monster attacks, hand-to-hand combat in a warfare scenario), but the mayhem's usually not described in detail and usually doesn't have mortal consequences. The strongest language is ""damn"" and ""hell,"" which are used one or two times each.

Tales of the Peculiar,"Gore, sweetness in kids' tales from Miss Peregrine's world.","In the life of an epically successful series, there often comes a collection of childhood stories that helped make the characters what they are. Now it's Miss Peregrine's turn with TALES OF THE PECULIAR, a collection of stories (""edited"" by a series character) essential to the upbringing of children with deep secrets and unusual powers. One tale, concerning an ill-fated relationship between peculiars and cannibals, teaches the wisdom of being content with what you have. Another tells of a man who seems to be turning into an island. There's also an origin tale of the first ""ymbrene"" -- bird-women like Miss Peregrine who create loops in time to protect peculiars -- and lots more pearls of wisdom in strange, sometimes sad, and often sweet stories.
","Fans of the Miss Peregrine series will love this collection of ""childhood tales"" involving time travel and unusual powers, but if you've somehow missed the craze, this isn't a bad place to start. Author Ransom Riggs offers the collection of tales no peculiar child should be without -- while warning all others to stay away, making it all the more irresistible.
In contrast to the original series, which used lots of strange vintage photographs to help tell the story, Tales of the Peculiar begins each installment with an evocative black-and-white image by Andrew Davidson.","Parents need to know that Tales of the Peculiar, by Ransom Riggs (Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children), is a collection of stories allegedly meant for peculiar children trying to make sense of the world and their place in it. It follows the time-honored tradition of sharing/inventing children's tales much loved by characters in a book series (see Tales of Beedle the Bard). Supposedly edited by series character Millard Nullings, and dedicated to Miss Peregrine herself, the stories range from dire warnings to happily-ever-after. As we've come to expect from the Miss Peregrine series, there's creepiness aplenty in these fables (such as the folks who make a nice living for themselves selling their limbs to cannibals and then growing them back) but a lot of heart and sweetness at the core.

When her parents tell her she has to pay them back for the money they lost on the camp, she takes a job as a makeup rep for a new cosmetics company with a ""beauty's on the inside"" philosophy. Ignoring her training DVDs, Massie finds she's a lot more successful when she tells girls they're ugly and need to fix themselves. Suddenly business is booming. It's all going well until the company's president drops in to see Massie's selling techniques first-hand.
","This book is $6.99 -- real girls should save their hard-earned babysitting money for a better beachy read.
This series releases one book a month during the summer of 2008; the first one -- MASSIE -- hit the top of the bestseller list right away. Kids who love reality shows and news about celebs like Paris Hilton will dive right in. The author tries to add humor in the fact that girls like Massie will never change, but it's not clever enough or scathing enough to be truly funny. And wouldn't it be nicer if she really learned from her mistakes? Then you could actually root for Massie in the end instead of wishing she'd suffer some crueler fate.
The worst part of the book is the way it's written. If you stripped out all mentions of designer brands, the book would be half the length (and that's barely an exaggeration). What's left is a bunch of text-messaging slang, catty comments stepped up with pop culture references, and a description of a very improbable summer job for an eighth grader. Oh, and she earns enough to pay back her parents for a summer of riding camp in just one week. Right. ","Parents need to know that if they're on the fence about whether to let tweens read this book series, the best test is whether you think reality shows about out-of-touch rich girls are out of line or harmless fun (think My Super Sweet 16).

The main character is in middle school and focused on shopping, winning, and telling other girls that they're ugly so she can sell makeup at her summer job. When there's a lesson to be learned (winning isn't everything, beauty is on the inside), part of the humor is supposed to be that Massie will never change. This is a quick beach read and the first in the Clique summer series; each girl in Massie's ""Pretty Committee"" will get her own book -- one a month from April to August 2008.

Soon, he's discovered a handful of gay students, and they form a support group (they call it the Geography Club so no one will suspect -- or want to join). Things are going well for Russel, who's got new support, and even a new secret boyfriend. But when a teacher gives an interview to the school paper saying that -- by mere coincidence -- a gay kid at the school approached her about starting a group, tensions begin to rise in the club. After the school outcast is incorrectly pinpointed as the gay kid, Russel has to figure out how much he's willing to risk to do the right thing.
","Readers will certainly understand gay Russel's fear of being found out, and his happiness at learning he's not alone. Even with the club, Russel is pretty much in hiding -- a traditional plight for gay characters that many modern protagonists no longer experience -- but readers will appreciate that Russel doesn't loathe himself or try to change who he is.
Some of the writing here strains credibility a bit -- Disney animation-loving Russel at times seems too stereotypical, and his romantic relationship with a popular athlete never feels authentic. But while it may not be the smoothest read, it is a book that will appeal to both straight and gay readers, and is likely to make teens think about tolerance and their own responsibility to stand up for their peers -- and themselves.","Parents need to know that this gay-themed coming-of-age story features some strong language, cruel taunting, and other questionable behavior, including the main character's decision to go alone and at night to meet someone he just chatted with online. Russel is pretty much in hiding about his sexuality, but doesn't loathe himself or try to change who he is. In the end, this book will make teens think about tolerance and their own responsibility to stand up for their peers -- and themselves.

No Hugs Till Saturday,Loving reminder that giving up hugs isn't easy.,"Felix is a pretty big kid and most of the time he remembers the rules. Of course, when he doesn't there are consequences. Reasonable consequences, maybe, but still Felix isn't too happy when his mom lays down the law. This time he's mad enough to make his own rule: No hugs till Saturday! The rest of the book explores Felix's feelings about hugs throughout the day as he gets busy, sometimes needs help, and sometimes feels lonely.
","Kids will relate to Felix's burgeoning independence and his sometimes contrary mommy-centric feelings. What preschooler hasn't wanted a little more control around the house? With a straightforward story and detailed illustrations, Downing creates a picture book with a story that's richer than readers might expect.
Parents will catch how complicated Felix's feelings really are and can use the book as a way to discuss their own kids' sometimes contrary emotions. For example, Felix may want to punish his mother just the tiniest little bit for taking away his baseball, but he doesn't want to punish himself. So when he feels jealous seeing his baby sibling getting lots of cuddling, he decides that maybe he can move the ""no hugs"" date back a day because clearly ""Mama was missing his hugs."" Parents can point out in the picture that Felix's expression and body language show that maybe it's not just Mommy who's doing the missing.","Parents need to know that kids will relate to this independent little dragon who makes a rule that's meant to be broken.

The One Memory of Flora Banks,Gripping thriller about a teen who can't make new memories.,"As THE ONE MEMORY OF FLORA BANKS begins, 17-year-old Flora is living with her parents in Cornwall on the English coast. Her parents have told her that the removal of a brain tumor when she was 10 left her with no short-term memory. She remembers her life before age 10, but since then, anything she does or anyone she meets is almost immediately forgotten. Happily, she's had a best friend named Paige since she was 4, nd that ongoing relationship is at the core of Flora's life. But at a going-away party for Paige's boyfriend, Drake, Flora kisses him and then never forgets that moment. Paige finds out and is furious. She tells Flora she's no longer her friend and will never speak to her again. When Flora's parents make a sudden trip to Paris to be with her desperately ill brother, she's left alone in the house with Paige looking out for her. Or so her parents think. Instead, Flora finds a credit card and her passport and leaves for Norway to find Drake, who she believes will be able to unlock her memory. ","This can't-put-it-down mystery/thriller is packed with secrets, lies, and unexpected twists that take readers from the coast of England to the icy reaches of the Arctic Circle. The pace of The One Memory of Flora Banks builds slowly and steadily and then quickens to an almost frenzied pace that mirrors Flora's emotional state as she reaches Norway and everything she (and the reader) think they know begins to crash down around her. Is she mad, off her meds, or the only one who knows the truth? While readers may never have met anyone like Flora, author Emily Barr has made her an immediately likable and identifiable character with many of the same challenges faced by teens -- overprotective parents, quarrels with your best friend, the desire to be independent and find your own way. ","Parents need to know that Emily Barr's The One Memory of Flora Banks is the story of a 17-year-old English girl who has anterograde amnesia. Flora can't remember anything that's happened to her since the age of 10. Not what happened a week before or even an hour before, until she kisses her best friend's boyfriend and creates a memory that stays with her. It's so powerful that Flora follows him to a small town on the Arctic Circle, certain he holds the key to unlocking her memory. But what she discovers shocks Flora and is certain to surprise readers. This is a ""quick, turn the page I can't wait to see what happens next"" psychological thriller without sex, violence, or profanity. An English import, it's already a big best-seller in Europe.

Echoes Between Us,Teens haunted by more than ghosts in contrived romance.,"In ECHOES BETWEEN US, two teens get caught up in a tangle of love, ghosts, and deep secrets. Quirky girl Veronica lives with her widower dad in a big house that's split into two flats and might be haunted. Popular jock Sawyer moves in downstairs with his divorced mom and little sister. The two teens end up working on an important school project together, one that involves hunting ghosts. As their attraction to each other grows, the secrets they keep threaten to drive them apart. Both feel that maintaining a strong facade will help hold their families together, when in reality, the stress is damaging them and their families. Veronica's afraid to share her health concerns with her dad because her mother died of a similar illness. She's also reluctant to get too close anyone, thinking she's sparing them pain if she ends up being sicker than she realizes. Sawyer's reeling from his parent's divorce and his dad's abandonment. He takes on the responsibility of being a parent to his little sister and, at times, to his mother. In addition, he's hiding an adrenaline-rush addiction that threatens his health and emotional well-being. This stress and uncertainty, along with issues with their friends, cause some soul searching and tough decisions for the two teens.
","This teen romance delivers on some important issues but tries to cover too much ground, losing focus in the process. Echoes Between Us tackles illness, a dead parent, addiction, enabling, parental abandonment, romance, ghosts, bullying, learning disabilities, and ebbing friendships. A diary of a young woman with tuberculosis in the early 1900s is thrown in for good measure. The story ends up feeling contrived, as through it were written by a focus group, picking various plot lines and character types from bestselling YA novels. This might, in fact, appeal to readers who can't get enough of turbulent teen romances.
Author Katie McGarry does a solid job of showing the costs to teens who shoulder too heavy a physical and emotional burden. Victoria feels responsible for her dad's happiness after her mom dies, and Sawyer feels he's forced to care for his sister and his mom. In wanting to keep their family lives stable, both hide important problems from their families. These are common and relatable issues for teens and adults. Showing Victoria and Sawyer seeking help and learning lessons in how to care for themselves is the best part of the book. Unfortunately, the good aspects of the book get buried under the numerous plot lines.","Parents need to know that Echoes Between Us, by Katie McGarry, is a romance novel about two teens falling in love, their personal problems, and ghosts. The teens, Veronica and Sawyer, are opposites. She's an outsider at school, due to her nonmainstream way of dressing and quirky behavior. He's a popular swimmer, with a clique of equally popular friends who say mean things about Victoria. Each has painful personal secrets that keep them from living their lives to the fullest. Sawyer, his mom, and sister move into a supposedly haunted flat below Victoria and her dad, and some unexplained occurrences and visions back up the idea of ghosts. When Veronica and Sawyer end up working together on a school project, they see each other in a new light, with romance and complications following. Because it's a romance, expect lots of descriptive kissing and making out, plus numerous descriptions of how attractive and sexy each character is. The ghost aspect isn't too scary, especially for teen and older readers. Strong language is minimal (inlcuding ""damn,"" ""ass,"" ""bitch""). There's some drinking and drug use, though the only drug use is medical marijuana and the drinking is by an adult with a drinking problem. The story offers good discussion topics around communication between kids and parents, and how to ask for help from friends and family when you're in a tough spot. The author lists some crisis resources at the end of the book.

"The Terrible Two Get Worse: The Terrible Two, Book 2",Smart sequel serves up giggles with heartfelt touches.,"Miles and Niles are having a terrific fall, enlivening Yawnee Valley Science and Letters Academy with nearly daily pranks. But they go too far when they leave their mark on the annual school-wide photo and their frequent target, Principal Barkin, is fired. The boys feel bad, and they feel even worse when they realize the new principal -- Principal Barkin's father – is an even more powerful foe. This Principal Barkin makes school miserable for everyone except his grandson, Josh, whose bullying now goes unchecked. Miles and Niles feel responsible for everything that's happened. One good prank could set things right ... and to pull it off, they'll need to team up with a most unlikely ally.
","When a joke goes too far, the victim isn't the only one who suffers -- the Terrible Two must wrestle with their consciences in this lively sequel that pulls off sensitivity and slapstick humor. In THE TERRIBLE TWO GET WORSE: THE TERRIBLE TWO, BOOK 2, laughter proves to be the best revenge. The hilarity of the first book continues here, and as before, much of it surrounds Principal Barkin: Forced out of his job by his own dad, he ineptly pursues new hobbies such as making hand turkeys and soap -- each failed effort depicted with wonderful full-page illustrations by Kevin Cornell.
The tensions between adults and children are the core of the story, from the burden placed on the fifth Barkin serving as principal to Niles' disappointment with his parents' lack of interest in his accomplishments. There's thoughtful stuff here -- particularly themes of despotism and dissent -- but it's presented with a wink and a smile.","Parents need to know that The Terrible Two Get Worse: The Terrible Two, Book 2 is a smart and funny take on the power imbalance between kids and adults, lampooning busy grown-ups who pride themselves on power for its own sake. This sequel to The Terrible Two -- by authors Mac Barnett (Extra Yarn) and Jory John, with illustrator Kevin Cornell (Count the Monkeys) -- is sympathetic to the hapless target of the duo's elaborate pranks. The boys are in this just for fun, and they're dismayed when their childish fun has serious consequences. An authority figure deals severely with subordinates and plays favorites. A bully gets permission to steal money from a fundraiser. A villain gets his comeuppance with public humiliation.

The Bad Mood and the Stick,"Quirky, whimsical, insightful look at passing moods.","A bad mood moves from person to person and a stick gets passed around, too, in THE BAD MOOD AND THE STICK. This quirky look at fleeting emotions shows a whimsical sequence of events, starting with a girl who's in a bad mood (the mood hovers over her head like a cloud) and a stick just lying on the ground. When she picks up the stick and pokes her brother with it, that cheers her up and she tosses the stick into the bushes. Now her irritated mom holds the bad mood in her arms. Then the raccoon who caught the stick scares a man walking by. The man falls in the mud, and now the bad mood hovers over him, and so on, till the happy ending at a wedding where all the book's characters are invited -- even the raccoon.
","With whimsy and a knowing sense of human moodiness, Lemony Snicket helps kids see the temporary nature of a bad mood. Illustrator Matthew Forsythe's colorful, retro cartoon-like rt pictures it as a hovering, movable cloud -- which helps kids grasp that a bad mood comes and goes. The Bad Mood and the Stick is delightful as  simple, funny story (they'll giggle at the man pictured in his underwear) with a touch of romance (the muddied light-skinned man falls in love with the brown-skinned lady at the dry cleaners who cleans his pants). But on another level, it can spark  discussion of feelings, how chance can ffect what happens to us, nd how everybody gets in a bad mood once in a while for various reasons.
The stick has a role to play, too, and can trigger  good or bad mood, depending on how it's used.","Parents need to know that Lemony Snicket's The Bad Mood and the Stick deals with feelings and how everyone can get in a bad mood sometime. The story pictures a bad mood like an angry-faced cloud that moves from person to person and hovers over the one who's in a bad mood -- until that person's mood changes and it moves on. But the tone is light and funny, and the inanimate stick triggers some of the action that affects people's moods. This would be a great book to spark discussion about feelings and how they can change due to changing circumstances.

"The After-Room: The Apothecary Series, Book 3","Love, magic, adventure, ghosts in thrilling series finale.","It's 1955, and after the harrowing events in Book 2, 15-year-olds Janie Scott and Benjamin Burrows (who's living with the Scott family since his father's death left him an orphan) are trying to adjust to a normal Midwestern high school. It isn't going well, and their romance seems to be on hold, as Benjamin's always depressed and preoccupied. When he confesses to Janie that he's been using a potion to communicate with his late father, who seems to be in a between-the-worlds place called THE AFTER-ROOM, the 15-year-olds realize their adventures aren't over. Soon, thanks to a surprise offer of a screenwriting gig in Rome for the elder Scotts, they're all in Italy, trying to evade sinister forces who'd like to use Benjamin's brews for their own purposes. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, their chemist friend Jin Lo, who'd plunged into the sea when the potion that turned her into a bird wore off, washes up on an island occupied by a U.S. Navy officer who's watching the Chinese. From their different points on the globe, they all work to prevent the uranium stolen in Book 2 from falling into the wrong hands nd to keep a grief-stricken man from nuking China to avenge his son's death.
","Author Maile Meloy's imaginative mix of magic, Cold War history, and teen romance comes to a satisfying close as two 15-year-olds and their adult allies face spies, gangsters, pirates, and the dead. Told from the perspectives of characters on opposite sites of the world, the plot moves along quickly as the heroes encounter colorful locals, dodge deadly perils, pursue magical knowledge, and learn a few life lessons while trying to avert nuclear destruction. Thanks to Meloy's skill as a writer, characters are intriguing individuals; normally implausible plot developments such as the Scotts' sudden writing job in Italy make perfect sense; nd bits of incidental detail such as a song and a robin's-egg-blue dress conjure up the feeling of life in the '50s. Ian Schoenherr's plentiful illustrations bring the story to life with compelling detail and airborne adventure.
There's enough description of foregoing events that you won't be entirely lost if you start here, but you'll miss a lot. Start with Book 1. And, though the story arc wraps up nicely at the end, there's a glimmer of hope that we may not have seen the last of these characters.","Parents need to know that The After-Room concludes the imaginative Apothecary trilogy, in which two teens join adult allies in an ancient magical society to save the world from nuclear destruction in 1955. Characters regularly face great danger from assorted bad guys, including spies, gangsters, and pirates; they're often held prisoner, and one of them is the victim of a hit-and-run. As in previous books, they frequently brew and ingest potions, whose effects include telepathy and shape-shifting, and, in a new development, they converse with the dead, including the poet John Keats. The teen protagonists share a few sweet kisses amid the dangers; two adults meet and eventually marry. An adult character who causes a lot of trouble is a problem drinker.

Otter Keeper is patient and tolerant nd understands that Otter's just a creative self-starter whose heart is in the right place.

Her broken family is spending the summer in her mother's Utah hometown, where Cedar meets a new friend, Leo, and lands a job working at the Summerlost theater festival. Leo loves theater and is fascinated by local legend Lisette Chamberlain, an actress who died mysteriously years ago. Cedar is drawn into the drama of Lisette's life, helping Leo conduct tours for Lisette's fans. As she learns more about Lisette and how her remarkable life and tragic death hauntingly linger for the town and her admirers, Cedar grapples with how the aching loss of her father and brother will color the rest of her days.
","This beautifully told story of a girl struggling to find normalcy after the horrific loss of her father and brother sneaks up on you, hooking you with its blend of heartbreak, healing, and hope. SUMMERLOST is a pitch-perfect offering from Ally Condie, best known for the fantasy Matched trilogy. Anyone who's dealt with loss -- whether the death of a loved one or a parting of ways with a friend -- will relate to Cedar's difficulty reconciling her past with her future. She struggles with regret, guilt, and fear, with her faith in the everyday badly shaken.
Cedar is haunted not only by what she loved and misses about her father and brother but by what she didn't get a chance to know and will never be able to understand.

"The Rose & the Dagger: The Wrath & the Dawn, Book 2",Satisfying sequel with surprising magical twists.,"In THE ROSE & THE DAGGER, Shahrzad is whisked away to a desert encampment after the city and palace of Rey are nearly destroyed. She reluctantly leaves behind her husband, the embattled Caliph, to keep his curse from causing more bloodshed. A good reason to flee, but in the encampment, which also houses her jilted ex, Tariq, and bands of fighters preparing to oust the Caliph, she's hardly safe. Not long after she arrives, a mercenary tries to kill her and threatens her sister Irsa. The only thing that keeps Shahrzad there is Irsa and her father, who's nearly comatose after stretching his magic with the use of a powerful book. Watching her father's slow recovery, Shahrzad fears his book will do more harm. She decides to find out more about it, and needs magic of her own to do it. Sneaking out at night, she tries out a small magic carpet and seeks out the magus who gave it to her. She hopes that he will not only help save her father but help her break her husband's horrible curse, as well.
","This satisfying sequel is mostly a star-crossed love story with a light sprinkling of flying carpet magic. Relationships get the most attention here, and with such compelling characters as Shahrzad and Khalid, it's a good focus to have. Author Renee Ahdieh goes all in with resolving conflicts between Khalid and Shahrzad's childhood love, Tariq -- this was well done -- and with improving Shahrzad's relationship with her often neglected sister. And complex political relationships, with the twists and turns of palace intrigue, stay intriguing to the end.
But can we get back to the magic carpets for a second? And a flying serpent and a fire guy and his crazy magical aunt in a secluded mountain hideaway? The Rose & the Dagger would have been astounding on all fronts if Ahdieh went all in here, as well, embracing the magical world just as much. Fantasy fans will long for more.","Parents need to know that The Rose & the Dagger is the second in the two-book The Wrath & the Dawn series that combines elements of the ""1001 Nights"" (or ""Arabian Nights"") within a fantasy love story. Here the caliph's bride and storyteller is Shahrzad, not Scheherazade. By this sequel, Shahrzad shows more of her strength by fighting to lift the curse her husband is under that convinced him to kill all his previous brides and nearly destroyed his city. There are a few skirmishes with swords and arrows. One beloved character dies of a sword wound with lots of blood, another suffers an arrow wound, with details on how the shaft is broken and arrow is removed. Another dies from a magic spell. A sexual assault is barely averted, and a character is drugged and kidnapped. Married characters have sex with kissing and touching described, and language doesn't get worse than ""bastard son of a whore."" One scene of heavy drinking finds the teen Calipha throwing up the next day.

Meet Julie: An American Girl,Plucky '70s American Girl fights for her rights.,"Nine-year-old Julie Albright moves with her mother and older sister to an apartment in San Francisco, above her mother's shop. Her parents are divorced. She starts the 4th grade at a new school and feels lonely -- her best friend Ivy is still back in her old neighborhood.
At school, she befriends a boy and learns of basketball team try-outs that are only for boys. Julie feels this is unfair and learns how to take a stand from her sister, mother, and friendly neighbor, a Vietnam veteran.
","Written by Megan McDonald of the popular Judy Moody series, MEET JULIE provides just the right amount of detail to give readers a taste of the fantastic 1970s. She doesn't skimp on what was hard about the era and provides positive examples of important people to Julie during this time, including her single mother and a veteran.
It's ironic that the squeaky-clean American Girl brand has added a child of the '70s as the latest in their family of period characters. Yes, it's the psychedelic 1970s with fatigue-wearing Vietnam veterans and teen girls throwing out labels like ""male chauvinist pig."" But Julie is a model 9-year-old with shiny blond hair, a strong sense of fairness, and an insatiable amount of energy -- in other words, she fits right in with the American Girl image. There are also plenty of references to things that American Girl readers will like: lava lamps, pet rocks, mood rings, and apple seed bracelets. (This seems like a marketing hook, too, so parents watch out.) Julie's life, though, is not an easy one for any 9-year-old. Her parents are newly divorced, she's changed schools, and she sees her dad every other weekend. Despite these challenges, Julie is, perhaps unrealistically, strong and overly confident. She presents the coach with a petition -- since there's no basketball team for girls, it's not fair that she can't try out for the boy's team. Her complaints go all the way to the School Board. Now that's some American Girl pluck.","Parents need to know that the main character, Julie, is part of the American Girl series that has its own stores selling all things American Girl: dolls, clothes, DVDs, etc. This first book in the series features a 9-year-old living in San Francisco in the '70s and captures issues and historical events of the era: President Nixon resigning; Vietnam veterans needing support; parents getting divorces (like Julie's); and the changing rights/roles of women, especially regarding Title Nine.

"The Merchant of Death: The Pendragon Series, Book 1","Stock story and characters, but still gripping.","When Bobby Pendragon is taken by his Uncle Press to an abandoned subway station in the Bronx, he discovers that he, like his uncle, is a Traveler, with the ability to ride ""flumes"" through space and time. Press takes Bobby through a flume to a world called Denduron, where an evil Traveler called Saint Dane is inciting war between the ruling Bedoowan and the virtually enslaved Milago miners. But almost as soon as they arrive, Press is captured by the Bedoowan and scheduled for execution.
Bobby doesn't understand anything of what's going on, and all he wants to do is go home. But, challenged by Loor, a warrior-Traveler from another world, he hatches a plan to rescue Press from the Bedoowan stronghold. Getting Press back, though, is only the beginning of stopping Saint Dane's plans for sowing chaos across the planet and throughout the universe.
","MacHale is the creator of such shows as Are You Afraid of the Dark nd Ghostwriter, and his screen work has given him a shrewd sense of pacing. Though the book is overlong, it will keep young fans of the fantasy/adventure genre breathlessly turning the pages. The story careens along entertainingly, and parts of it are quite exciting.
The downside of the video connection is that the characters are from Central Casting, and the plot follows a stock formula. It's a good formula, as formulas go, but it does give the books a certain been-there-done-that feel, exacerbated by the bizarre refusal of everyone to explain anything to Bobby, an obvious and annoying plot device. Still, it's plenty of fun, and young fans of the genre aren't looking for surprises anyway.","Parents need to know that there's a fair amount of fantasy violence here, and numerous killings by spear, arrow, and explosives.

The Pearl,Beautiful folk tale explores good and evil in human nature.,"A pearl diver named Kino and his wife, Juana, live with their only child, Cayotito, in a brush hut near the sea in Baja, California. Cayotito becomes ill, but Kino and Juana do not have the money to pay for a doctor's care. Kino prays that he will find a pearl large enough to exchange for the money to get Cayotito the help he needs. When he finds the \""pearl of the world,\"" however, evil forces threaten him and his precious family.
","Steinbeck's retelling of this Mexican folk tale, The Pearl, is beautiful and lyrical. The author uses evocative language to describe Kino's world and his emotional journey. In this novel, every feeling and every important part of Kino and Juana's world has a ""song"" that the characters ""sing"" to each other and hear in their hearts -- the song of evil, the song of family, the song of hope. It's a simple story, told with power and poetry by one of America's all-time greatest novelists.","Parents need to know that The Pearl is Nobel Prize-winning author John Steinbeck's interpretation of a Mexican folk story in which a poor pearl diver's life is changed by the discovery of a very large gem. This short novel makes an excellent introduction to literary criticism, as the author's use of symbolism is fairly simple for teen readers to analyze and understand. However, the message put forth by the book -- that man invites evil by trying to better his situation -- invites a lot of questions. Also, gender roles in the book are very old-fashioned, as the story offers a portrayal of poor, uneducated Mexican people as simple folk who live unquestioningly, as generations before them have lived.

The Airport Book,Fun account of family's travel day tells all about airports.,"A family of four finishes packing their suitcases and takes a taxi to the airport. Once there, they do all the things air travelers do: go through security, wait t the gate, board the plane, and then draw, read, and get snacks and drinks on board. Once they land, they get their luggage off the carousel -- and the little girl gets back her sock money she's been worried about, which was stowed in the cargo hold -- and Grandpa picks them up and nd drives them to the beach. ","This informative, funny family travel story is a perfect introduction to air travel for little ones. It covers all the bases, from sending items along the conveyor belt into the X-ray scanner to stowing bags in the plane's overhead bins. Running gags regarding various passengers -- such as the lady who keeps saying ""Blah blah blah blah blah"" into her cell phone -- and the thread of the toddler girl saying ""Monkey, monkey"" when she notices (but no one else does) that the tail of her packed-away sock monkey is poking out of her suitcase give kids a story to follow amid all the practicalities of a commercial flight day. Author-illustrator Lisa Brown's cartoon-like illustrations are fun nd accessible, with loads to look at on each spread nd lots of expression and personality in her main and supporting characters. The family at the center of the story features an African-American dad, a white mom, and mixed-race kids, which adds to the story's ppeal, especially for families looking for children's books with diverse characters.","Parents need to know that The Airport Book, by author-illustrator Lisa Brown, shows just about every detail of irplane travel, from going through security to taking your bags off the luggage carousel on the other end, while subtly telling a cute story of a family going to visit grandparents in a tropical place where palm trees nd beaches abound.

The Contract,"Fun tale of Jeter in Little League mixes action, messages.","THE CONTRACT is the first book in a series of middle-grade novels based on Derek Jeter's childhood and early baseball career. Eight-year-old Derek is determined to be the starting shortstop of his favorite team, the New York Yankees, but he has to get through Little League first! Derek's parents are behind him 100 percent, drafting a contract for him to sign, with him promising to maintain good grades, be a role model for his little sister, and always ct with respect and integrity. As he and his ragtag group of suburban teammates go through the season and school year, Derek has to deal with the responsibility of adhering to his contract, being a leader on and off the field, and striving to be a champion. ","The Contract is a winner for kids who love baseball, and Jeter is a perfect role model for any competitor, the embodiment of class and leadership. Derek learns -- as all kids do, eventually -- that talent isn't enough to succeed; it requires hard work, a support system, nd the ability to balance different challenges at the same time.
Though the writing definitely hits the reader over the head with the morals and messages, it's inspirational nonetheless to see how crucial a role Jeter's family played in his development, especially knowing that in the end young Derek does succeed, beyond even his wildest dreams. The baseball scenes are when the book gets fun, capturing the intense psychology and ups and downs of Little League accurately and with pizzazz. ","Parents need to know that The Contract is the exciting, positive, and meaningful story of Yankee legend Derek Jeter's Little League experience as an ambitious 8-year-old in Kalamazoo, Michigan. This is Jeter's first book for children (written with veteran children's book author Paul Mitchell) and the first installment in a planned 10-part series documenting young Derek's journey from small-town recreational ball to the Major League.

Smile,Delightful graphic novel follows teen girl's teeth troubles.,"Like many 12-year-olds, Raina is apprehensive about getting braces. But when she trips and knocks out her two front teeth, the fate of her teeth becomes even more traumatic. For the next four years, we follow Raina through many trips to the orthodontist, mouth surgeries, and a variety of dental contraptions. Meanwhile, Raina starts middle school, gets a crush on a boy who barely notices her, experiences the Loma Prieta Earthquake in San Francisco, and deals with friends who are not always supportive and are sometimes downright mean. As Raina's teeth go through extensive changes, Raina learns to stand up for herself and discovers that following her own interests, especially art, will lead to healthy friendships with people who like her for who she is.
","Telgemeier's simple, clean drawings in a soft color palette are easily accessible even to readers new to graphic novels, and there is also a rich, complex story to delve into. Raina's experiences with her teeth as she goes through middle and high school serve as an excellent metaphor for her life: Her teeth will never be perfect, but with a little work, they get a lot better. In SMILE, through incidents both meaningful and trivial that span the course of several years, we watch author and illustrator Raina Telgemeier grow up. Readers will enjoy figuring out that The Little Mermaid influenced Raina's future as a cartoonist, and they may relate to how Raina can always find comfort in the art room at school. But one of Smile's most outstanding qualities is its spot-on depiction of the subtle way middle school girls can undermine one another and how Raina eventually figures out when friends make her feel more bad than good, she shouldn't accept it.","Parents need to know that the autobiographical graphic novel Smile follows author Raina Telgemeier through her real-life experiences of having her teeth knocked out and the years of orthodontic work that follow during her early teen years. Because the story is true (although the names of the characters have been changed), not all of Raina's dilemmas are solved in the neatly wrapped-up way of most middle-grade novels, which may be disappointing to some readers. Although the cartoony drawings may indicate a light, fun story -- and there are certainly elements of that -- Smile is also a meaningful story of a teen's journey to self-acceptance.

Greta's Story: The Schoolgirl Who Went on Strike to Save the Planet,Accessible intro to Swedish teen climate activist's work.,"GRETA'S STORY: THE SCHOOLGIRL WHO WENT ON STRIKE TO SAVE THE PLANET finds Swedish teen Greta Thunberg increasingly convinced of the potentially planet-destroying effects of climate change as catastrophic fires rage across Europe. She's soon studying up obsessively on the issue, trying to find something she can do to prevent global catastrophe, and shocked that politicians seem not at all interested. Inspired by the examples of U.S. civil rights activist Rosa Parks and, more recently, the students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who became gun control activists after experiencing a mass school shooting, she cuts school, parks herself at the school's entrance with a handwritten sign ""School Strike for the Climate,"" takes a picture, and puts it on Instagram. Kids around the world see her posts and join the effort. Things take off from there.
","Italian author Valentina Camerini's accessible narrative introduces teen activist Greta Thunberg to a middle grade audience, addressing climate change, being on the autism spectrum, and social media strategy. Greta's Story moves along quickly from the hot summer of 2018 that changed the then-15-year-old's life, driving her to launch a climate strike at school and publicize it on Instagram. Kids with an interest in climate change or activism around some other cause will find a lot of information and probably some inspirational ideas here.
Readers dealing with autism spectrum disorder, which in Greta's case seems to be both a disability and a superpower, and depression, which she overcame to do her work, may find her story especially relatable.","Parents need to know that Greta's Story: The Girl Who Went on Strike to Save the Planet is an illustrated middle-grade introduction to teen environmental activist (and Time magazine's Person of the Year for 2019) Greta Thunberg. It was first published in Italian and later in a growing number of translations around the world. The book offers a lot of age-appropriate information about climate change, being on the autism spectrum (which affected Greta's becoming obsessed with the issue), and how she used social media to bring worldwide attention to her cause. The pivotal event is Greta's deciding to cut school to bring attention to the issue of climate change. Parents may want to discuss if, when, and why this might be appropriate. The story, by Italian author Valentina Camerini, is translated  by Moreno Giovannoni and illustrated appealingly by Veronica ""Veci"" Carratello.  Supplemental sections offer links to Greta's online posts, information about climate change, and practical steps individuals can take to reduce their negative impact.

Inside Out and Back Again,"Inspiring, educational immigrant story told in free verse.","The story is told through short free-verse poems, and takes place over the course of one year: In 1975, 10-year-old Ha and her family must leave Vietnam as the Communists take over her home city of Saigon. After secretly departing by ship and staying in two temporary refugee camps, Ha's family finally lands in Alabama with a sponsor family. There, they must learn a new language, go to school, find work, make friends, deal with bullies and suspicion -- and figure out how to become Americans. They must also say a symbolic and definitive goodbye to Ha's father, who was missing in action for 10 years. Readers follow Ha's feisty and honest journey as she navigates her family's emigration from Vietnam, heeds her mother's kind wisdom, deals with her older brothers (and benefits by their protection), meets bullies and kind strangers, and begins to believe in herself again.
","INSIDE OUT AND BACK AGAIN is a memorable story, told beautifully in free verse poetry. The poetry makes Ha's story easy to read and allows readers to fully experience a wide range of situations and emotions without being overwhelmed. Tweens will like the fast pace and Ha's childlike but authentic voice, and parents will appreciate the quality of the characters and opportunity to discuss values, culture, and choices. This story is filled with wisdom (Ha's mother warns her to ""be surprised,"" ""be agreeable,"" and ""learn to compromise,"") as well as humor (when Ha's mother says to her, ""You love to argue, right?"" she replies, ""No, I don't."")  While the Vietnam War is the backdrop to this story, the narration is free from judgment and politics.  The story is good for boys and girls in a wide age range, and it also lends itself well to a read-aloud experience. Overall, this is an inspiring story that can be read multiple times, each time providing readers with a deeper appreciation for the writing itself, the characters, and the poignant but subtle life lessons. ","Parents need to know that this book is written in a series of short free-verse poems, which are easy to read, fast-paced, descriptive, and poignant. Though it is never preachy or instructional, the short verse poems give much information about life in Vietnam, including the foods, clothing, traditions, the encroaching war, some politics, family structure, and more. Readers will also learn about life as an immigrant as Ha struggles with a new language, eats new foods, meets new kids, deals with attitudes toward Vietnamese immigrants -- and tries to blend Vietnamese customs with new American ones. While the main character is a 10-year-old girl, this story is suitable for boys and readers in a wide age range. Parents should know that this story is filled with beauty and hope even though its backdrop is the Vietnam War.

I've Loved You Since Forever,Simple book about parent-child love from Today show anchor.,"The text in I'VE LOVED YOU SINCE FOREVER lists a series of natural animal activities to express the idea that the love between a parent and child transcends time. ""I’ve loved you since forever. Before birds flew over rainbows, and monkeys swung on trees, there was you ... nd there was me."" At the end of the book, parent and child come together when ""you and I turned into we."" The text is paired with illustrations of the animals mentioned and their young.
","New parents brimming with love for their little ones and looking for ways to express it can find many kids' books about love, and this one by a celebrity who adopted suggests a timeless connection. I've Loved You Since Forever by Hoda Kotb travels well-trodden kid book territory. The long list of books for kids about love includes some excellent ones that focus on love for an adopted child -- for instance, I Love You Like Crazy Cakes by Rose A. Lewis and Jane Dyer, and Tell Me Again About the Night I Was Born by Jamie Lee Curtis and Laura Cornell. Kotb's book opens with a somewhat generic mention of a bird flying over a rainbow, and the rhythm of the text is a bit awkward, with some near-rhymes veering slightly off track (""trees"" and ""bees"" with ""we""). But it expresses the touching and reassuring message that parent and child were connected before birth, ""waiting for the day our stars would cross and you and I turned into we.""
Illustrator Suzie Mason adds warmth with her sweet pictures of animal parents and babies, showing a monkey riding on its mom's back, elephants twining trunks, a mother bird building her nest, and otters touching noses. To suggest the cosmic connection, she paints spreads of glistening night stars, underscoring the idea that parent and child, too, were up there twinkling.","Parents need to know that Hoda Kotb, co-anchor of the Today show, was inspired to write I've Loved You Since Forever when she adopted her baby daughter. The field of kids' books about love is crowded, and parents can find many excellent choices, including books that are universal and ones that incorporate adoption. This one doesn't address the subject of adoption directly, so has appeal for all families, though the idea that parent and child shared a connection before birth might have special meaning for adoptive families. The book has simple text nd warm art picturing animal parents and babies, with a human mom and her baby capping the story.

Bones of Faerie,Intriguing combination of magic and apocalypse.,"Liza has grown up in a world devastated by an all-out war years earlier against the world of Faerie, a war which left destruction and lingering effects in both worlds. In our world, like radiation, magic has imbued plants and trees with hostility to humans. Another result of this magical radiation is that some children are born with magical abilities, and in Liza's town, those children are killed as soon as this is apparent. After Liza's infant sister is killed, and her mother runs away, Liza discovers that she has visions of the past and future. Seeing her mother in those visions, and fearing what will happen when her father finds out about her ability, she too runs away, into the hostile forest.
","Fantasy genre fiction has a limited number of elements, so the novelty comes in how you mix them up, and the variations you introduce; this one brings some intriguing new ideas. It mixes the older form of fairy story (in which magical creatures from the fairy world were considered mischievous at best, downright wicked at worst) with the more modern post-apocalyptic novel. Set in a time when both earth and the world of Faerie have been ravaged by all-out war, and in which magic and nuclear radiation are equated, it is a potent mix of elements that have rarely been mixed before.
	This unique mash-up works, for the most part, because the author sets it in motion with a bang, and never lets the story flag. But the set-up is so fascinating that readers may be frustrated by the many unanswered questions the author leaves behind. One can only hope that this is intended to be the first book of a series, though no indication of this is given. As a stand-alone work it feels unfinished: as the introduction to a series it works brilliantly. We'll have to wait to see which it is.
 From the Book:
	No one knew why they came. No one even knew what they looked like. The War happened too fast, and the televisions people once had for speaking to one another all died the first day. Some said the faerie folk looked like trees, with gnarled arms and peeling brown skin. Others said they were dark winged shadows, with only their clear hair and silver eyes visible as they attacked us. Hair like that remained a sure sign a child was tainted with magic.
	But whatever the faerie folk looked like, everyone agreed they were monsters. Because once they were here they turned their magic against us, ordering the trees to seek human flesh and the stones to burn with deadly light. Even after the War ended and the faerie folk left this world, the magic they'd set loose lingered, killing still.","Parents need to know that there is some violence, and a baby is left out to die, her blood and cracked bones seen by her older sister.

Ocean Meets Sky,"Boy remembers his grandfather in magical, visual tale.","In OCEAN MEETS SKY, Finn recalls conversations with his grandfather ""who would've been ninety years old today"" about “a place far away where ocean meets sky.” Finn builds a boat, falls asleep, and when he wakes up, the boat sails to open sea where Finn meets ""a great golden fish."" The fish has whiskers similar to the grandfather's, and Finn follows the fish to a magical land. Is this where ocean meets sky? As the fish swims toward the moon, Finn hears someone calling him from far away, waking him. It's his mom, who tells him she ""made Grandpa’s dumplings."" Finn looks up at the moon, which now resembles the face of his grandfather smiling down at him.
","Readers are in excellent hands with the Fan Brothers, who here pair their trademark gorgeous art with a family story that's emotionally resonant and comforting. The art in Ocean Meets Sky is entrancing, but the story's also tightly crafted and satisfying. Early on, Finn's shown gazing out the window with a toy boat and framed photo of his grandfather beside him on the ledge. When he flashes back to his grandfather, they're sitting at a table with shells, a pipe, and a carved whale, images that the Fan Brothers bring back during Finn's magical journey. The past is present as the pipe reappears as a cloud, the shells as ""an island of giant shells,"" and the whale floats in the sky as part of Finn's fantastic vision. Astute readers will note that the great golden fish that guides Finn has the same drooping Fu Manchu mustache as his grandfather, as does the smiling moon in the sky. And when his mom wakes him at the end for a dinner of ""Grandpa’s dumplings,"" the cozy family unit feels warm and complete.","Parents need to know that Ocean Meets Sky by the ultra-talented brothers Terry and Eric Fan (The Night Gardener) is a magical story about a young boy of Asian descent remembering his grandfather.

""To honor"" him, Finn builds a boat and sets off on a journey, guided by a golden fish who takes him into magical, seafaring worlds. There's so much gorgeous art to pore over, and the book, entrancing and never didactic, carries the implicit, reassuring message that even though the grandfather's passed on, he's still with Finn, smiling down on him. This beautiful book will stand up to many rereadings and suggests a comforting way for kids to think about lost family members or other loved ones.

Then an unexpected reunion with her long-lost mother opens up entire new worlds nd forces Alosa to deal with her own destructive siren nature before she kills the humans she loves and needs. Complicating matters further: captive/frenemy/hottie/love interest Riden. But no time for all that, as Alosa pursues revenge on her dad, the king follows with a large crew and murderous intent, characters kill and maim one another with gusto. Meanwhile, awaiting their moment: the seductive, lethal sirens. Epic battles, a colossal body count, wild adventure, snarky dialogue, and snarkier narrative soon follow.
","The relentless, gleeful gore may be a deal-breaker for many, but Captain Alosa's return also brings an imaginative mix of snark, crew bonding, romantic tension, and swashbuckling adventure. The hacking, slashing, stabbing, and worse start on the first page of Daughter of the Siren Queen, continuing throughout at a rate more typical of horror tales or violent video games. If you can get past that, though, it's a fun read, with plenty of adventure, romance, and conflict to keep the pages turning.
 ","Parents need to know that Daughter of the Siren Queen, like its previous volume Daughter of the Pirate King, is packed to the gunwales with gleeful, gory, mind-numbing violence from the first sentence, in which protagonist/narrator Alosa slits an unfortunate pirate's throat. Amid the stabbing, slashing, dismemberment, shooting, drowning, and devouring by sea monsters -- and that's all from the good guys, the villains are worse (a villain keeps a character prisoner and rapes her) -- there's also a page-turning, imaginative adventure, a heroine grappling with the challenges of leadership and unwelcome superpowers, and a ridiculously good-looking hero who's also a nice guy. To say nothing of a motley crew that includes ex-thieves, former prostitutes, a hard-drinking pilot, and a knife-wielding 6-year-old.

Don't Let Them Disappear: 12 Endangered Species Across the Globe,Loads of lively animal info and a call to action for kids.,"DON'T LET THEM DISAPPEAR: 12 ENDANGERED SPECIES ACROSS THE GLOBE profiles each animal species, including giraffes, tigers, polar bears, giant pandas, sea otters, blue whales, whale sharks, lions, rhinoceroses, gorillas, orangutans, and elephants.

Green,"Clever color book expands idea of green in nature, at home.","The world is full of many different kinds of green -- at home and in the wild.

The Cabinet of Earths,"American kids find magical, creepy adventure in Paris.","Thirteen-year-old Maya and her little brother, James, are reluctantly uprooted and moved to Paris -- where their mother, who's just beaten cancer, has always wanted to live, and their father has just found a dream job. Once there, Maya begins to suspect there's something more sinister going on than the homesickness and culture clash she feels, as she runs across spooky buildings, mysterious strangers, long-lost relatives, and unexplained events. With the help of her classmate Valko, she soon plunges into a life-changing adventure, and discovers a troubled family history dating back to the French Revolution.
","THE CABINET OF EARTHS gets top marks for skillfully navigating complex emotional territory. It explores the feelings of a girl who has been dealing with her beloved mother's cancer for several years, recognizes that she has no choice but to be a ""good sport"" and move to Paris because that's what her mom, now healthy, wants, and is still utterly miserable because she misses her dog so much. It also scores for an ingenious, thought-provoking premise and a plot with quite a few surprises. Its weakness lies in the fact that it has to convey a significant amount of newly invented cosmology, as well as historical and scientific information, for the plot to make sense. It all comes together by the end, but it may be confusing for some readers along the way.","Parents need to know that this debut from Anne Nesbet, UC Berkeley professor of Russian literature and the history of film (a follow-up is due in 2013), is a great adventure with an imaginative premise, engaging characters, Parisian local color, and an intelligent, nuanced look at family relationships and moral issues. But a few scenes -- particularly one involving convoluted antique machinery that extracts the life force from a child -- are creepy enough to induce nightmares in more sensitive young readers. Also, a good deal of historical, philosophical, and magical information relevant to the plot can become overwhelming.

"Artemis Fowl, Book 1",Witty and exciting series start with irresistible antihero.,"After a jaunt in Ho Chi Min City to steal from a rogue fairy, it's finally his: ARTEMIS FOWL, age 12, millionaire criminal, has a copy of the fairies' sacred book containing all their secrets. With the help of his brilliant mind and some sophisticated computer software, he decodes the book and begins to make his nefarious plan to force the fairies to give up their gold. Stakeouts ensue around ancient oak trees, where fairies need to complete their rites and renew their magic. Poor Captain Holly Short, member of the fairy police LEPrecon Unit, heads to the wrong tree for the ceremony and gets kidnapped by Artemis and his hulking bodyguard, Butler. As the negotiations begin for her release, the fairies with their magic and sophisticated weaponry think they have Artemis easily beat. But they don't know Artemis.
","This witty, exciting series start boasts an irresistible 12-year-old antihero and a host of fantastic characters. There's kidnapped Captain Holly, who's determined to redeem herself; Butler, the perfect assassin who will do anything to protect his sister; overconfident and foolish Commander Root -- and they're all flawed and intriguing with plenty of tricks up their sleeves. Even as the action ratchets up, readers will be torn about whom to root for.
Another wonderful strength of the book is the way the story builds. Most of it takes place in one evening -- magical fairy time stoppage included. Even when a real clock isn't ticking, readers will be biting their nails counting down to the scary ""blue-rinse"" bomb. The big question throughout the action-packed evening: Is Artemis really one step ahead of the fairies or finally in over his head?","Parents need to know that Artemis Fowl is the start of a best-selling series named after a 12-year-old millionaire criminal mastermind who takes on the race of fairies to get their gold. Because of the sophisticated and witty writing style and the complex characters, this is a great choice for adult fantasy fans to read along with kids. Readers on the younger side will dig in for the action. There's plenty of it near the end. A fight with a troll is quite gory: It's a mace and lots of bullets against a hungry behemoth with horns and claws. Earlier in the story there's a kidnapping, some fistfights, explosions, and tranquilizers used. Artemis' bodyguard, Butler, tries not to kill his fairy adversaries. There's some talk about why Artemis is left to his own devices: His father was lost in a boat explosion and feared dead, and afterward his mother stays in her room with a mental illness. Expect a fair amount of cigar smoking by the fairy commander and some drinking. While you're reading along with kids, this book is a great opportunity to talk about antiheroes such as Artemis. He's driven by power and money, and he's devious and sometimes cruel, but there's definitely good there -- just enough that readers may find themselves rooting for him and the fairies at the same time.

From Norvelt to Nowhere,Comical road-trip novel stretches believability.,"FROM NORVELT TO NOWHERE begins with a Halloween murder that occurs shortly after the events of Dead End in Norvelt. The mystery of the murdered elderly ladies that seemed to have been solved in the first book turns out to have new twists, and Jack Gantos (a nonautobiographical character who happens to share the author's name) and Miss Volker are off on a road trip to solve it once and for all. Where Miss Volker sees herself as Ahab (from Moby-Dick) chasing the elusive white whale (the man she claims is the murderer), Jack sees her more as a Jekyll/Hyde: good person who sometimes gives in to evil cravings. The mystery adventure includes shady characters who may be what they seem, a nighttime graveyard showdown, and several incidents involving a whaling harpoon.
","Though From Norvelt to Nowhere shares the same exaggerated tall-tale tone of Newbery-winner Dead End in Norvelt, the story itself is more convoluted and doesn't quite offer the same satisfaction. Twelve-year-old Jack is still as likable as ever, and readers will relate to the joy and freedom he feels as he embarks on a road-trip adventure with only eccentric Miss Volker to guide him, but the story centers mostly on Miss Volker's quest to once and for all resolve the mystery of the murdered old ladies back in Norvelt. Unmoored from the kooky small-town setting, Miss Volker's vacillations over whether she loves or hates ""Spizz,"" the accused murderer, seem too strange to relate to -- she literally tries to kill him for most of the novel, while at the same time wondering if she wants to marry him. Her historical lectures to Jack seem a bit more forced this time around, as do Jack's near-constant attempts to draw real-life parallels to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Moby-Dick. Still, kids who enjoyed the first book or who like silly road-trip antics will enjoy this farcical adventure.","Parents need to know that From Norvelt to Nowhere is Jack Gantos' sequel to the Newbery-winning Dead End in Norvelt, nd, like the first book, it's set in 1962. Here, 12-year-old protagonist Jack tries to help his best friend, the elderly Miss Volker, enforce her own justice on a man she thinks is a murderer, going on a road trip with her to sort it all out. Miss Volker carries a handgun in her purse that accidentally goes off (but no one's hurt), and later she acquires a whaling harpoon that she throws at a man in a car. The violence is more cartoony than scary, and Miss Volker struggles to overcome her own harmful urges.

Be Prepared,"Smart, funny account of summer camp discomfort.","At the beginning of BE PREPARED, 9-year-old Vera wants nothing more than to go off to summer camp, even if it's one that emphasizes Russian language and traditions. She's not prepared, however, for outhouses, swarms of bugs, mean tent-mates, or hiking in the rain. Gradually, Vera learns to stick up for herself and reach out to people who want to be her friend.
","There are plenty of tales of summer camp hijinks, but few capture the experience with such awkward hilarity as this keenly observed graphic novel. Vera Brosgol puts her own unique spin on Be Prepared. depicting her struggle to fit in at a sleepaway camp for speakers of Russian. She depicts the semi-sadistic antics of the mean girls, the inscrutability of the daily lessons, the horror of the outhouses. The dialogue rings true, and the artwork says in a few panels more than many storytellers achieve in a page or more. Summer camp stories usually follow a prescribed template, but Be Prepared forgoes the usual path and strikes off into new territory. Highly recommended.","Parents need to know that Be Prepared is a nonfiction graphic novel memoir by Russian-born Vera Brosgol (Anya's Ghost), who moved to the United States when she was 5.

Conspiracy of Blood and Smoke,"Less mystery, more romance as Hitler consolidates power.","Having escaped Hitler's clutches in Prisoner of Night and Fog, Gretchen and Daniel have been hiding in England under assumed names for the past 18 months. In the meantime, Hitler has risen to national prominence in Germany and been named chancellor. Events there draw Daniel back to Germany, this time to Berlin, where he's been falsely accused of murder. Gretchen soon follows to help, despite the danger of being recognized as one of Hitler's former favorites. Can they find the real killer, clear Daniel's name, escape Hitler's notice, and get back out of Germany safely?
","The historical events that serve as a backdrop provide a lot of food for thought, and the lively, engaging characters and compelling events will draw teens in and keep the pages turning. Suspense, particularly in the stronger second half, is surprisingly well maintained despite the reader knowing that one of the heroes' main objectives (bringing down Hitler) is doomed to fail.
CONSPIRACY OF BLOOD AND SMOKE has a lot of the same strengths as its prequel, Prisoner of Night and Fog: danger, excitement, and relatable characters grappling with coming of age at a crucial turning point in history. But added melodrama (finding the real killer will bring down the National Socialist Party and disgrace Hitler) weaken the structure; the murder mystery becomes less compelling as it's swept up into other events; nd phrases such as ""the familiar feel of his lips on hers"" make it read more like a romance.
 ","Parents need to know that Conspiracy of Blood and Smoke continues the story, begun in Prisoner of Night and Fog, of a girl who grew up a favorite pet of Adolf Hitler. The author catches the reader up on past events quickly, but it'll be enjoyed better by those who've read the first book. It's a good way to get teens thinking about the causes of World War II, especially about how the National Socialist Party became so strong nd how Hitler acquired dictatorial powers. A lot of beatings are described briefly, some guns are fired, blood's mentioned but not described in detail, and once injuries from torture are described in detail. Kisses and sensations of attraction are described briefly. Young women working as prostitutes take cocaine as an escape, and a close friend of the protagonist uses habitually.

"Operation Fireball: Fish Finelli, Book 2",Clever underdog sparkles in winning adventure.,"Fish Finelli desperately wants to win the Captain Kid Classic boat race -- for bragging rights, sure, but also to finally put sneering Bryce Billings in his place. He's sure he can skillfully handle the Fireball, an old whaler he and his friends have been fixing up, but his best effort might not be enough to win against Bryce's powerful (and expensive) Viper. But Fish has some solid advantages: ingenuity, know-how, and helpful friends. But he's so focused on going head to head with his rival, he's startled to discover on race day that there's a dark horse in the running.
","OPERATION FIREBALL, the second book starring the engaging Fish Finelli, has a slightly old-fashioned style but feels fresh and fun. Fish is easy to relate to, the kind of kid anyone would want as a friend. Given so many books centered on tween boys who chafe at school, it's refreshing to have a protagonist who's capable, smart, and very likable: His tendency to delve into facts and explanations is never show-offy, and his friends enjoy him. The only sour note is the use of a pudgy boy who snacks constantly as an easy comic target.
Jason Beene's full-page grayscale artwork and illustrated sidebars will help win over readers reluctant to dive into text-heavy chapter books. The story's ending sets up the next installment: Fish vows to enter a reputed haunted house to prove his bravery.","Parents need to know that Operation Fireball is a feel-good chapter book perfect for reluctant readers, particularly boys. Fish Finelli is smart and grounded, finding everyday adventure with loyal friends. Class friction underlies the central conflict, which is driven by a bully who's more of a taunting rival than a menacing threat.

She becomes trapped in the drudgery of her own family's textile mill. Still good history although the plot's a potboiler. Fans of the first two books will want to read it.
 ","Ann Rinaldi strains to concoct a plot that will bring the quilt and the family back together, and relies on remarkable coincidences to keep the story moving.
This last book in the Chelmsford sisters trilogy, following Stitch in Time and Broken Days, reunites the family and their pieces of quilt that the first two books divided. Wild coincidences abound.

"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe: The Chronicles of Narnia, Book 1","Classic Narnia tale has exciting battles, Christian themes.","In THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, the four Pevensie siblings -- Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy -- discover that a wardrobe in an old country house is a portal to the magical land of Narnia. There, Edmund meets the evil White Witch and is lured into betraying his siblings, but the plot fails. Meanwhile, the lion Aslan, lord of Narnia, returns to the land, heralding the end of the Witch's long, joyless winter; the children, who continue to elude the Witch's grasp, meet with him. Before their adventure is done, they'll face fierce battle, devastating loss, and glorious triumph, all while learning lessons about faith, forgiveness, and more.
","Anyone who's ever dreamed of living in a world where animals can talk is going to enjoy the Pevensies' Narnian escapades. Originally published in 1950, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is full of storyteller's asides and precious English children, with a mix of adventure and serious battles. Those who know the story is full of Christian allegory (spoiler alert! Aslan sacrifices himself for the wayward Edmund and is resurrected) are likely to spot it everywhere, but some children may simply enjoy the book's fairy-tale aspects. Yes, perhaps the forces of good sometimes seem to have too easy a time vanquishing their foes, and, yes, the writing style is now somewhat dated, but this is still a classic series that young fantasy fans will thoroughly enjoy.","Parents need to know that the The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is the first book published in C.S. Lewis' classic Chronicles of Narnia series, which children have loved for generations. Lewis, a devout Christian, weaves lots of Christian allegory into the book (and the series as a whole), but the story can be enjoyed on many levels, by all kinds of readers. Expect several violent scenes, including a large battle (axes, clubs, and more are used, and characters are injured and die) and -- spoiler alert! -- the tense, scary, sad death of a major character. Creepy, evil creatures are also described; their leader is the White Witch, who is cruel and shows no mercy. The main characters are clear role models who valiantly help save Narnia from the Witch; even the one who initially falls under her sway learns his lesson, showing the power of repentance and forgiveness. The book was adapted for a movie in 1988 and again for the blockbuster 2005 film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. An excellent audiobook version is narrated by British actor Michael York.

Never Let Me Go,"Gripping sci-fi paints teens' bleak, unforgettable world.","Now a young woman, Kathy reflects on her life as a child and as a teen at Hailsham, the exclusive English boarding school she attended. She recalls the intimate relationships she forged with Ruth, whose lies tested their friendship, and Tommy, a troubled and sensitive outcast. Over time, the three central characters uncover the truth about their guardians, their fate, and what they mean to each other.
","Readers are kept on very much the same footing as the central characters; we experience the same kind of suspense as the dark, disturbing reality they face unfolds, and it's gripping. As he famously proved in his Man Booker Award-winning novel Remains of the Day (1989), Ishiguro is a master of restraint; he holds back just enough to create emotional tension, so even his least eventful plots become page-turners. Though Never Let Me Go is not a masterpiece on the order of Remains, it is thought-provoking nd creates a fully realized, horrific, unforgettable world.","Parents need to know that Never Let Me Go is set in a highly disturbing sci-fi reality in which young people try to make sense of their relationships and an increasingly hopeless world. The author introduces a host of invented, unnatural roles: students, guardians, careers, and donors, and slowly reveals what these labels mean. However, most of the interpersonal situations that crop up are fairly believable, typical adolescent scenarios, and tween and teen readers may identify with the central characters. Though this book, by one of England's most acclaimed living novelists, was written for an adult audience, the teen and young adult characters make it appealing to younger readers, and the prose is simple and straightforward enough to make it accessible to readers aged 12 and up. However, some parents may feel the book's sexual content is too strange for pre-teen readers. A film version of Never Let Me Go received positive reviews when it was released in 2010 (out on video in 2011), but was rightfully called very dark and depressing.

But then Lance and his gaming partner -- whom he knows only by his screen name MrsKeller -- are drawn through the game into the real 11th-dimensional world upon which the game is based. There they meet each other and TheGreatOne, who forces them into a quest before they can return home. But he may not be telling the truth, and Lance finds himself turning into his online character -- a flesh-eating zombie.
","This is the children's lit equivalent of a B movie. The story doesn't make much sense, the characters are cardboard, and the gore is mostly gratuitous, but it's enjoyable enough in a cheesy sort of way. One can imagine it done with cheap sets and visible zippers on the costumes. It has its share of scares (though not as scary as you might expect) and cliffhangers (including the ending), and passes the time agreeably if you or your kids are into this sort of thing.

	Early on there are long stretches of transcriptions of video game play, which will be entertaining for kids who love this type of video game, and not so much for anyone else. Once Lance and MrsKeller have entered the world of Discordia for real, it still reads like a video game, as presumably it was intended to. So ... not great, not terrible, a bit of gratuitous gore but otherwise mostly harmless. This is one of those books that some kids will love, and if they are not normally avid readers, their parents and teachers will sigh and say, ""Well, as long as they're reading ...""
	 ","Parents need to know that this is the start of a science fiction series, and there is quite a bit of graphic fantasy violence. The main teen character is becoming a zombie and has the urge to eat living creatures and people. This series may appeal to reluctant readers -- especially those who play games -- but parents should know there is an actual online game attached to these books.

Valentine Princess: A Princess Diaries Book,V-Day romance fluff for Princess series fans.,"Sixteen-year-old Princess Mia is sitting in her limo about to travel to Genovia for the summer. That's when she discovers her journal from one and a half years ago and finds the section about Valentine's Day with her boyfriend Michael. He does not believe in the holiday, while she finds it a special time to express how she feels about him. Friends offer input, agreeing and disagreeing. In the meantime, her Princess lessons with her Grandmere have stopped as her Grandmere has developed a friendship with a mystic Dr. Steve and has disappeared, except for appearances on talk shows.
","This is basically fun fluff that will be hard for readers to put down. Hugely successful author Meg Cabot has cornered the market on writing for female tweens, having created a character that is very relatable as a gawky high school student yet fulfills young girls' fantasies of being a princess. This volume in the series is also written as journal entries. In VALENTINE PRINCESS Mia is actually rereading a diary from a year and a half before her first Valentine's Day with her boyfriend Michael.
Mia's a good kid at heart with strong morals and resistance to peer pressure, but there's not much here in the way of substance or tough challenges for her to face, making her a less relatable and engaging character and this series less meaningful.","Parents need to know that there's prolific mention of name brands, usage of teenage jargon ""like"" and ""she was all,"" and discussion of first romantic encounters. There are references to sidecar drinks, flat and big-chested girls, losing virginity on prom night, and kids using the drug Ecstasy. While this book appeals to younger tweens, the princess' teen issues are a better fit for readers 12 and up.

I Am Princess X,"Friendship tale, graphics blend well in absorbing mystery.","Best friends in fifth grade, May and Libby become obsessed with writing and illustrating their story about Princess X, a katana-wielding, high-top-wearing princess out to save her kingdom. But Libby and her mother die in a car crash, and all the work Libby and May did on Princess X gets thrown out by LIbby's father. Years later, May is turning 17. While back in Seattle visiting her father, she starts to see Princess X graffiti and stickers around town. A bit more digging reveals a popular Web comic about Princess X, with details about the story only May and Libby could know. To find out the truth about Libby and who's behind the Web comic, May will have to dodge the Needle Man, enlist the help of a hacker, and trust the mysterious Jackdaw.
","This YA debut from veteran author Cheri Priest is an engaging, absorbing mystery with comic-book illustrations that weave an intriguing, original fantasy element into the story. The mystery is compelling and unfolds in entertaining ways, thanks to the solid writing, colorful but believable characters, and the illustrations.
The illustration style is a bit childlike, but it adds realism to the idea that it's a comic written and drawn by talented, if inexperienced, teens. Heroine May's voice is believable, and kids will relate to her determination never to give up on her friendship or her search for the truth.","Parents need to know that I Am Princess X is a YA debut from the veteran adult author of Boneshaker. It's a traditional novel with sections of comic-book illustrations weaving a fantasy element into the story.

Maximum Ride 3: Saving the World and Other Extreme Sports,Flabby finale to senseless yet exciting series.,"Max and the Flock have escaped from the evil scientists. Again. After some more fighting, being captured, and escaping, they end up with Ari on their side, which causes them to split up. Max, along with Nudge and Angel, are finally led by the Voice to Germany -- but only after it leads them to England and France, for no apparent reason. But then you know how these Deep Throat types are -- they never tell you anything straight out.
So after some European site-seeing, they find the Itex master headquarters, where they are ... captured again! There the evil corporation is having some sort of pep rally/gladiator bout, in which Max is to be the feature attraction. Good thing Fang has been keeping that blog.
","To his catalog of empty thrills and nearly plotless to-ing and fro-ing, author James Patterson adds something new -- a series of pointless plot twists. The long-awaited climax turns out to be pretty much a joke and doesn't even succeed in tying up the loose ends.
The book's ending suggests the author is hoping to continue the series (at the end of the second book, he actually asked readers to vote on it). Well, for an utterly pointless series that makes no sense at all, that, at least, makes perfect sense. When you're making tons of money, why stop?","Parents need to know that the violence level is about the same as the previous two books, so if your kids have read this far, more won't hurt.

The Secret Garden,Beautiful classic filled with magic and realism.,"Two cousins -- one motherless, the other an orphan -- are so monstrously spoiled that no one can stand them and they can hardly stand themselves. With the help of a boy of the moors and some natural magic, they discover an abandoned garden and return it to abundance. As the garden grows the children grow -- into their own better selves.
","If you think a book from 1911 might be too stodgy to interest children, think again. Children like Frances Burnett's ability to tell the truth about her characters without condemning them. Mistress Mary, quite contrary, ""was a self-absorbed child,"" and Colin ""thought the whole world belonged to him."" But Burnett makes it clear that these children have been raised without their parents' love.
Children will first be caught by the mysterious world that unfolds, and then comforted to see Colin and Mary reclaim themselves, with a little help from Mother Nature and kind friends. Burnett sets a tone balanced between unflinching realism and high optimism -- not too hard, not too soft.","Parents need to know that this beautifully written book shows two selfish, disagreeable children transformed by the magic of nature and their own imaginations as they work to bring a near-dead garden back to life.

The Summer I Learned to Fly,Touching coming-of-age story with some mature themes.,"When Drew spends the summer working at her mother's new cheese shop, she befriends the strange boy who has been eating the leftover food she leaves in the alley behind the store. She has her own complications in life -- including an unrequited crush on an older boy and a mother who seems to be dating again -- but as she learns Emmett's darker secrets, she puts everything on the line for him, risking her relationship with her mother and sacrificing something she really loves.
","The author weaves together many elements to create this tender coming-of-age story. There's the cheese shop, her mother's new mysterious boyfriend, the journal she finds left behind by her dead father, the accident that leaves her crush disabled, Emmett's family tragedy, his quest to find a miracle, and more -- not to mention Drew's many names -- she's also sometimes Robin or Birdie. But the author handles this material expertly, using these varied elements to create Drew's vivid world, and help readers understand her sometimes dangerous choices. Readers may have a hard time believing how emotionally vulnerable the young characters are with each other at times, but they will still be moved by the obvious love they share, especially Drew and Emmett, who learn what it takes to be true friends.  ","Parents need to know that the protagonist in this coming-of-age story is a 13-year-old girl who sometimes makes dangerous decisions. Not only does she befriend a runaway teen and hangs out with his friends who smoke and squat in an abandoned barn, but she also sneaks out of her room at night to help Emmett on a quest, and steals money from her mother's cheese shop. But her heart is in the right place; Drew is learning to be a friend, and along the way learning to make her own choices -- and to believe that miracles do happen, even if they happen slowly.

Ballpark Mysteries Series,Bro and sis solve fun mysteries in major-league ballparks.,"In the BALLPARK MYSTERIES series, Kate and her cousin Mike go to each major league ballpark with her parents, a sports reporter and a baseball scout -- which explains the kids' VIP access to players, parks, and managers. In every city, in every park, there's a mystery -- something is missing, something was stolen, someone is too secretive -- and the two kids try to solve the mysteries while enjoying the city's sights and, of course, watching a ballgame. At the end of every book is a bunch of trivia about the city, team, and ballpark so young fans can read up on their favorite places and maybe learn something new about their hometown ballpark.
","This is a surprisingly good series; the mysteries aren't formulaic, the vocabulary and lessons are simple -- great for readers of early chapter books -- and the stories are fun. The mysteries aren't always about a lost item or a crime; sometimes they're more about figuring out the best way to help someone. From kayaks in McCovey Cove (at San Francisco's AT&T Park) to a carousel in Detroit to a hotel inside the ballpark in Toronto and more, the cool aspects of each ballpark are fun parts of each story, and trivia buffs will dig into all the details.
The Ballpark Mysteries Series effortlessly normalizes gender equality: Kate's mom being a female sports reporter is never called out, she's simply going to work and bringing Kate and Mike along, and Kate and Mike love baseball equally. It's refreshing when equality is normal, and girls who often feel that baseball books are written for boys will likely feel differently about these.","Parents need to know that David A. Kelly's Ballpark Mysteries series is an upbeat bunch of whodunits for baseball fans of all ages. Readers will enjoy solving mysteries with Kate and Mike, and parents reading aloud will enjoy the ballpark trivia specific to the location in each book. The two baseball-junkie kids never face any true danger while they're sleuthing, and their days are filled with jokes, ballpark adventures, and earnest quests to discover the truth. The lessons in these books go beyond the academic: The star of one baseball team almost quits because he thinks he's a disappointment to his dad, but Kate and Mike set him straight -- surprisingly deep emotions for an early reader book. These books are about baseball, but gender stereotypes are nowhere to be found here. In a lovely detail for Little League fans, author David A. Kelly dedicated one of his books to pitcher Mo'Ne Davis, the first girl to win a Little League World Series game and to pitch a LLWS shutout. This series is a great choice for both boys and girls.

","Dayle Ann Dodd has the timing of a stand-up comedian, and Kyrsten Brooker ccents it all with her masterful artwork. Together, parent and child can have fun chanting the repeating parts while searching the vibrant collages that fill the pages. Kids, especially those who resist going to bed at night, will enjoy this story, and parents will love reading it aloud, over and over again as they put their own reluctant sleeper to bed.
Coming up with a bedtime routine that works smoothly is certainly not a new theme in children's literature, nor a new challenge in real life. Most parents are quite familiar with the problem, and most have searched for book after book to soothe their restless sleepers. Happily, here is one more bedtime book that is well worth reading. THE PRINCE WON'T GO TO BED is a wonderfully artistic, funny, poetic bedtime book that presents a lighthearted look at a bedtime ritual gone wrong. Kids will love its rhyming, rhythmic language, the pacing, and the playful repetition of phrases as one scenario after another fails to calm the Prince and the ""Waa! Waa! Waa's"" begin anew.","Parents need to know that there is nothing controversial or unpleasant to detract from this playful, rhyming story.

The City of Ember,"Part fantasy, part mystery, part treasure hunt.","Ember is a city in eternal darkness, only kept light by its increasingly unreliable electric system. Other systems are falling apart as well, and stockpiles of food and essentials that have lasted hundreds of years are running out. The city was only meant to last 220 years, and now it has been 241. But the instructions the Builders left have been lost and forgotten.
Lina finds them, but not before her baby sister has chewed them into virtual indecipherability. Now she and her friend Doon must figure them out from the few disjointed letters left, before the city falls apart. Their efforts lead them to discover long forgotten secrets about the nature and purpose of Ember, and what the Builders intended. They want to share their discoveries with the rest of the citizens -- but only if the corrupt mayor and his guards don't stop them first.
","Part dystopian fantasy, part mystery, part code-breaking treasure hunt, this is an intriguing story. Deciphering the clues from the damaged Instructions will keep readers guessing, despite some predictable plot twists in the center section, and they will be rooting for the appealing main characters.
While lacking the complexity or moral ambiguity of The Giver, THE CITY OF EMBER has its own unique features: It's a city designed not to be a utopia, but rather to hold the remnants of humanity safe and isolated for a fixed period, then release them. The problem comes when the release doesn't happen, no one knows that it should have, and the city is past its expiration date. A fascinating scenario -- and one fraught with possibilities for the sequel.","Parents need to know that City of Ember is an engrossing sci-fi fantasy that features appealing main characters and an intriguing mystery.

The Serpent King,"Poignant story of friends, faith, first love in rural South.","Set in rural Tennessee, THE SERPENT KING follows three misfit best friends who stand out in their otherwise homogenous small town of Forrestville, Tennessee, for a variety of reasons. Lydia is a precocious, relatively wealthy ""Internet-famous"" fashion blogger with college-educated parents and a big-city future; Travis is linebacker-sized, but instead of being a football player like his father and dead brother he carries a staff and obsesses about a fantasy series; and singer-songwriter Dill is named after his snake-handling preacher of a father, who's in prison for having a secret stash of online child pornography. As their senior year begins, they each deal with having one foot in school and one in the quickly approaching future. Travis finds romance on a fan site's message boards, his only escape from an abusive home life; Lydia devotes herself to sustaining her blog -- her ticket to NYU; and Dill struggles with his soul-crushing fundamentalist parents, as well as the impending doom that Lydia, with whom he's not-so-secretly in love, will go away for good at the end of the year.
","Heartbreaking and heartfelt, this gorgeously written coming-of-age novel is an authentic look at life in a rural town for three teens trying to escape the weight of poverty, abuse, nd prejudice. It's no surprise that debut author Jeff Zentner is also a professional musician -- a guitarist, singer, and songwriter -- because the language is lush and lyrical, with angsty Dill in particular being a thinker of deep philosophical musings about his poisoned bloodline, his overwhelming and seemingly unrequited love for Lydia, and his changing faith. Lydia isn't perfect; she's a bit of a cultural snob who can't wait to flee to the streets of New York City with worldly young fashionistas and celebrities who follow her popular blog Dollywould (after her idol and fellow Tennesseean Dolly Parton). But she also knows how lucky she is to have found Dill and Travis and how their friendship saved her from being a lonely outcast (her professional parents are considerably more well off than most in Forrestville). Lydia's flaws make her that much more realistic, just as Travis' impressive size belies a geeky devotion to a Game of Thrones-like fandom, and a gentleness with his mama create a character who's so unique and lovable that you'll ache for him when his father hurls insults his way.  Despite the alternating third-person points of view among the three best friends, the title and the story ultimately belong to Dill. Plagued with a name belonging to a grandfather and a father who've both surrendered to darkness (grief in his grandfather's case; faith and child pornography in his father's case), only child Dill is crushed by the bleakness of his future. His put-upon mother demands that he take a full-time job to settle his father's considerable legal fees, making sure to assert that it's his duty to honor his parents and pay off their debts. Meanwhile, at least fanboy Travis has Amelia and his books for escape, and Lydia has a future being a young fashion maven. Dill's existential ennui and depression at the thought of losing Lydia takes up a lot of space in the story, but don't despair -- hope is there in the form of  song and a touch. Zentner's story is at times difficult to read, but even in the darkest of moments, the unconditional friendship among Dill, Lydia, and Travis is full of light, love, and laughter.","Parents need to know that The Serpent King is a realistic contemporary novel by musician-turned-novelist Jeff Zentner. The heartrending story focuses on three high school seniors and best friends in rural Tennessee: They're unpopular but intelligent, creative, caring, and loyal to one another. The book deals with mature subjects such as domestic abuse, poverty, grief, religious fundamentalism, imprisoned parents, nd the idea that for some teens, college doesn't seem like an option. The three main characters all use social media for different means: to express themselves creatively, to connect with other hard-core fans of a favorite book series, and to break stereotypes about rural kids not having any style. There's some violence, including an armed robbery, fistfights, domestic abuse by a husband and father, and references to a couple of deaths -- one a suicide, one a murder -- as well as occasional strong language (""s--t,"" ""a--hole,"" ""f--k,"" racial slurs and insults). The romance is slow-burning, and the themes are thought-provoking and ideal for parent-teen conversations about everything from college to faith to social media use to first love.

"Slayer, Book 1",Uneven series start picks up when Buffy TV series ends.,"In SLAYER, Athena knew something was different the moment the end times were thwarted and all the demon portals closed. Her chronic asthma ceased and she felt really strong and restless all the time. When a hellhound finds Athena and the remaining Watchers hiding out in Ireland, she acts before she can think, snapping its neck with her bare hands. Now everyone knows who she's become, including her twin sister Artemis, the one everyone thought would be the next chosen Slayer. When Athena's old crush, Leo, and his mom show up and want to train her to fight, Athena's mom refuses to let her. As she begins to train without Mom's permission, that's just the first of Athena's many secrets. A demon shows up in the woods, injured and unconscious, and Athena overrides her new Slayer instincts to kill him. She tries to save him instead.
","Buffy fans may find the start to this homage YA series a fun indulgence at first, but the storytelling, like the newest Slayer, lacks a clear direction. Most of the problem lies in main character Athena's inner story. Athena is upset about her relationship with her sister, with her mother who favors her sister, with the death of her father years before, with Buffy for getting them all into this mess, with her new powers that don't match who she thought she was, with the cute guy she was humiliated in front of, and the girl who humiliated her. And she's not trained to fight or think of herself as strong or someone who makes good decisions. These are all good things for a character to work out -- but not in a jumble all at once. It makes the big shifts in the story at the end seem as jumbled as her thinking.
Slayer, because it references Buffy the TV series and the character often, also takes too long to launch in its own direction. Buffy was best left behind a few chapters in. Here's hoping this great YA author, Kiersten White, finds her footing with this series and steers it in a clearer direction for Book 2.","Parents need to know that Slayer is the first book from the world of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series and movie written by longtime Buffy fan/bestselling author Kiersten White (And I Darken trilogy).  It helps to have watched the TV series to keep up with some of the characters and lore that pop up throughout the story. Expect demon-against-Slayer violence with many demons ending up dead (some by decapitation). Humans who die do so more quietly, in their sleep. Trauma from the past bubbles up often: the loss of a father and many family friends, a house fire, a girl whipped by own mother. Caged demons are tortured, with one slowly skinned alive. Other mature content stays pretty mild: a bar scene with some beers, some minor swearing, a couple of kisses, straight and LGBTQ. When the main character, Athena, discovers she has supernatural abilities as a Slayer, she doesn't forget that she's lways been a healer and protector. She tries to find a way to be both.

Loud Awake and Lost,Teen aims to recover memories in mature psychological tale.,"Seventeen-year-old Ember has come back to her parents' home in an affluent Brooklyn neighborhood after being hospitalized for eight months in the wake of a terrible car accident she doesn't remember. Her mom, dad, and longtime friends are overjoyed to have her back, and her ex wants to get back together. But she soon realizes that there's quite a bit they're not telling her about the weeks leading up to the accident, of which she has no memory -- in particular, anything about the young man who was killed when Ember was driving. Before long, she's drawn to places she can't recall that seem strangely familiar -- and a boy who appears and vanishes as she tries to find the truth and her own path in life.
","LOUD AWAKE AND LOST covers less toxic territory than author Adele Griffin's recent All You Never Wanted, and the characters, while flawed, are more appealing. Some readers will find Ember's psychological odyssey so compelling that they'll immediately start again from the beginning to pick up the hints pointing to the resolution. Others will find the wanderings through her own mind so convoluted that they give up or wonder whether the conclusion's a sufficient payoff for all the angst. Teens who like cooking, dance, or New York will get lots of interesting detail.","Parents need to know that although Loud Awake and Lost isn't nearly as dark and nasty as author Adele Griffin's last YA outing, All You Never Wanted, it deals with mature issues, from the aftermath of a fatal car accident to troubled relationships. Some readers will be thrilled by narrator Ember's wanderings through the labyrinth of her own mind in search of the truth, including true love; others may find it too much effort. Ember routinely lies to her parents and is physically intimate with two boys, although they don't have sex; much of her behavior's driven by her efforts to remember a part of her life before the accident in which she was badly injured and a mysterious young man died. There's a bit of underage drinking, crude language, and many mentions of commercial products, which serve mostly as scene setting.

Whisper to Me,Riveting mystery surrounds teen who hears voice in her head.,"Walking on the beach in the summer between junior and senior years, Cass discovers a human foot that's washed ashore -- which is more than enough to rattle anybody, but the town of Oakwood, New Jersey, has a serial killer on the loose, and Cass fears the foot may belong to one of his victims. Now Cass hears a voice when no one's around, and the voice is not nice. It curses, tells her she's worthless, and, worst of all, makes her hurt herself.  Eventually she's hospitalized and given drug treatments, and she finds a support group for people who hear voices. As her newly learned coping strategies are starting to help, her best friend mysteriously disappears, and Cass fears the worst. At the same time, her budding romance with a cute guy in town for the summer starts to fall apart. Afraid of losing him, Cass tries to hide what she's going through and ends up digging herself into a deeper and deeper hole. But he's the only one she wants to WHISPER TO ME, so if she finally comes clean, will he forgive all the lies and the hurt?
","Nick Lake takes on quite a lot with this story of a teen's struggle with mental illness, and he's more than up to the task. There's plenty here to keep the pages turning: mysteries including a serial killer, past trauma, a dad with PTSD, and a missing friend; the intriguing, sometimes harrowing exploration of Cass' struggle against the voice that tells her to hurt herself; and, of course, the budding romance. Lake balances all these aspects, keeping the plot moving nd seamlessly shifting from one to another without short-changing any.
Cass' utterly believable narrative voice creates a likable, relatable protagonist who destigmatizes mental problems and could encourage the estimated 10 percent of teens who experience them by assuring us all that it can get better with help.","Parents need to know that Whisper to Me, by Printz Award-winning author Nick Lake (In Darkness), tells the story of a teen learning to cope with mental illness. After she finds a human foot on the beach, Cass starts to hear a voice that curses at her, puts her down, and threatens to harm her loved ones if she doesn't hurt herself. It's a harrowing journey at times, but the ending is hopeful. It'll get teens thinking about how the mind copes with trauma, provide insights, and help lessen the ""crazy"" stigma. It also sends strong positive messages about how different kinds of treatment and strategies can help, to keep trying until you find what works for you, and that it will get better. The plot also involves some mystery around a missing friend and a serial killer who's murdering sex workers. Past traumas are described mentioning blood but no other gore. Sexual content is infrequent with a few kisses, but the best friend (a few years older) is a stripper who poses nude online.

Facing a ravaged face, the need to wear a plastic face mask for at least a year, and the suspicion that her mother was at fault in the accident, Kelley begins to withdraw from the world, at first lapsing into silence, then refusing to return to school. Her mother, wracked with guilt and facing severe financial difficulties, doesn't know what to do. But her older sister, returning from France to spend the summer tutoring her, may have some ideas.
","Priscilla Cummings understands many important things. Her first novel, Autumn Journey, was a complex, lyrical, and powerfully emotional tale. This one takes a complex and powerfully emotional situation and renders it in straightforward, no-nonsense, unembellished prose. Clearly she's an author who knows when to let the material speak for itself.
While not shying away from the grimmer aspects of Kelley's treatment, such as the peeling off of the burned skin, she does so in a delicate, careful way that shows she clearly understands what upper elementary and middle school children can handle. And she understands her characters, too. There are no nasty insensitive peers or strangers or other author tricks to cultivate the reader's sympathy for Kelley -- in fact, no villains at all. Just the long, hard slog of a loving family working their way back from disaster.","Parents need to know that this is a delicate but realistic look at the ordeal of a burn victim, and it's an especially valuable story for burn victims and their friends and families. The car accident that causes Kelley's injuries is violent, to be sure; but it's not described in overly graphic detail. Still, your children might need help processing it.

Jazz on a Saturday Night,Kids will groove to this toe-tapping treasure.,"On one fictional Saturday night, eight great jazz musicians get together for an evening of be-bopping magic. Each one, from Miles Davis to Ella Fitzgerald, in his or her turn, jumps in to the mix, and before long the whole room is feeling the beat.
","Inspired by their life-long love of jazz, illustrators Leo and Diane Dillon have put together their dream team of musicians to create ""an evening of jazz immortality."" In be-bopping language and poster-like illustrations, they capture the excitement and energy that such a session might create. Anyone new to the jazz form, or even the veteran, is sure to catch their enthusiasm.
In a perfectly balanced collage of sound and sight, jazz comes alive in award-winning artwork. Painted in what might be called a graphic style, some scenes focus on the musicians themselves, who with eyes closed, seem to be playing or singing from the soul. Others show an audience whose members are jumping, jiving, and otherwise pulled into the captivating music that flows around them like ""a river of melody sketched in dim light."" Everyone is having a good time, and the reader will, too. True to form, the Dillons have created another masterpiece to join the other award-winning books in their oeuvre.","Parents need to know that kids will be drawn in by this exciting rhyming introduction to ""America's classical music"" and its pioneers.

Killing Time in Crystal City,Gritty tale of teen runaway connecting with homeless kids.,"When readers meet KILLING TIME IN CRYSTAL CITY's protagonist Kevin, he's on the bus to Crystal City. A shy runaway who introduces himself as Kiki, he explains that his dad is responsible for the cast on his arm. In the working-class town, he stays at his mostly absent -- and criminal -- uncle's house, trying to fit in with the homeless young people he hangs out with on Crystal City's so-called beach. He especially wants to spend time with strong Stacey, who looks out for him and other urchins. But, although he may be living without any adult supervision, it's clear that he has a different life nd resources than the other kids. This becomes more obvious s flashbacks reveal what actually happened to drive him away from home to begin with -- and what he still needs to face. ","Kiki's  likable misfit, and readers will enjoy his good-hearted bumbling. (In one scene, he trips a bad man who's chasing a girl, using his whole body: ""I might not be a superhero, but I can fall down like nobody's business,"" he says). Readers also will like his best friend Jasper, whom they learn about in flashbacks; Jasper gives Kiki a hard time -- and the nickname that he initially hates --  but he's lso there when Kiki needs him, including helping him see the flaws in his own thinking.
Unfortunately, many of the other secondary characters seem rather two-dimensional, including Stacey -- a tough but golden-hearted girl from the streets who moves on ""when I feel like I have saved somebody"" -- and Kiki's criminal uncle, who prepares elaborate meals in his clean house but is unflinching about murder. These characters keep readers from investing enough in Kiki's world to really connect with his adventure nd understand what he's learning along the way.","Parents need to know that Chris Lynch's Killing Time in Crystal City is bout a teen runaway named Kiki who stays with his criminal uncle but looks for his tribe among homeless kids. It includes some gritty material: Young characters drink and smoke marijuana and cigarettes. Two male friends hook up after a night of drinking rum that one boy's mother gave him. Kiki has a broken arm he claims his father is responsible for. A man is stabbed to death during a robbery. A man beats up his young girlfriend, who shows up at Kiki's house with a bruised face. A girl offers to have sex with Kiki to pay him back for giving her a place to shower and sleep. There's frequent strong language (""bastard,"" ""d--k,"" ""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""bitch,"" ""crap,"" and so on), and there are conversations bout masturbation, a girl who sleeps around, and men hooking up with men. Kiki finds porn on his dad's computer and implies his family broke up because of his dad's repeated cheating. Ultimately, there is a message here about the importance of facing people whom you love -- and who love you – to try to work things out.

Theodore Boone: The Accused,Exciting series gets personal with Boone accused of theft.,"Theodore Boone is accused of theft and is the No. 1 suspect of the Strattenburg police. To make matters worse, someone is slashing his bike tires and messing with his locker. With his comfortable life turned upside down, Theodore is forced to take matters into his own hands. He turns to his black-sheep Uncle Ike, who comes up with a possibly unethical plan to prove Theodore's innocence. This is the third book in the Theodore Boone series, following Kid Lawyer and The Abduction.
","This plot-driven legal thriller will keep readers guessing until the end. Continuing the Theodore Boone tradition, author John Grisham weaves lessons on the law into a page turner. Theodore becomes much more real in this third novel because he's at the center of the plot -- victimized, with his reputation on the line, and forced to make some hard decisions. His knowledge of the law still helps him, but he must also rely on friends.
Grisham makes the law easy to understand by applying it to issues that tweens and teens can relate to: divorce, cyber-security, and privacy at school. These thought-provoking issues give readers something to ponder, and Grisham doesn't give any easy answers. Although the topics are heavy, Grisham's fast-pasted style keeps readers engaged.","Parents need to know that Theodore Boone: The Accused is the third novel in the series by John Grisham nd ddresses issues that affect tweens and teens: computer hacking, divorce, bullying, and Internet safety. Theodore doesn't always seek help from his parents when he's in trouble, and he lets his uncle talk him into doing some questionable investigating. The dilemmas he faces are appropriate for tweens and teens but not for younger kids, who might not get the nuances when Theodore faces issues that don't have clear right or wrong answers. Although most adults are portrayed as helpful, the detectives who investigate Theodore aren't. There's not much violence, but Theodore is involved in a fight at school, and a client brings a gun into a law office and threatens his estranged wife.

You Look Different in Real Life,Gripping novel of kids filmed every five years for docu.,"In YOU LOOK DIFFERENT IN REAL LIFE, Justine is a typical 16-year-old high-schooler in all but one way: She and four classmates are the stars of a documentary film series that chronicled their lives at age 6 and then at 11. Now that the five kids are 16, the husband-and-wife directors Leslie and Lance are back in the Upstate New York college town to film them one more time: smart-aleck Justine; swim team star Nate; history-obsessed Rory; budding musician Felix; and glamorous Keira. At first Justine, worried she'll look uninteresting, wants to refuse to participate, but a mysterious email from one of her friends convinces her that they're all in it together. After the directors fail to capture much that's movie worthy, their producers insist the teens attend a team-building retreat together. Things take a dramatic turn when Keira runs away to look for her long-lost mother in Manhattan and the other four follow, with Justine behind the camera for the first time.
","Jennifer Castle doesn't shy away from hard topics, but You Look Different in Real Life is considerably lighter than her debut book, in which a teen girl loses her entire family in a car accident. Using the device of a documentary series (like the famous British 7 Up) to highlight how a group of kids have interacted since kindergarten, Castle is able to explore the dynamics of friendship and school life at ages 6, 11, and 16. Although the action takes place when the five documentary subjects are 16, there are plenty of flashbacks to the other two ages that shed light on why the kids are perceived a particular way. Felix, for example, the only full minority (he's Dominican), feels marginalized and ready for what he believes is his well-earned close-up in the newest documentary. While Nate, the son of the town's leading farming family, has completely changed his reputation from round-face bunny-loving bully victim to gorgeous swim star.
The three girls also have fascinating transformations and backstories. The novel's protagonist, Justine, had the most screen time in the second film, Five at 11, but she no longer feels she has much to contribute. She's worried about interacting with Rory, her former best friend, whom she dropped soon after his autism diagnosis, and she's suspicious of the relationship between Nate (whom she can't help but find attractive) and the beautiful Keira, whose mother abandoned her during the shoot five years earlier. In an age where so many teens engage in reality television and social media, You Look Different in Real Life captures the way leading a semi-public life (even just every five years) has deeply affected these teens who aren't always sure if they're acting for the cameras or being themselves. When everyone thinks they know you, how do you know yourself? In the end, each of the five kids has his or her moment in the spotlight (whether through tragedy, triumph, or both) and ends up the better for it.","Parents need to know that You Look Different in Real Life is a contemporary YA novel about a group of five 16-year-old classmates who've starred in a documentary series chronicling their lives every five years since they were kindergarteners. As the five teens face being followed by a film crew for the third time, they must each come to terms with the changes they've gone through from 11 to 16. There's occasional cursing, but nothing stronger than some uses of ""s--t,"" ""assh--e,"" and ""bitch."" The romance is limited to flirting and a couple of kisses, and the underage drinking/smoking is also scarce -- one undergrad party where there's drinking, and one scene where a teenager smokes a cigarette. The author explores tough issues like sexual orientation, divorce, bullying, parental abandonment, and autism.

Love and Other Foreign Words,Gifted teen girl discovers meaning of love in cute novel.,"Fifteen-year-old Josie Sheridan lives quite the charmed life: She's the baby of a close-knit family; a super genius who's both a junior in high school and a first year in college; and a tall, athletic blonde. She's so smart she has to ""translate"" the world around her into a language she can understand -- a daily chore that can be exhausting except around her family and lifelong best friends, neighbors Stu and his sister Sophie. Josie's world gets infinitely more complicated when her adored older sister Kate gets engaged to Geoff, an insufferable intellectual Josie can't stand. At first Josie vows to break up her sister's engagement, but as the wedding date approaches, she starts to realize that love (in all its forms) is the hardest language to understand.
","The book jacket blurb for this young adult novel references two of the genre's best authors, which naturally leads to high expectations that are unfortunately unmet and undeserved. Josie might be a ""gifted"" protagonist like Hazel Grace and Cath, but the comparisons are limited to their intelligence and the way they take a while to realize how they feel about their love interests. Josie isn't a likable main character; she can be alternately too mature and ridiculously juvenile. For example, Josie's antagonism toward Kate's fiance Geoff (and jealousy at their impending wedding) would be believable if she were 10-12 but seems selfish and off-putting at age 15-16.
The strengths of the story are the way the Sheridan family is depicted and how deeply the idea of love vs. like is explored. Clearly a surprise late-in-life third child, Josie is refreshingly close to her family, preferring to spend time with her parents and older sisters than to party with school friends. The romance in the book is on the light and cute side -- but also surprisingly thoughtful. Josie and her best friend Stu are not the type of teens to say ""I love you"" to their boyfriend and girlfriend unless they honestly, truly mean it (even if someone says it to them first).  Although some readers will want to shake Josie into self awareness, there is enough humor and depth (about intelligence, crushes, sisters, and love) to make this a sweet read for younger teens and fans of clean romance.","Parents need to know that Love and Other Foreign Words by Erin McCahan is a coming-of-age story for younger teen readers. It focuses on an extremely gifted 15-year-old junior who has to translate teenspeak and other foreign (to her) concepts into a language she can understand. There's rare offensive language (""s--t,"" ""a--hole,"" and one ""f--k"" that isn't spelled out; plus the insult ""retarded""), a few kisses, and adults drink wine at dinner or special events, so this is a story that even mature tween (11-12) readers of YA will understand. Readers who like books about quirky smart girls, close families, and best friends who turn to more will especially appreciate this book.

How Are You? / ¿Comó estás?,"Simple, attractive bilingual book about making new friends.","HOW ARE YOU? / ¿COMÓ ESTÁS? is the story of a friendly pair of giraffes -- one Spanish-speaking, the other English-speaking -- who befriend an ostrich. They engage their new friend with an initial ""Welcome! Bienvenida!"" and move on to questions such as ""Como estas? How are you?"" And at first it seems the ostrich doesn't have a reply. ""Are you shy? ¿Eres timida?"" they wonder and the ostrich replies with a simple ""No."" The curious giraffes go on to seek a more detailed response from their new friend and how she's feeling -- ""Are you hungry?... Are you tired?... Are you scared?...

Popular: Vintage Wisdom for a Modern Geek,Middle schooler tries '50s popularity guide in fun memoir.,"Maya is a self-described ""Social Outcast"" at her middle school in Brownsville, Texas. When she comes across a guide to popularity written in the 1950s, she decides to follow the advice written by a young model -- including wearing pearls, a girdle, and even planning a social event -- to see what will happen to her social world. Along the way, she answers her initial question -- ""Can popularity advice from half a century ago still be relevant?""-- in a sweet and heartfelt way.
","POPULAR: VINTAGE WISDOM FOR A MODERN GEEK has a fun premise, and sweet, smart, sensitive Maya is a girl lots of tween and teen readers can relate to. Her crazy antics -- like wearing a girdle to school! -- will leave readers laughing. But they'll also be touched by some of the personal details she shares: She feels overwhelmed on the her dead sister's birthday, and also when a beloved teacher dies; her school is on the border with Mexico and students face lockdowns and searches from drug-sniffing dog; kids and adults often say hurtful things to her -- and she also catches herself saying inane things to them!.
Readers get a clear look at Maya's home nd school life, and understand that while both can be hard, she sees what's special about them, too. It's these great details and Maya's authentic voice that make her realization that ""most people are waiting to be discovered too"" both believable and poignant. Some may find the original 1950s dvice about watching your figure a bit old-fashioned and even offensive, but lessons about holding yourself with confidence and -- especially --  reaching out to other people, will make a bigger impression on readers, as they do on Maya. ","Parents need to know that Popular: Vintage Wisdom for a Modern Geek is a memoir written by a middle school girl who, as an experiment, uses a 1950s guide to popularity to see if it can help her rise above the rank of “Social Outcast.” (That guidebook, Betty Cornell’s Teen-Age Popularity Guide, has been reprinted by Dutton and released in conjunction with Popular.) There's some talk of crushes and some dating. Maya's teacher uses some pretty frank words about body parts and STDs when it comes time for sex education. Maya also reveals what her mother has taught her about tampons. A boy on the autism spectrum tells Maya she's beautiful every time she sees him; a teacher tells her to let her know if it ever makes her feel uncomfortable. Another boy tickles Maya even after she tells him not to, and a teacher encourages her to report him. Pregnant girls get in a fistfight at school. There's a photo of smoke from a gun battle across the border in Mexico. Her school goes into lockdown when an armed robber's loose in the neighborhood. Drug-sniffing dogs come into her classroom.

Although some readers may wish Mr. Grumps got some comeuppance for his curmudgeonly ways, Waber's own gentle nature keeps him from vengeful themes: In the end goodwill and courage win out, and our crocodilian hero is restored to his family and is once again loved by everyone. However, given Mr. Grumps's determined hostility, Waber is forced to resort to that old chestnut of plot construction -- the timely lifesaving act that turns enemies into friends. Parents may wish Lyle could solve his problem in a way more accessible to real children, but by then the story is verging on melodrama, so the dramatic resolution is perhaps inevitable.","Parents need to know that kids love the simple felt-tip cartoon illustrations.

Their final settlement: the Bill of Life, which ends abortion but allows parents to choose to have their children ""unwound"" between ages 13 and 18. ""Unwinding"" is the transplanting of every part of the teens' bodies; since every bit of their bodies is still ""alive,"" they haven't technically been killed, right? WhenConnor discovers that his parents have signed an order for his unwinding, he tries to escape. Eventually meeting up with Risa, another escaping Unwind, and Lev, whose life has been tithed to the church, Connor tries to keep them all one step ahead of the police. But Lev may have other ideas.
","Once readers have managed the huge suspension of disbelief that UNWIND's premise requires, they'll find the story exciting and thought-provoking.

Fox chalks it up to his wild imagination ... until he and Dana find aliens inside their tent! The aliens run away as Dana and Fox flee into the house, baffling the adults relaxing in the glow of a TV screen.
","Grown-up fans of the sci-fi classic The X-Files will get a kick out of sharing this decent picture book with young future fans, but unfortunately it isn't nearly as clever or engaging as the TV show. The X-Files: Earth Children Are Weird bears only a superficial connection to its namesake, though it's a fine enough scare-debunking story for very young kids (who won't be ready for Scully and Mulder's grown-up adventures for many years).
Kim Smith's charming illustrations capture the coziness -- and spookiness! -- of backyard camping.

There are many instances of bullying and cyberbullying, including one character killing himself because he can no longer handle how a bully is treating him at school. Readers also will enjoy thinking about the question of vigilantism that the girls discuss in their film class: ""It was weirdly satisfying to watch each person get what he or she deserved. Could you even call it murder?"" Readers who liked the Pretty Little Liars book series and TV show re likely to get hooked on this series, too -- even before the planned TV show comes out.","Parents need to know that The Perfectionists by Sara Shepard is a guilty pleasure similar to her Pretty Little Liars series, and s such has some risqué content: In addition to drinking, smoking, drugs, two murders, some strong language, and label dropping, a lecherous teacher preys on female students, even collecting sexts from them; a girl makes her best friend think the boy she likes likes her back; a bully pushes a kid to suicide; a boy shares a sexy picture of a girl with his friends, and more.

All the Way to Havana,Celebration of Cuban family and ingenuity has gorgeous art.,"In ALL THE WAY TO HAVANA, a Cuban boy and his family travel from their rural Cuban village in their ramshackle mid-20th-century car to celebrate the ""zero-year"" birthday of a new baby cousin in Havana. But first they have to repair the ""tired"" engine that has ""all the rattling parts that have been fixed with wire, tape, and mixed-up scraps of dented metal."" The boy and dad tinker with the engine until they get it running, then take off on the road trip. After the family fiesta, they return home on dark roads under a bright moon, and the boy expresses his affection for their car.
","Folks on both sides of the political aisle who admire the vibrancy of the Cuban people will relish this warm family story about a road trip to Havana to celebrate the birth of a new baby cousin. All the Way to Havana paints a picture of a rural Cuban family and their inventive ingenuity in keeping their pre-Cuban Revolution 1954 Chevy running. Author Margarita Engle plays with sounds in the rural village where baby chicks chirp ""pío pío,"" and the rickety car engine sputters ""cara cara."" Embedded in her story are lessons about a society that's not endlessly disposable nd that enjoys life's simple pleasures.
Illustrator Mike Curato traveled to Cuba to research the art, and it shows. The family, retro cars, and street scenes are lovingly rendered using a combination of pencil drawing, painting, and textures added from photos. He is as skilled at depicting the stately old buildings of the capital as he is the warm brown faces of the Cuban people, making this a beautiful, nearly keepsake portrait of the colorful island nation.","Parents need to know that All the Way to Havana by Cuban-American poet and Newbery Honoree Margarita Engle (The Surrender Tree: Poems of Cuba's Struggle for Freedom), and illustrated by Mike Curato (Little Elliot, Big City), is a loving account of a family road trip in Cuba. When a rural family wants to visit their Havana cousins to celebrate the birth of a new baby, they first have to repair the engine on their rattletrap 1954 Chevy. Though there's no mention of the 1959 revolution or resultant U.S. embargo, it's clear that the island doesn't have access to shiny new cars or other consumer goods, and we see the people cleverly and creatively fix what they have. The family and neighbors are warm and friendly, and the very detailed art paints a vivid picture of Cuba, its people, and its roads filled with ""noisy old cars of every color.""

Confessions of a Triple Shot Betty,"Sweet core, despite drugs and sex references.","Sixteen-year-old Geena plans to spend her summer working at the Triple Shot Betty coffee shack, skateboarding, and hanging out with her best friend Amber and her favorite cousin Hero. The girl bonding doesn't go so well, though, so Geena has plenty to fill her diary: friends who hate one another; a flaky, divorced dad; and Ben, her long-time but very cute academic nemesis and potential crush.
","The book's Sonoma Valley estate setting and casual references to blow jobs and thizzing might lead some to think this is Gossip Girl, California-style. Wrapped in a sometimes raunchy exterior, though, is a sweet core, grounded by its authentic first-person narrator. Even its resident bad-girl, Amber, turns out to have an innocent secret.
Geena is smart, funny, and not afraid to flip off boys who hassle her while she is skateboarding. She avoids ""indulging in normal teen activities, like drinking beer, smoking bud, and having sloppy sex in parking lots."" She explores the line between feeling sexy on her own terms and feeling exploited by boys. A kiss is still romantic. While the handsome villain -- and his comeuppance -- are a bit over the top, teens will enjoy the grrl power ending.","Parents need to know that drinking, casual sex, and drug use are presented as common teen behaviors; in two cases, parents give teens glasses of wine. Girls deal with boys calling them demeaning names and treating them as sex objects. The 16-year-old main character is a straight-A student with a good attitude. The author weaves brand names throughout the story, from soda drinks to cars to types of wine.

And Then Things Fall Apart,"Smart, self-aware teen is obsessed with sex, Sylvia Plath.","In the summer before her sophomore year, 15-year-old Keek is quarantined at her Gram’s house with a bad case of chicken pox and a dog-eared copy of Sylvia Plath’s The Bell Jar. Her mother is in California tending to her sister’s premature newborn; her father is living in Gram’s basement after getting caught in an affair with a young woman at the family’s restaurant who had been Keek’s good friend. Not only is Keek an emotional wreck over her parents’ looming divorce, but she’s also struggling to decide whether to lose her virginity and have sex with her longtime boyfriend. Keek spends her convalescence with Plath and an old typewriter, hashing out her thoughts on her family, her boyfriend, her friends, and herself.
","The limited confines of the book -- feverish Keek, alone with her thoughts -- make for a slow start, and it’s a relief when she starts to have fun with her Gram and reconnects with her friends. Young readers will feel instantly at home with her: She writes with a dry, self-aware voice. Her obsession with her boyfriend, her frustration, her moodiness, and her vulgarity are on target for a teen in her circumstances.
Her identification with Sylvia Plath's heroine, Esther Greenwood, gives her a way to tackle the drama in her life, while her independent spirit assures she finds her own answers. In her isolation and frenzied self-expression, Keek can focus on being authentic and is able to accept the consequences for that, both good and bad. Parents might be taken aback by how obsessed Keek is with her virginity, but many teen girls will find a kindred spirit -- much like Keek finds with Esther.","Parents need to know that sexual issues are front and center in this smartly written book. Keek is obsessed with the physical aspect of her relationship with Matt and struggling to decide if she's ready to have sex. She's also very angry with her father, who was caught having sex with a young woman Keek was friends with. There's lots of salty language. It's mature stuff, but handled with maturity and wit.

The Princess in Black and the Mysterious Playdate,Princesses team up to fight sneaky monster in funny romp.,"In THE PRINCESS IN BLACK AND THE MYSTERIOUS PLAYDATE, the Princess in Black leaves the Goat Avenger in charge of keeping monsters from eating goats in the pasture, while she sneaks away to have a secret playdate with Princess Sneezewort as her pink-wearing self, Princess Magnolia. But she doesn't realize a sneaky monster who can hide by changing shapes has followed her. During their date, the sneaky monster goes after pets in the park (almost as tasty as goats), and each princess sneaks off to stop him -- Magnolia as the Princess in Black and Sneezewort as the Princess in Blankets (who grabs from a closet to create her monster-fighting costume). In the end, they team up, catch the monster, send him back down the hole to Monster Land, and do a victory dance with the Goat Avenger.
","This wild and silly adventure has the added fun of a new partner in crime-fighting, as Princess Sneezewort creates her own monster-bashing identity, inspired by the Princess in Black. Somehow the two girls don't recognize their friend underneath the superhero costume, but teamwork rules and they get their monster in the end. Lots of cute and funny moments along the way, and a clever monster who can shape-shift into a bush, a rock, a treasure chest, and a bench.

"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Hitchhiker's Guide Series, Book 1",The acme of British science-fiction humor.,"Just before the Earth is demolished to make room for a new hyperspace bypass, very ordinary Earthman Arthur Dent is taken offworld by his friend, Ford Prefect. Ford, it turns out, comes ""from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse,"" and is ""a roving researcher for that wholly remarkable book, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."" They hitch a ride on one of the Vogon constructor ships that demolished the earth, are ejected into space, and picked up by The Heart of Gold, a new spaceship powered by the Infinite Improbability Drive, which has just been stolen by two-headed, three-armed Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of the Galaxy. They journey with him to Magrathea, the planet where, millions of years earlier, the Earth was constructed as part of a giant, organic computer designed to come up with the question to the answer to the question of life, the universe, and everything. Get it?
","Originally written for adults, this witty, entertaining book has become very popular with bright middle schoolers and high schoolers who enjoy the snarky British humor. Some passages will go right over the heads of many readers, but for those who get it this pioneering classic introduction to the genre of British sci-fi humor can become an obsession, leading to Terry Pratchett, Monty Python, and others. The cliffhanger ending will drive them crazy, of course, but fortunately the whole series is available, so they can quickly satisfy their need to continue.
Despite the drinking and innuendo, many parents like to see their kids enjoying this because the humor is intellectual and verbal, rather than the usual American pratfalls and potty jokes. Many lines have become catch phrases to the initiated, a quick way to find those of like mind and interests: saying ""42!"", ""Life, don't talk to me about life,"" or Don't panic!"" to a roomful of young adolescents is one way to sort them out quickly.","Parents need to know that despite the dry, rather snide, humor, the author raises many issues, including materialism, the nature of existence, the role of bureaucracy, and lots more.

"Graduation Day: The Testing, Book 3",Final book in talky trilogy picks up pace toward the climax.,"GRADUATION DAY picks up where the previous installment, Independent Study, left off, with the United Commonwealth on the brink of civil war and Cia Vale determined to end The Testing once and for all. Cia seems to have the support of President Callindar, but the allegiances of her fellow classmates are less clear. She trusts her boyfriend, Tomas, but nearly everyone else has to be regarded with suspicion. When President Callindar gives her a list of people she must assassinate, Cia is unsure whether she can fulfill the mission.
","After what felt like an unneeded middle volume, Graduation Day regains some of the momentum the series had lost. Cia still doesn't know whom to trust, and her endless ruminations about the loyalties of her fellow candidates grow wearisome, but the pace picks up as the narrative approaches its climax.
Author Joelle Charbonneau choreographs some effective action scenes, and there are a couple of neat reversals before the central conflict is resolved. This series doesn't reach the heights achieved by some other dystopian science-fiction adventures, but it has its moments.","Parents need to know that Joelle Charbonneau's Graduation Day is a dystopian science-fiction adventure in the mold of The Hunger Games. It resolves the story begun in The Testing  nd continued in Independent Study, in which high-achieving students are pitted against one another in an exam that has life-or-death consequences. The violence is less intense in this installment than in the first, but there are shootouts nd explosions that have tragic consequences. The language is tame, with only a few instances of ""pissed"" and ""damn.""

My Mixed-up Berry Blue Summer,Girl stands up for gay mom in slight but thoughtful story.,"June has always known that her mom was gay, and she's fine with that. What she's not fine with is her mom's new girlfriend moving into their house on the lake and changing their lifelong routines. Furthermore, when her mom plans to marry her girlfriend in a public wedding ceremony, many of the townspeople openly discuss their disapproval in front of June, putting June in the awkward position of both wanting to stick up for her mom and agreeing that no changes should be made. June takes comfort in perfecting her pie-baking skills and working to win the local fair's pie competition, but when the townspeople start targeting her mom's store, June can no longer ignore the prejudice and must decide where she stands.
","MY MIXED-UP BERRY BLUE SUMMER is more interesting for its subject matter than its riveting plot or deeply developed characters. June's initial resistance to her mother's marriage -- not because of anti-gay feelings but because of a fear of change in the household -- saves this story from being merely didactic and adds some real depth to June's dilemma.
Other elements, such as June's pie-making expertise and her fear of jumping in the water, seem contrived to provide an easy and almost too-tidy means to both highlight and solve her problems. That said, June's emotional growth is believable, and the resolution is satisfying.","Parents need to know that My Mixed-up Berry Blue Summer main theme is prejudice against same-sex marriage and gay people in general. When June's mother decides to marry her girlfriend under Vermont's civil union law, June is uncomfortable with the negative attention she receives because of her mother's decision. June is bullied by some older boys, and her family is targeted by local townspeople, who boycott her mother's store, place offensive signs on their lawn, and gossip openly about how they disapprove of the relationship between June's mother and future stepmother. The content includes some anti-gay slurs, and some townspeople accuse gays of being pedophiles and spreading AIDS.

Finally, they settle down for storytime and sink into the adventures they find in classic children's books.
","The rhyming verse keeps the story moving and makes it all the more fun, and wonderful personalities of various bats and their antics really come through in the illustrations.
Bats tugging on lamp chains to light up the room, others hanging all around the lamp shade, still others dancing under the projector lamp, making shadow pictures on the wall ... this is just a bit of the fun.

When the boys start to investigate, it turns out the project is a boondoggle, secretly benefitting a few but with disastrous consequences for the surrounding community which includes the Quinn family farm, an elementary school, and a soccer complex. As he starts to investigate the highway project, Theodore has run-ins with some shady characters.

Ultimately, this is an adventure-packed story of kids fighting for what they believe.
","Like Nancy Drew, Theodore is somewhat two-dimensional, missing the real depth of a teenager. The plot-driven books in the Theorodre Boone series focus on the story more than the characters. That said, The Activist and all the books should engage anyone interested in the legal system and investigations.

The Higher Power of Lucky,"Newbery winner is delicate, humorous, poignant.","Lucky's life doesn't much match her name. Her mother was killed a couple of years ago when she accidentally touched a downed power line. Her father, who never wanted children, called his previous wife to come from France to take care of Lucky, and then promptly disappeared. So Lucky and her guardian, Brigitte, live in their trailer-home in the tiny, impoverished desert community of Hard Pan, subsisting on government surplus food and the occasional support check her father sends.
Lucky likes to eavesdrop on 12-step meetings, and wonders how she can find her Higher Power. But perhaps she has to hit bottom first, which may happen sooner than she thinks -- it appears that Brigitte may be longing to go back to France, leaving Lucky to enter the state system.
","This kind of book is catnip to Newbery committees. The lack of plot, the eccentric characters in a small community, the combination of humor and pathos, the sad but plucky protagonist in dire straits, the unhurried and media-free lives the characters lead -- it's all here. And author Susan Patron does a lovely job of it. The secondary characters are fascinating, and Lucky herself is intriguing: She always carries a survival kit, her hero is Charles Darwin, she plans to be a scientist, and she collects bugs in the breath mint containers thrown out by 12-step groups. Even the desert setting becomes a character.
All of it is delicately captured in black-and-white illustrations by Matt Phelan that perfectly match the tone of the text. Those who need plot-driven action probably will find this dull. But kids who loved Because of Winn-Dixie by Kate DiCamillo will probably love this one too.","Parents need to know that the main character's mother was electrocuted by a downed power line, and her father has abandoned her.

Those Girls,"Not much to like about these shallow, mean girls.","When mysterious -- and snotty -- Stella Fox transfers into Jinx's exclusive English boarding school, most of the girls immediately dislike her. But when she starts to steal Jinx's best friend, Jinx commits to discovering her secret. Making matters worse, evil housemistress Ms. Gunn is out to get Jinx and her friends -- torturing them with liquor raids and early-morning roll call (shouted over a megaphone). Even fun-loving Jinx has to wonder: Will life in the sixth form ever be good again?
","Readers may get a kick out of some of the over-the-top characters at Jinx's exclusive boarding school. There's Ms. Gunn, the faculty's angry drunk, who invents terrible punishments for the girls but always ends up as the butt of their jokes. There are also some tender moments between Jinx and her best friend Liberty, and nice images of Jinx's weekend home life with her wacky -- but loving -- family.
But in the end, readers will be troubled by the book's stereotypical characters, such as Liberty's overprotective Saudi Arabian father, who kidnapped her from her mother as a child and now makes references to ""common prostitutes"" when he catches her doing something he doesn't like. Also, the girls seem too wrapped up in their shallow lives and small dramas to care about anything real (when a teacher is injured in class, for example, the girls laugh and stand around instead of getting her help). This is yet another clique lit book series, so there will be plenty more to learn about those girls at Stagmount. But most teen readers -- even those that like a guilty-pleasure series -- should opt for something else.","Parents need to know that the characters in this book swear like crazy, sneak off of school grounds, wear designer clothes, drink, smoke marijuana, and take Ecstasy -- and generally don't seem to care too much about anyone. The book opens with Jinx hearing her neighbor having sex, and there is some other sex talk, but the most graphic encounter is a rendezvous between two of the women on the faculty. The book features lots of stereotypes, including offensive representations of Asians, Muslims, and lesbians.

"The Wide-Awake Princess, Book 1",Offbeat princess tale values girls with skills over looks.,"Princess Annie wasn't blessed with the magical gifts of her sister, Gwen, or princes and princesses in other kingdoms, so she looks quite ordinary and isn't affected by magic. This proves to be both a blessing and a curse when Gwennie turns 16 and pricks her finger on a cursed spinning wheel, sending the entire castle except Annie into a deep sleep. With the whole kingdom at risk, Annie is on her own to figure out how to break the curse, find a prince to take Gwennie's hand in marriage, and save everyone.
","THE WIDE-AWAKE PRINCESS offers an admirable alternative to typical princess fare. The protagonist is a kind, intelligent young woman who wasn't blessed with good looks but rather had to develop a personality and skill set all her own to gain favor. Though she keeps being reminded that she's lacking in the beauty department, she has no trouble finding the admiration and love of another person who values her for herself -- and she has a lot of fun typically reserved for princes along the way.
All this is told through the clever interweaving and subversion of old fairy tales such as Hansel and Gretel, Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel, and others, making this a uniquely progressive story that shows that action, romance, and adventure belong to all girls, not only the pretty ones, and that self-esteem comes from more than how the world reacts to your face. Bonus points for urging readers to question what it means to be capable and heroic, no matter your gender.","Parents need to know that The Wide-Awake Princess is an alternative to typical princess fare: It promotes autonomy, resourcefulness, and good personhood over being pretty or beautiful.

So Not the Drama,Race-aware teen series start overflows with plots.,"Mina starts high school with one goal: popularity. But when she enrolls in a sociology class, the teacher pushes her to think about her prejudices. She is paired with three very different girls -- a label lover, a quiet girl, and a loud girl from the projects -- and their interactions raise questions about race, class, and popularity. Her pre-existing friendships with a white drama girl, a jock, and a possibly-gay boy also cause Mina (and her clique) to think, debate, and come to more mature resolutions.

One character deals drugs, another remains snotty until the end, and another threatens several fights. There is some tension between two male characters after one begins to design costumes for the theater department, putting his sexuality in question.

Criss Cross,Lyrical tale of small-town teens in a '60s summer.,"This book is about one '60s-era summer in the lives of an assortment of very nice small-town teens. Just like a real small-town summer for teens, not very much happens. Life is pleasingly slow and languid. They listen to the radio, wonder about the opposite sex and about themselves, hang out, talk, grow a little, change a bit, come to a few understandings they didn't have before.
One boy is inspired by a college coffeehouse to take some guitar lessons in the basement of the church. A girl befriends and helps out an elderly woman. Paths cross, connections are made, or missed. It's real life, lyrically rendered.
","CRISS CROSS is an intriguing book, absolutely deserving of major awards. It has no plot, only slightly defined characters who are hard to tell apart or keep track of, no hero or protagonist or clear point of view, no action or suspense or mystery, just a touch of gentle humor. And yet ... it is a deeply lovely book, profoundly observant and wise about the little things in life that most books, children's or adult, ignore, or perhaps don't even notice. So what keeps the pages turning? Is it the gorgeous writing, the penetrating insights, the little bits of philosophy and keen observation?
It's something of a little miracle, really -- the author spends three whole pages describing a boy looking at himself in the mirror, and it's almost impossible to put down. Either this kind of thing grabs you, or it doesn't -- and for most kids age 10 and up, it won't. A few, those with a thoughtful or poetic or mystical bent, will find it enthralling.","Parents need to know that Criss Cross is a Newbery-wining novel by Lynne Rae Perkins bout small-town teens whose paths cross one summer in the 1960s. There's one instance of swearing, and a teen character uses chewing tobacco, which his friends find revolting.

Dactyl Hill Squad,Civil War-era kids ride dinos in New York in curious mashup.,"In DACTYL HILL SQUAD, Magdalys and her friends from New York's Colored Orphan Asylum head to a Shakespeare play one evening on the orphanage's old triceratops. On the way, the corrupt city magistrate astride a knuckleskull threatens the group and urges them to turn around. Magdayls prays their triceratops will rear up and startle him -- and he does just that. And later when the theater begins to burn and her friend needs rescuing, the fire department's brachy understands her. And understands when Magdalys, the theater actors, and all her friends need to get somewhere safe. Rioting has broken out in New York City and African Americans are being targeted. The group heads to a safe house in Brooklyn, where they're given a place to stay and a job: to use dactyls to gather intel around the city and alert the safe house when African Americans are threatened in New York City. After the riots, many more have been kidnaped and sent South as slaves. Because of Magdalys' newfound talent to communicate with dinos, she's the best person for the job.
","It's a shame that a book with so fascinating a premise -- African American kids astride dinos in Civil War-era NYC -- is so poorly set up and executed. The many glossaries in the back of the book may hold more interest for readers, mostly because the writing is clear, the way it should be for middle graders. It seems like the story begins three chapters in. We know just a little about Magdalys and almost nothing about the kids that will be the Dactyl Hill Squad. And when the big rescue scene jumps hastily to ""we're chimney sweep spies now"" there will be more head-scratching. So much doesn't get developed. It allows for more action -- there's a whole lot of that -- but it's grounded in very little and, again, hard to follow, like a sketch instead of play-by-play.
Kids may still take a lot away from Dactyl Hill Squad, though. They'll get a new perspective on the Civil War era, a few dinosaur facts, and a great heroine who learns to embrace her talents and take pride in them like all kids should. Here's hoping the writing in the sequel gets a much finer polish.","Parents need to know that this is the first book for tweens by the author of the popular young adult Shadowshaper series. Like the that series, this story is set in New York City and features African American and Latino characters. But here, the story is set during the Civil War era and throws in domesticated dinosaurs for a fantasy twist. The main character, African Cuban Magdalys, sees a theater and her orphanage burn during rioting, finds her adult friend lynched and burned, and hears that many other African Americans were killed or rounded up and sent back to slavery in the South. In a climactic gun-dinosaur fight, dinosaurs eat people and other dinos -- the only gore described is a dino's throat torn out and a dino's head half shot off. A fight at sea with guns and swords leaves slavers dead and loved ones kidnaped. Other mature content is mild: Adults drink beer and say ""damn."" Kids should check out the extensive glossary in the back to learn more about events, people, places, dinosaurs, and even old-fashioned guns mentioned.

You Know Me Well,Sweet story of gay teens who become fast friends.,"Told in two points of view, YOU KNOW ME WELL is the story of Bay Area teens Mark and Kate, who've sat next to each other in calculus for an entire year but don't know each other until one fateful night when they both happen to be partying in San Francisco the week leading up to the annual Pride parade. Mark and Kate are both gay and in romantic dilemmas. He's out but in love with his best friend/secret friend-with-benefits Ryan, who seems to crave a hookup with someone else even though Mark is quite obviously in love with him. Meanwhile, Kate ditches a long-awaited meet-up with the object of her affection, Violet, the worldly and beautiful bisexual cousin of Kate's best friend. Kate spots Mark at a gay bar where he's competing in an underwear modeling dance-off, and the two connect nearly instantaneously. After an evening of adventure and heartbreak, Kate and Mark help each other navigate the last week of school, romantic possibilities and realizations, and even major decisions about the future.
","LaCour and Levithan's compelling if occasionally implausible story focuses on the beautiful relationship between two gay teens who are in the right place on a night they each need a friend. Both authors are gay, and it's the first time Levithan has partnered with a writer for a book where both protagonists are gay. Kate and Mark's instant connection might seem unlikely to some readers, but it makes perfect sense given their individual journeys that they would discover a kindred spirit in the other. Both are desperate for love but unsure if they've found a true version of it: Mark can't see beyond his complicated secretly physical relationship with BFF Ryan, and Kate worries the ""real"" Violet won't live up to her idealized vision of her.
Since visual artist Kate and baseball player Mark's adventures are set against the backdrop of San Francisco Pride, the book is particularly appropriate for readers looking for strong LGBTQ themes and characters. But the story is universal, too -- the main characters might already know they're gay, but there's still plenty up in the air. They're still dealing with romantic insecurities, confusion over their futures, and issues with their other friends (most of whom are also gay, since particularly in Kate's case, coming out in eighth grade meant becoming a beacon to the other queer kids). Two secondary characters seem a bit too perfect (Violet is nearly unbelievably sophisticated, and Ryan's new suitor is ridiculously perfect, with his trifecta of looks, smarts, and humanitarianism), but otherwise this is a touching and relevant tale about friendship and love.","Parents need to know that You Know Me Well is a dual-point-of-view realistic novel written by acclaimed LGBTQ authors Nina LaCour and David Levithan about a gay junior and a lesbian senior who become fast friends the last week of school. Although the emphasis is on the protagonists' platonic friendship, they each have romantic relationships causing them trouble. There's a smattering of strong language (including ""f--k"" and ""s--t"") nd several references to passionate kisses, friends who fool around and have had sex but remain ""just friends,"" hooking up with new people, and loss of virginity, but none of it is graphic or crude. The books contains positive messages about LGBTQ youth and how support and friendship are necessary for teens to feel safe coming out. There are also messages about gap years, college, travel, and open communication between friends and between older kids and their parents.

Toby Alone,"Offbeat eco-message tale weighs some complex, dark themes.","Toby lives an idyllic miniature life in a tree (though he doesn't know it's a tree), and he has never been anywhere other than his home branch. All is great until Toby's scientist father makes a discovery that threatens their society's foundational beliefs and the way they live. He argues that the tree is alive, and unless they change thier habits, the tree will die. Neither the governing Council, the citizens, nor the developers like this news, and as a result, Toby and his parents are exiled to the ""lower branches"" -- a most undesirable place to live. Toby becomes a fugitive when he escapes and tries to free his parents. Along the way Toby runs from friends-turned-foe, finds giant holes in the tree used as work pits, meets strange people from other parts of the tree, discovers the slave-like camps owned by the evil developer Joe Mitch, and learns how to barely survive a world full of fear, hatred, and cruelty.
","Toby Alone is a wild, unending ride. The world of the Tree is well-imagined and described, complete with lakes, bark caves, lichen forests, as well as nefarious political and industrial characters. The illustrations are a nice addition, and the map inside the cover is enjoyable to scour. There are memorable pieces of wisdom, such as, ""Fear is what makes you fall,"" ""Beauty sometimes sneaks into the hardest of hearts,"" and ""When you mourn somebody, you also mourn what they didn't give you.""  
While the plot is fairly simple -- Toby's journey to find and set free his parents -- the twists and turns, myraid characters and motivations, and multiple flashbacks make for a complex and intricate tale. There are more mean and undesirable characters than there are inspirational ones, and this has the bizarre effect of making his world feel one-dimensional, especially since the bad guys are fairly stereotypical. Readers may feel ready for his journey to end long before it does. Hearty readers may enjoy the highly detailed saga but still wonder how the story could end so abruptly. ","Parents need to know that while this adventure story looks appealing for younger kids (including map and illustrations), its messages are dark and unapologetic. Issues such as betrayal, cruelty, torture, greed, distrust, societal prejudices, and truth-hiding are clear, though not resolved in this installment. The main character, Toby, is running and fighting for his life throughout the entire book, which feels exhausting, and he meets a multitude of dismal characters.

Absolutely Almost,"Sweet, funny, poignant tale of struggling 10-year-old.","Ten-year-old Albin (""Albie"") Schaffhauser isn't very good in school or at much of anything compared with his parents (his Swiss-American dad and Korean-American mom are busy overachievers) or his friends (one of whom becomes a reality show star). He makes the guy who delivers the Chinese takeout to his family's eighth-floor Manhattan apartment very happy because he can't calculate and always overtips. His fancy private school has booted him for not being able to keep up academically, so now he's starting public school, where he meets caring teachers, makes a friend, and encounters mean kids. However hard he tries, he's never better than ABSOLUTELY ALMOST good at anything. Helping him get through it all are some kind teachers and the free-spirited art student his parents hire as his nanny.
","Many a kid has failed to measure up to expectations, and Albie's struggles to figure things out and deal with being called ""dummy"" will resonate with a lot of young readers. Some will feel good figuring out some things before Albie does, from math to social cues. Albie's day-to-day life in Manhattan will fascinate kids who live elsewhere, from visiting the bodegas and the Bronx Zoo to riding the subways -- and experiencing what happens when the subways break down. The adventures (and coping skills) of his best friend Erlan's family when they become reality TV stars will have young and old readers in stitches.
Characters reflect New York City's diverse culture in a light, matter-of-fact way: Albie's mom is Korean-American, and his dad is Swiss-American; Erlan's family comes from Kazakhstan; and one of Albie's classmates has two dads. ","Parents need to know that Absolutely Almost follows in popular author Lisa Graff's tradition of interconnected plot threads and light, upbeat stories resting atop deeper issues. In this case, 10-year-old Albie struggles with living up to his parents' expectations, coping with mean kids at school, dealing with change, and figuring out what he's more than almost good at. Along the way he has quite a few adventures -- usually with his babysitter, Calista -- that broaden his horizons, teach him new skills, and get him into trouble -- such as the time he doesn't want to face the mean kids at school, so he and Calista go to the zoo instead. Many kids will relate to his difficulties, appreciate his triumphs, and laugh at the gentle humor. (If they've missed the Captain Underpants series, Albie's enthusiasm for it may steer them in that direction.)

George's Secret Key to the Universe,Stephen Hawking tale confuses fact and fiction.,"George, whose parents shun all technology (even light bulbs!) is thrilled to find that his new neighbors, Eric and his daughter, Annie, have the world's most advanced computer. Known as Cosmos, it can open doorways to space and other planets. But George's sinister teacher seems to have an unusual interest in finding out more.
Interspersed with the story are nonfiction sections with information about -- and photographs of -- planets, stars, and other celestial objects, including the author's latest theories about black holes.
","Stephen Hawking may be a genius at physics, but he has a lot to learn about children's books. GEORGE'S SECRET KEY TO THE UNIVERSE is an example of what you get when someone decides to write for children because, after all, how hard can it be? It also exemplifies the dangers of trying to combine teaching with storytelling: What you often end up with is a preachy, didactic story told in a condescending tone with stereotypical characters and a plot that doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
The nonfiction parts are fine: good information, clearly told, with some spectacular photos. But surprisingly, much of the fictional story isn't scientifically accurate. This might be forgivable in straight sci-fi or fantasy (though even there kids like to have things make sense), but in a book that purports to teach the basics of astronomy and physics, it's just confusing -- how are young readers to know what's true, what's theoretical, and what's just plain nonsense?","Parents need to know that there's nothing objectionable here, and much to learn.

Last Stop on Market Street,Tender story of Nana showing grandson city beauty via bus.,"As CJ and his grandmother hop on the city bus and head across town, he begins to ask questions: Why don't we have a car? Why do we have to stand out here in the rain? Why can't that man see? Why is it dirtier on this side of town? Nana, in all her wisdom, gently answers his questions, helps awaken his imagination, nd shows him that beauty is all around him, nestled in the routine things of city life. All he has to do is look, and listen. Their bus ""breathes fire,"" the driver does magic tricks, the man may be blind but he ""sees"" with his ears and nose, and so on. The characters on the bus are an assortment of ges, sexes, and ethnicities: one with whole-body tattoos, one holding a jar of butterflies, a guitarist, a dog, and others. Without being didactic, this story teaches the reader, along with the boy, the value of getting out into the world and connecting with it, appreciating rather than fearing diverse types of people, and trying to look at it all through eyes and ears that are opened wide. Also, perhaps, we learn that we do not need things to make us happy. ","LAST STOP ON MARKET STREET is a crosstown bus trip we all should take. Author Matt de la Pena's words carry the story smoothly and poetically along, with just enough varied examples to engender thoughtful engagement.  Exceptional rtwork by award-winning illustrator Christian Robinson fills out the story and dds energy and a whole other dimension to the social importance of the book. Together, words and artwork convey the book's important lessons much like Nana teaches CJ: quietly, and tenderly. By the time the grandmother and her grandson arrive at the soup kitchen, the boy realizes how glad he is that they came. Readers will feel much the same way once they've read this book. ","Parents need to know that Matt de la Pena's tender picture book Last Stop on Market Street, which won the 2016 Newbery Medal as well as a 2016 Caldecott Honor and Coretta Scott King (Illustrator) Book Award for illustrator Christian Robinson, is aimed at younger readers but holds valuable, uplifting life lessons for all ages. Without being heavy-handed or didactic, it teaches the value, and fun, of cceptance, generosity, appreciation, and imagination in a less than perfect world. Nana, a strong, graceful African-American grandmother, believes in finding beauty in the world around her. And she lives by what she believes. By answering her grandson's questions, she gently imparts her wisdom to him on a crosstown bus trip that takes them from church to the soup kitchen where they help out each Sunday after church. The language is simple and poetic, the warm-hued artwork vibrantly energetic, and the tone lovingly accepting. This is a quiet book with an amazingly powerful message about learning to live comfortably amid the diversity of ordinary life.

Butterfly Yellow,Moving post-Vietnam War story of courage and perseverance.,"In BUTTERFLY YELLOW, Hằng's younger brother, Linh, was taken to America at age 5, in the final days of the Vietnam War, as part of Operation Babylift. Six years later, Hằng, 18, has finally made it to America after enduring an arduous journey filled with many heartbreaking moments, and she's on a mission to find her now 11-year-old brother. Along the way, she meets an aspiring cowboy named LeeRoy, who reluctantly takes her to the small Texas town where Linh has been living. Hằng is thrilled to reunite with her brother, but she wasn't prepared for Linh --who now goes by David -- to have no recollection of their family. Can Hằng find a way to reconnect with her brother and help him remember details about their life in Vietnam?
","Thanhha La's moving and lyrical historical novel -- her first for young adult readers -- powerfully explores family, friendship, hope, and survival. Hằng and LeeRoy might seem like an unlikely pair, but they're both outsiders in West Texas and form a sweet bond that's filled with many comical moments. Some readers might find it challenging to decipher Hằng's English, but LeeRoy is quick to understand her Vietnamese pronunciations and becomes the connecting bridge between Hằng and Linh/David. As Butterfly Yellow progresses, teens will be inspired by Hằng's fierce love, strength, and determination and see that this is a story of courage, communication, and perseverance.","Parents need to know that Butterfly Yellow, by Newbery Honor author Thanhha Lai' (Inside Out and Back Again, Listen, Slowly) is a moving historical novel about 18-year-old Hằng, who's searching for her little brother in America six years after the end of the Vietnam War.

This decision sets him on the road to a true political career with unexpected results.
","Like all the books in the Farmer Brown series, this one is pretty funny even if some of the jokes will go over kids' heads. That's all right because they'll enjoy the story even as the grown-ups are smirking as they read it aloud.
As it turns out, Duck will remind readers of other politicians they might know (right down to heading to the late-night talk shows for better exposure). The illustrations are a good match for the funny, quick-moving text, making this a strong addition to the Farmer Brown series, and a timely one at that.

Wait,"A gem of a book about noticing small, everyday wonders.","WAIT contrasts a preschool boy's interest in all he passes with a mom's need to hurry to their destination. The mom pulls the boy along as he stops to look and wonder at everything they walk by: a dog, a cement mixer, ducks. ""Hurry,"" says the mom. ""Wait,"" says the boy. The mom is not unloving; she's just busy, glancing at her watch and cell phone, racing the rain and the train schedule while the boy stops to marvel at colorful fish and a butterfly. But when a double rainbow appears by their train, they both stop to enjoy it. ""Yes, wait,"" agrees the mom.
","In this perfect gem of a book celebrating the world's small wonders, a preschool boy stops to marvel at all he passes while his mom hurries him along to catch their train. Told mostly with two words, ""Hurry"" and ""Wait,"" we see the world through the boy's curious eyes, as the mom rushes past dogs, ducks, butterflies, and raindrops, until they're finally both stopped by the beauty of a double rainbow. ""Yes, wait,"" agrees the mom. There's as much to notice in the art as there is in the young boy's walk, and visual themes are threaded through; the promise of the rainbow is hinted at when the boy points to a rainbow ice pop.
This is a book for parents and kids to share and treasure, a reminder to stop and enjoy not only the world but the young children in our care. The author's dedication reads: ""For my mom, who waited.""","Parents need to know that Antoinette Portis' Wait is a lovely reminder to stop and smell the roses -- or pet the dog, or wave to the cement mixer, or catch a raindrop on your tongue.

"The Beauty of Darkness: The Remnant Chronicles, Book 3",Strong characters make this overlong finale satisfying.,"THE BEAUTY OF DARKNESS begins with the near death of Lia, who sustained two arrow wounds escaping from Venda with Prince Rafe and four of his soldiers. While the main bridge out of Venda has been destroyed, they still don't have much time to escape to one of Prince Rafe's Dalbreck outposts. And once she's healed enough to ride, Kaden and Griz, Lia's former Vendan kidnappers, find them. Lia and Rafe don't know if they can trust them as deserters and not traitors, so Kaden and Griz join the march to the outpost with hands tied. They prove their worth, however, in a skirmish against more Vendan assailants, and Kaden and Rafe enter into an uneasy truce. It's a truce that's tested upon their arrival at the outpost where Rafe is immediately greeted as king instead of prince, his father dead from illness. Rafe sets his mind to getting everyone safely to Dalbreck's castle, especially Lia, whom he wishes to marry and protect from any more harm. But Lia is too concerned about her country, Morrighan, and talk of treachery there, so she insists she must go with Kaden, despite the price on her head. She senses her bigger purpose to unite countries in the fight against the massive Vendan army and won't let even her love for Rafe stand in the way.
","Yes, it's a very long finale -- with the real battle action not happening until after page 600 (sigh) -- but the growth of the strong characters makes it worth the slog. And author Mary E. Pearson makes you care about all the kingdoms preparing for war and what it will cost them. Readers learned sympathy for the oppressed Vendans in Book 2 and now Morrighan in The Beauty of Darkness, despite how Princess Lia's parents treated her. Pearson carefully weaves in the different perspectives through a number of minor characters' backstories. We finally hear Kaden's story in more detail, making his father a worthy nemesis.
While there's spying and treachery aplenty in Morrighan and Dalbreck to keep the story moving -- mostly -- a few glimpses of life in Venda preparing for the war would add some much-needed climactic tension. Readers are told over and over that the enemy is coming, but that's not the same as showing it -- for example, showing the Komizar rounding up mere kids to fight and preparing his arsenal. We're shown a lot of romantic tension, however, and fans drawn more to the romantic story will do plenty of nail-biting as Lia and Rafe's relationship woes unfold.","Parents need to know that Mary E. Pearson's The Beauty of Darkness is the last book in the fantasy-romance Remnant Chronicles series aimed at mature teen readers. Kingdoms have been on the verge of war for two books now, and 600-plus pages into The Beauty of Darkness it finally rages and things get especially ugly: Child soldiers are used by the enemy (many are rescued), and there are some graphic descriptions including a man being ""halved"" and explosions ending in ""meadow, horse, and blood, raining down, the pieces still on fire."" Things get bloody even before that with multiple skirmishes with swords, knives, bolts, and arrows. Some of the good guys die, but most suffer bad injuries. Two arrows are cut from flesh, a man is slowly poisoned, an abdomen is stabbed with blood gushing, bolts are shot through a hand, punches are thrown, a frying pan causes a concussion, and a sexual assault is halted with a bolt through the neck before clothes are removed. Other mature content includes some drinking of ale and wine and sex twice between the main love interests; nothing is described with any detail, and there's a mention of protection being used. Readers will continue to see main character Lia's amazing transformation from political pawn in Book 1 to prisoner in Book 2 to being a commanding presence out to save the world here -- quite a transformation. She has already learned to trust her instincts and works very hard to be heard, knowing many lives depend upon it. ",,15,14,Mary E.

Ellie is incredibly relatable: She's nervous, a little uncertain, and trying to figure out how to balance being a good friend, a good competitor, and a good mystery-solving engineer.

Young readers will enjoy Ellie and Kit's strong friendship, and the way they encourage other contestants to be silly and fun while trying their best.

Lost in a fiery desert, the Bones get separated. Fone makes his way to a lush forest, where he is threatened by stupid rat creatures, welcomed by a human girl named Thorn, and rescued by a laid-back Red Dragon. The Bones are eventually reunited, but many tantalizing mysteries remain at the end of this first volume.
","Very few comic series announce themselves as classics from their very first issue, but this is surely one of them. In Out from Boneville, creator Jeff Smith has a masterly drawing style that harks back to Walt Disney's animation glory days. Smith fills the plot with adventure, danger, word play, and complicated slapstick, hitting each mark with grace. Each character has hidden depths, even the blustery Phoney Bone. Although aimed at middle school readers, the book will appeal to a variety of ages, and it's good that all nine volumes are available for rapid consumption.","Parents need to know that Out from Boneville is the first installment of a nine-part graphic novel series by Jeff Smith. It recounts the adventures of three Bone cousins -- Fone Bone, Phoney Bone, and Smiley Bone -- after they flee their village in the wake of one of Phoney's colossal scams. Smith's masterly drawing style will remind some readers of classic Disney animation, captivating in its details and expressive in its big moments. Violence is limited to threats from the rat creatures, some blasts of fire from the Red Dragon, and the burning of Gra'Ma Ben's home.

Another Faust,Great online marketing for not-so-great prep school tale.,"In this modern ""re-telling"" of Faust and his bargain with the devil, four 10-year-old children are already so deeply scarred by their parents that they are willing to run away with the devil, who is in the guise of a cruel governess. One of them even gives the devil her twin sister in exchange for physical beauty. After honing their new gifts for five years, the devil introduces them into a private and very posh prep school in Manhattan. The teens quickly claw their way to the top of the social rankings: Bella as the Queen Bee/It Girl; Victoria as the scholar; Christian as the athlete; and Valentin as the poet. Their ambitions and cruelty are matched by the very rich students around them, who are getting wind of their secret. After a few months some of the ""Faust"" children recognize their mistake and try to make a run for it, but how do hide from the devil?
","The brother-and-sister team who authored the book are in their twenties and are using social networking tools such as Twitter and Facebook to market it; unfortunately, the writing is not very good. The characters are not very likable or well developed. The bargains the ""Faust"" children made and the gifts they received in return are revealed too slowly.
Although the Faust teens begin to pay dearly for their deals (as if giving up their soul wasn't enough), we don't get to know them well enough to care. They are beautiful, humorless, and soulless, so their ruthlessness is not very surprising, or as sad as it should be. For example, Bella has chosen to give up everything in return for physical beauty, but has to pay with breath so bad that no one will come near her. She is rotting from the inside out, a pretty shell only (the story hits the reader over the head in case they miss the point). This story really should be a satire about the superficial values of our society that drives teens to obsess over perfection, but there's no humor in it. You can't have effective satire without humor.","Parents need to know that the authors have used social media (twitter DinaNV or DanielNayeri), created play lists for their characters, and created an ANOTHER FAUST Facebook page, so there may a lot of buzz about this book among teen readers. The setting among the very rich, private school world so popular in the Gossip Girl series may attract fans, but as is fitting a modern telling of Faust and the devil, this story is dark, and the characters are not sympathetic at all. The idea that four children could have so much hate and envy that they would sell their souls at the age of 10 distorts the original story and dilutes its power, so any educational value of  ""introducing"" teen readers to a classic is pretty much lost. The kids are mean, and sad;  the parents are mean, and of course, the devil is completely heartless.

Sisters First,"Sweet, spunky celebration of sister love.","As SISTERS FIRST begins, the main character and narrator has no siblings, feels lonely, and wishes and prays for a sister: ""Please make us kind, with enormous hearts, / clever too, and very smart. / With soft hands to hold and rms to hug, / and gentle eyes that show deep love."" She gets her wish and the baby arrives. She's a little disappointed at first: ""You cried and you ate, but not much more. / (My new baby sister was a bit of a snore.)"" But she remembers her prayer nd realizes: ""If kindness was what I was asking of you, / I needed to be kind and patient, too."" In time, they become playmates and rely on each other for comfort and imaginative free play. Two other pairs of sisters are shown doing things together, too, both real (making pickles dipped in sprinkles) and in fantasy (flying hot air balloons, tap dancing in the clouds, being cat pirates on the sea and mermaids riding alligators).  ","With cute art and clever rhymes, this loving look at sisterhood is both spunky and sweet in describing what's meaningful about this special bond. ""Sisters are partners (mainly in crime), / We play tricks on our parents / and sneak treats at bedtime."" And having two other sister pairs in the mix adds fun and diversity.
Sisters First is lively, imaginative, nd full of positive messages, including the final couplet of the main character's prayer: ""And through many days, the best and the worst, / help us remember we are sisters first.""","Parents need to know that Sisters First is a picture book by twins Jenna Bush Hager, known as a Today show co-host, nd Barbara Pierce Bush, co-founder of Global Heath Corps. They are the daughters of former U.S. president George W. Bush. This charmingly illustrated, rhyming picture book bears the same title as their bestselling 2017 memoir for adults, Sisters First, but that one has a subtitle: Stories from Our Wild and Wonderful Life. The main characters in this book aren't twins but rather an older and younger sister. It shows the older one's patience in watching her sister grow from baby to playmate and friend. Two other sister pairs appear, too. One pair has brown skin and hair, and in the other pair, the older sister is White nd the younger one is Black.

Princess Hyacinth: The Surprising Tale of a Girl Who Floated,"Warm-hearted, beautifully illustrated flight of fancy.","What child doesn’t dream of soaring among the clouds? For Princess Hyacinth, alas, being lighter than air is a curse, not a blessing. She would float away forever if she weren’t weighed down by her royal trappings. The lonely princess is resigned to watching kids play outside from the safety of her stony castle. One day, she impulsively tries a plan to float along with a bouquet of balloons -- but finds herself going up, up, up ... Luckily, a new friend comes to her rescue.
","Hyacinth is a sensible, fearless heroine, a good alternative to the saccharine, sparkly trifles all too often presented to kids. This is, at its core, a gentle coming-of-age story: Hyacinth knows her loving parents mean well, but she needs to test her wings. Through her friendship with Boy, at long last she’s able to soar.
Heide’s prose is engaging, but it is Lane Smith’s rich brush-and-ink artwork that makes this whimsical fairy tale a treasure. Princess Hyacinth glumly trudges about with her crown squashed down on her head. When she finally floats free, she nearly catapults off the page with freewheeling joy. Pre-readers can enjoy the book on their own just by savoring the lovely pictures.
Elegant, whimsical, and absolutely delightful.","Parents need to know that the heroine in this whimsical fantasy doesn’t want to be weighed down by her unusual problem. Kids might be alarmed when the princess begins to float aloft, but her concerned parents keep watch over her and Hyacinth feels joy and awe, not fear. The princess strips down to her underpants for her high-flying adventures. An affectionate friendship between the princess and Boy blossoms as the pair find a way for the princess to safely play.

"The Kingdom on the Waves: Octavian Nothing, Vol. 2","Brilliant, brutal sequel set during Revolutionary War.","This sequel to the National Book Award-winning The Pox Party finds Octavian escaping with Dr. Trefusis, with the two making their way into beseiged Boston in 1775. After a stay there filled with privation, illness, and some fleeting moments of happiness, they head south to Virginia to join Gov. Dunmore, who has promised freedom to any slaves who join his army to fight against the rebels. But Dunmore is incompetent -- and only interested in freedom if it helps him win.
","That this is a brilliant historical novel there can be no doubt. Complex narrative structure and sophisticated, often lyrical, language are employed to bring to life an almost forgotten part of the American Revolution from an equally forgotten point of view -- that of the slaves, whom both sides attempted to use, and neither side considered human.
Through nearly 600 pages of misery, illness, violence, and witty philosophical discourse, Octavian's hope for the betterment of humanity remains, in spite of his almost uniformly horrific experiences. This is a dense book, and the literary style will make it a challenge for many teens. Keep a dictionary at their elbows.  ","Parents need to know that this award-winning book is told from the perspective of an escaped slave who fights in the Revolutionary War to gain his freedom. The intense subject matter means that there's plenty of grim, graphic violence -- including hanging, decapitation, rape, and torture. A major character is killed, with his jaw and part of his skull blown off. There are also sexual references, racist attitudes, and swearing.  But through this mature material -- which is written in a dense but lyrical style that will be challenging to teens -- readers will get an incredible story that not only tells of a teen coming of age but also offers a unique perspective on the American Revolution.

 ","Ken Nordine's descriptive text deserves to be read out loud while listeners pore over Henrik Drescher's fascinating collages. In fact, one might read these poems and hear Nordine's own familiar NPR broadcast voice.
Adult children's-book collectors will love this book, but many children just won't get it. This book was read to children of various ages and sophistication levels, and although they all were immediately drawn in through the pictures, some of the concepts and subtle references went over their heads.

Wicked Lovely,Modern fairy tale fascinates; some iffy content.,"All her life, Aislinn has been able to see faeries, and they are everywhere, invisible to mortals except for her. And these are not your average cute Disney pixies -- they are the same size as humans, and can be very nasty, especially to those mortals who can see them. To survive, Aislinn has had to learn to pretend not to see them, and to live behind steel walls, which keep them out. All Aislinn wants is to explore her growing relationship with Seth, finish high school, go to college, and lead a relatively normal life. But now she's being stalked by the faeries, especially one, Keenan, who is the Summer King and wants her for his Queen. Keenan is able to endure steel, and will have Aislinn whether she agrees or not -- if she doesn't, the power of his mother, the Winter Queen, will be unchecked, and winter will descend on the earth forever.
","Marr hits all the right notes -- strong characters, a bit of suspense, a tinge of horror and fantasy, and romance that's not laid on too thick -- all placed in a resolutely modern setting. Unlike so many novice authors, Marr is careful and nicely restrained. She doesn't feel she has to let loose with every idea she has ever had in some sort of pyrotechnical display that leaves the reader's head spinning. She keeps her story focused, which helps build the suspense and keeps the attention on the characters.
All of them, major and minor, are interestingly complex (except possibly Seth, who's a little too much like every teen girl's fantasy), and operating with mixed motives. There's even a nice bit for Niall, one of Keenan's advisers, who stays in the background for most of the book but steps forward near the end to talk Keenan back into his better self. The book is an assured piece of work from a newcomer to watch.","Parents need to know that, while there's nothing graphic, there is discussion of sex, virginity, first times, STDs, and other sexual content. There's also a bit of swearing, alcohol, and drugs. Strong, fluid, and respectful characters are an asset to this novel. Readers will root for the smart Aislinn -- and Seth, too -- as they tackle difficult decisions. This book has inspired sequels and an upcoming movie.

Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great,Realistic story about friendship and facing fears.,"Judy Blume's OTHERWISE KNOWN AS SHEILA THE GREAT is the second book in the author's \""Fudge\"" series, most of which focuses on Peter Hatcher and his brother, Farley Drexel \""Fudge\"" Hatcher. Sheila Tubman, the protagonist in this book, lives in the same building as the Hatchers and is one of Peter's classmates. This novel tells about the summer after fourth grade, when Sheila's family rents a house in Tarrytown, N.Y. Sheila is an extremely fearful child -- afraid of dogs, thunder, water, etc. -- but when she begins to make new friends in Tarrytown, many of the fears she tries to mask are exposed and she is forced to face them head on, and hope that her new friends will still like her.
","Sheila is a quite believable and lovable character despite -- or maybe because of -- her shortcomings. As in so many of her novels, Judy Blume creates realistic situations that are highly entertaining and teach kids important lessons without ever seeming false or preachy. Kids will identify with Sheila's reluctance to admit how scared she is, or admit that she doesn't know how to do some things other kids can do. Judy Blume has said that she endowed Sheila Tubman with all of her own childhood fears, and maybe that's why this book is so touching and so true.","Parents need to know that Judy Blume's Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great is the second book in the ""Fudge"" series. However, this volume focuses on Sheila Tubman, a neighbor of the children at the center of the other Fudge books, Peter and Farley Drexel ""Fudge"" Hatcher. Sheila is a classmate of Peter's; this novel is set during the summer after fourth grade, when Sheila's family rents a house in Tarrytown, N.Y. Sheila is an extremely fearful child, and much of the novel focuses on experiences where she tries to mask, or has to face, the fears that create big obstacles in her young life. Other than a few kid scrapes and pranks, there are no violent or dangerous situations in the book outside of Sheila's imagination. This is good teaching material for parents of fearful children who are ashamed to admit or face their fears.

English Roses: Too Good to Be True,Second story joins Madonna's girl clique.,"The five English Roses, now including Binah after Madonna's first English Roses book, are great friends who still do everything together -- that is until new student Dominic de la Guardia joins their 5th grade classroom and jealousy among the girls rears its ugly head.
As Dominic begins to show more of an interest in Binah than in the other girls, the other girls begin snubbing Binah and leaving her out of their usual activities. The problem comes to a head as the class prepares to hold a school dance. However, the ingenuity of their teacher Miss Fluffernutter and the help of the fairy godmother pull things back together.
","All in all, this story is cleverly told and entertaining. Again Madonna employs the classical storytelling technique whereby the narrator interjects comments now and then that playfully chastise the reader. She has also developed several silly characters: the playful, eccentric teacher Mrs. Fluffernutter, the pumpernickel-eating fairy godmother, and the dancing Ferguson boys with their tongue-twisting names Timmy, Terry, Taffy, and Tricky.
In this story, the quintet learns a few lessons about jealousy, this time it's over liking the same boy. While the lessons learned are quite pertinent and discussion-worthy for tween girls, the illustrations don't carry the same positive messages. The characters promote a skinny-model girl image that is already too prevalent in today's media world, and the story seems to condone the idea of the snooty girl clique.","Parents need to know that the broad message is positive, though subtle suggestions aren't. The characters are skinny, ""Twiggy-type"" girls, and even the boy characters look like models. The girls agree that ""looks are not everything,"" but it's hard to believe they mean it. This looks like a picture book, but it's bigger and longer and not a story for young children.

Ella Sarah has a clear idea of how she wants to look and she is determined to have her own way. Later, her young friends arrive for a tea party and all are attired just as zanily as Ella Sarah.

The Day My Mom Came to Kindergarten,Kindergarten jitters flipped in cute story of mom at school.,"A little girl invites her mom to spend a day with her in kindergarten and then must repeatedly reprimand her as Mom stumbles though the class activities and routines. ""Don't worry,"" the girl tells her. ""Everyone makes mistakes at first. You'll be fine if you just watch me and do what I do."" Mom has to learn how to mind her manners, wait her turn, pay attention, clean up, raise her hand rather than shout out answers, use her indoor voice in the library, ask permission before going to the bathroom, return to class without dawdling, control her anger, etc. In the end she gets it down, but decides to to stick to something she's already good at: being a mom.
","It’s a fresh take on the kindergarten jitters: Instead of a kid having to learn the classroom rules from a teacher, here a well-behaved kindergartner shows her clueless mom how it's done. Kids will enjoy the power shift as the story subtly touches on the common fears, emotions, and mishaps kids may experience on a first day of school -- and the relief that comes with knowing what the pros know. Mike Lowery's cartoon-like illustrations add the right amount of humor to keep situations familiar and the laughs coming.","Parents need to know that The Day My Mom Came to Kindergarten turns the tables on the usual first-day-of-school scenario, where the parent or teacher assures the kid it'll be OK and the kid learns the classroom routines.

Miles is quickly enlisted in their war against the Weekday Warriors, the rich kids who go home every weekend, and they bond over elaborate pranks, studying, and assorted rule-breaking. About halfway through the book a tragedy occurs, and those left spend the rest of the book trying to make sense of it, to solve the mystery it leaves behind, and to pull off one last, greatest-ever prank.
","This coming-of-age novel is gorgeously written, passionate, hilarious, moving, thought-provoking, character-driven, and literary. It deserves all the awards it's won. The characters may often behave badly, but they are vividly real, complex, and beautifully drawn -- and their stories can help readers start dealing with some big topics, like self-discovery and loss.

Are We There Yet?,Car trip turns to time travel in highly imaginative story.,"In ARE WE THERE YET?, a boy and his parents are traveling to Grandma's for her birthday. It's a long drive, and ""after the first hour, it can feel like an eternity."" Readers have to turn the book around and upside down to read the next lines of text and are prompted by arrows to turn the next pages backward -- at which point, the car starts traveling back in time. It passes a horse and rider racing an old locomotive, gets stuck on the plank of a pirate ship, drives past a jousting match and into ancient Egypt, and pulls to a stop amid dinosaurs. With a reminder to ""take a second to savor the moment you're in,"" the reader turns the book again, and the car starts moving forward, overshoots Grandma's party into the future and finally arrives.
","A car trip to Grandma's that seems endless becomes a trip through time in this highly imaginative book that turns readers' expectations -- and the book itself -- upside down.

The Cabin Faced West,Story takes kids back to the frontier days.,"Imagine yourself passing peas and potatoes to General George Washington! That's exactly what happens to young Ann Hamilton and her pioneer family one fateful night in western Pennsylvania. This charming, historically accurate story transports readers back to a time when the frontier was being settled, and families never knew who--friend or foe--would show up for dinner!
","With its cheery tone and fast-paced blend of fact and fiction, THE CABIN FACED WEST is the quintessential Jean Fritz book. It has all the earmarks of the award-winning author's other historical fiction books: a light, sprightly style, a dash of humor, and a dose of history. The wild frontier of early pioneer life forms the backdrop for this story, though unfortunately no date is given to ground the story. Early on, Fritz illuminates the mind-set that permeated the new West: The back of Hamilton's cabin was ""turned squarely against the East just as her father had turned his back.""
The artwork is wistful, especially when Ann Hamilton is shown in relation to the adults around her. Fritz paints her ancestor as a sympathetic character who uses pluck and intelligence as she struggles to surmount both homesickness and sibling conflict.","Parents need to know that this is a lively tale about a pioneer girl's joys and hardships, and includes an encounter with George Washington.

Guardian,"Powerful book about lynching, rape; older teens only.","Ansel, growing up in a racist southern town in the 1940s, is friends with a black boy, has a crush on the preacher's daughter, and can't imagine doing anything with his life other than taking over his father's store. Then the preacher's daughter is raped and murdered by the son of a powerful white family, and his friend's father is accused. Ansel and his father both know the truth, but neither says anything when the man is lynched, a decision that blights the rest of their lives. Includes author's historical note, appendix, chart of lynchings by state, and brief bibliography.
 
","Author Julius Lester lays bare the reality of the dreadful act of lynching, and the culture that supported it. Of all of the terrible things now thankfully in our history instead of our present, though not so far back as we'd like to think, lynching is surely one of the worst -- the act itself, of course, but also the horrifically festive way it was often perpetrated. The story, and even more so in the stunning back matter, will shatter many of the comfortable myths that we use to separate ourselves from our own past.  
	The subject matter here is strong stuff, and Lester sets it out in stark and angry terms. At times this works against him, causing him to create cartoon villains like Zeph, the white boy who rapes and murders the virginal preacher's daughter and pins the blame on an innocent black man. But at other times he shows remarkable subtlety, especially with Ansel's conflicted feelings about his crush, his father, his future, and, eventually, his own part in the lynching.
  ","Parents need to know that this novel is for older teens only -- it has some very rough content, including lynching, rape, and murder. The intense subject matter -- lynching and its effect on everyone involved -- is powerfully disturbing. Teens ready for the material will be ready for some powerfuldiscussions (see the publisher's discussion guide for ideas) and will learn a lot about the history that inspired this book through the author's historical note, appendix, chart of lynchings bystate, and brief bibliography. There is also teen sex, some swearing, and drinking.

When Sal goes out with her mother to pick blueberries, a mix-up causes an unexpected adventure. Robert McCloskey's gentle, engaging story keeps preschoolers absorbed as Mrs. Bear meets Little Sal and Little Bear surprises Sal's mom. Today's audience, expecting color, might find the the black-and-white illustrations a little disappointing.
 ","This humorous, entertaining book for preschoolers is an easygoing tale with just enough suspense to make it interesting. Robert McCloskey's text and illustrations blend perfectly with the mix of characters to tell a story that tickles the imagination. The full-page illustrations make it easy for children to understand the emotions of the characters.
The idea of a little girl and a bear cub each following the wrong mother appeals to preschoolers' sense of humor. But beyond the entertainment value, the story provides some lessons for children. Subtly showing the kinship of humans and animals, McCloskey closely parallels the stories of Little Bear and Sal. This is an excellent read-aloud.","Parents need to know that there is just enough suspense and humor to hold a preschooler's attention. The art (though black and white) pulls children into the story and makes events easy to understand and discuss.

Time for Bed,Young listeners may drift off to lullaby.,"A drowsy lamb, a sleepy mouse, a stretching gosling, and a wobbly foal are getting ready for bed. Just like the baby animals (encouraged by their mothers with rocking repetition), young listeners may find their eyes fluttering as they hear this lullaby-like tale.
 ","The gentle rhythm and lush blue-and-green watercolors make TIME FOR BED a book parents and kids will choose over and over. It's nearly impossible to read the poem in anything but a hushed, slow voice. The repetition and rhythm encourage parent and child to slow down and take time over each page. The sheep touch noses, the mother cat washes her kitten, and the deer nuzzles its fawn.
Jane Dyer's watercolors cover each double-page spread. She has painted every parent with a loving gaze, even if that parent is a cow or fish or dog. And every baby's eyes are almost closing.","Parents need to know that this is a soothing bedtime pleaser with baby animals, warm watercolors, and rhyming text.

"Mr. Lemoncello's All-Star Breakout Game: Mr. Lemoncello's Library, Book 4",Loony library game is all about fiction -- and empathy.,"Kyle Keeley and his fellow seventh-graders (aka the Lemon Heads) have been waiting months for the premiere of  MR. LEMONCELLO'S ALL-STAR BREAKOUT GAME. Their zeal is rewarded when the next epic library adventure is announced, and the Lemon Heads' combined skills help them make the cut. They soon realize, though, that they're in a lot of trouble (and not just because Kyle has ditched detention for the contest). For one thing, rich kid Lemoncello hater Charles Chillington is back, bent on revenge for past slights and humiliations, and fielding a team of eighth grade bookworms-for-hire. Also back: former cheerleader-classmate/current TV star Haley Daley, with a team of preening, backbiting Kidzapalooza stars. This time it's all about fiction. And surprises. The prize is awesome. Let the games begin ...
","Chris Grabenstein returns with more loony library fun, brain-teasing puzzles, and a brand-new game that plunges the intrepid Lemon Heads into fictional worlds as they seek fun, fame, and prizes. The category is fiction, and this time Mr. Lemoncello's All-Star Breakout Game has his contestants on a fast-paced, plot-twisty solve-a-thon through the horror room, the comic book room, the fairytale room, and more.  Engaging and cheer-worthy as ever, Kyle, Sierra, Akimi, and Miguel bring teamwork and talents in the face of strong opponents and never-a-dull-moment developments (you never know when those paper-rock-scissors skills are going to come in really handy).","Parents need to know that Mr. Lemoncello's All-Star Breakout Game is the latest installment in Chris Grabenstein's best-selling library-themed series, with a steady bombardment of book and pop culture references, wild imagination, loony humor, and more. This time it's all about fiction -- and incidentally, the empathy you get from putting yourself in a character's place. Once again there's a bit of butt, fart, poop, etc., humor -- with Smell-o-Vision in the story (but fortunately not in the actual book). Once again regular kid Kyle Keeley and his fellow seventh-graders face long odds but are well served by interesting teamwork. The game involves scenes and characters from many kid-fiction classics, which is part of the fun for those who've read them already and a great source of recommendations for those who haven't.

The Way Things Work Now,Captivating look at the things that power our world.,"Macaulay divides the nonfiction THE WAY THINGS WORK NOW into five parts: ""Mechanics of Movement,"" ""Harnessing the Elements,"" ""Working with Waves,"" ""Electricity & Automation,"" and ""The Digital Domain,"" a section new to this edition. The Digital Domain looks at a wide variety of things we take for granted in the 21st century, including touchscreens, games controllers, bits and bytes, robots, and virtual reality. The epilogue has very brief illustrated histories of inventions from gears and turbines to rockets, mirrors, and electric lights. And for those not fluent in all things mechanical, there's  section devoted to defining technical terms found in the book.
","This wildly imaginative and entertaining exploration of how things work makes the complicated world of machines and technology accessible to every reader. And it's filled with visual puns and delightful illustrations. For kids who find all things scientific intimidating or even just plain boring, Macaulay's witty and user-friendly explanations -- a woolly mammoth having its tusks trimmed is used to illustrate a section on levers -- make tricky theories easily understood.
For visual learners, the heavily illustrated text should be of particular help in processing the large and wide-ranging amount of information. Granted, this information can be found online but certainly not in a way as fun and engaging to readers. ","Parents need to know that The Way Things Work Now is the revised and updated edition of David Macaulay's The Way Things Work (1988) and The New Ways Things Work (1998), which have sold more than 2 million copies worldwide. Like in the previous versions, this one's brimming with Macaulay's witty, detailed, and colorful illustrations and is certain to captivate young readers who are passionate about all things technical and mechanical -- even those who live in dread of another year of science class. Kindle users should know that it's vailable only for Kindle Fire. David Macaulay is both a Caldecott Medal (Black and White) and Honor (Cathedral and Castle) winner.

Alphabet Explosion! Search and Count from Alien to Zebra,Artistic alphabet search is clever but tricky.,"The book begins with instructions on how to play the game, what to count, and what not to count. After warning the reader that the game is tricky, pages present each letter of the alphabet with the challenge of finding a specific number of items starting with that letter. The answers are given at the back of the book.
","More an offbeat alphabet search game than a story, this book will test even the oldest readers. Young kids may be overwhelmed with the challenge of finding 22 A's or 45 S's. They may even find it impossible since not all the words are nouns, which can be hard for younger kids to understand. The mix of sounds -- hard and soft ""c"" sounds, for example -- may confuse beginning readers.
The brightly colored, playful illustrations in acrylics and spray paint on watercolor paper are inventive and inviting. The cartoon-like creatures will make kids want to play the game. But clever pictures may not make up for the obtuseness of some images; it's a little too ingenuous for its own good. Thank goodness a list of answers is presented at the back of the book.","Parents need to know that there's nothing objectionable in this book, but its alphabet searching game can be frustrating and too tricky at times, especially for its target audience of beginning readers.

"The Forever Man: W.A.R.P., Book 3",Action-packed finale lacks wow factor of first two books.,"When Riley hears his brother is alive and languishing in notorious Newgate Prison, he's ecstatic. He has his wormhole-vanquished evil boss Garrick's money and will pay any debt to get his brother released. His friend Chevie, a junior FBI agent from the future, is wary of Riley's long-lost brother suddenly turning up, but he ccompanies Riley to Newgate anyway. It turns out that Chevie is right -- it is a trap, but it's a worse one than she could have imagined. The assassin Garrick has emerged from the wormhole to exact his revenge and in the scuffle drags Riley and Chevie further back in time with him, back to a small English town in the 17th century where Garrick is already known simply as the Witchfinder -- and on this trip Garrick has brought the town's inhabitants two more witches to burn.
","The first two W.A.R.P. books had that riveting wow factor, making it a surprise that the finale is only pretty good. Maybe it's the 17th-century town setting in THE FOREVER MAN. It can't compete with Victorian or modern London, the settings of the other books. So much of author Eoin Colfer's witty wordplay came from the Victorian dialects and descriptions of the crazy characters that lived there. People on witch hunts are just not very fun. A couple of modern-day characters sneak into the story, but even with a talking dog in the mix, it's not enough.
Or maybe Book 3 isn't as amazing because of Garrick. He's a stunning villain character in Book 1, but in Book 3 he comes back with very few new tricks up his magician sleeves -- well, except the not-dying part. And readers may find themselves a little too caught up in the why and how of Garrick and other creatures emerging from the wormhole intact. The rules seem to keep changing just in time to suit the story. If Forever Man were more of a stand-alone time-travel tale, readers would walk away satisfied enough, but because we know what wonders Colfer is capable of, it's a bit of a disappointment.","Parents need to know that The Forever Man is the last book in the W.A.R.P. time-travel trilogy by Artemis Fowl uthor Eoin Colfer. The violence is a touch milder than that in Book 1, The Reluctant Assassin, and Book 2, The Hangman's Revolution, but the series as a whole is best for kids already well versed in PG-13 action movies. Deaths are from gunshots, a knife cutting a throat, molten metal melting off a face, a heart attack from fright, cannon recoil, matter manipulated and sucked up into the wormhole, and a cannon breaking two giant creatures apart so their various pieces float in the air before being sucked into the wormhole. The main characters are imprisoned in devices meant to kill them painfully, with talk of administering the ""Devil's Brew"": molten silver down the throat of a suspected witch. Drinking and a bit of smoking are all done by adults. One adult who spent years drunk and in trouble eventually swears off drinking. Chevie and Riley continue to be equally resilient and smart main characters, making this the rare sci-fi read that will appeal both to boy and girl readers.

Blackout,Beautiful book captures the magic after lights go out.,"It's a typical hot, noisy night in the city. A child wants to play a board game, but everyone else in the family is too busy. Then the lights go out -- all across the city. Nothing works. The family leaves their sweltering apartment and heads to the roof, where the stars shine bright and their neighbors are having a ""block party in the sky."" Down below, kids splash in water from an open hydrant, enjoy free ice cream, and make music. When the lights come back on, everyone goes back to what they were doing before … until the young child clicks off the light. And the family gathers round for a board game by candlelight.
","In an age of digital distractions, a power outage is a major disruption -- and, as John Rocco illustrates in this beautiful picture book, a rare opportunity. Instead of pining for the mythical good old days, when people didn't spend hours a day staring at screens, this book shares the pleasure of powering down and enjoying the moment.
 Rocco's work is familiar to older readers who are fans of Rick Riordan: Rocco has illustrated the Percy Jackson, Kane Chronicles, and Heroes of Olympus series. In Blackout, his gorgeous artwork features strong lines and saturated colors. Comic-style panels and minimal text let the pictures speak for themselves.","Parents need to know that Blackout celebrates family and community coming together without distraction or devices.

The Man in the Moon: The Guardians of Childhood,Adventures of young Man in the Moon a perfect bedtime read.,"The Man in the Moon wasn't always a man; he was once a little boy, called MiM, and this book tells his story through the sailing of great ships and the fighting of great battles, including one between Pitch, the King of Nightmares, and Nightlight, the brave guardian of MiM. Readers find out what MiM does with balloons after they float into Earth's sky and the origins of some of the most beloved children's fantasy characters, including Santa Claus, Mother Goose, the Sandman, and the Easter Bunny.
","THE MAN IN THE MOON is breathtaking. It has an old-fashioned feel, yet at the same time seems very modern and fresh. Author-illustrator William Joyce weaves a fantastic tale that gives the origins of the bright, friendly face children see in the night sky. There is fun, fantasy, a dramatic battle, and personal loss. Most of all there is hope. Readers will love the new twist on familiar faces from children's literature and lore, and the book may even pique an interest in astronomy.
Joyce's wonderful storytelling is amplified by his dazzling illustrations, which are sophisticated yet whimsical. Each page stands alone as a work of art and clearly conveys the emotion of the story. When the Nightmare King rolls across the page in all of his gloom, it ups the excitement, intrigue, and apprehension.","Parents need to know that there is a scary part in which MiM, the title character, loses three people very close to him. The villain is dark and mysterious, which may frighten young children. While the deaths are not shown, it may lead to some serious questions from little ones.

Shiver,Does for werewolves what Twilight did for vampires.,"For years, Grace has watched the wolves outside her Mercy Falls, Minnesota home every winter. She is particularly drawn to one with stunning yellow eyes. She is certain that it is the same wolf who saved her from its pack who attacked her when she was a young girl. When Grace meets the wounded and temporarily human Sam, she knows from his yellow eyes that he is her wolf. Immediately drawn to one another, they fall in love during their first encounter. Sam leads two lives. He is human in the spring and summer, but he turns into a wolf when the temperature turns cold. The problem Sam faces is that the longer he remains a wolf, the less time he spends in human form. A time will eventually come when he will not change back and will forever be a wolf. That time is coming soon...
","Elegantly written, Stiefvater's story offers a unique and interesting take on werewolf lore. Grace and Sam, the two protagonists, are mostly defined by their love for each other, but the author avoids brooding melodrama by injecting a fresh and playful sense of humor in their interactions. They have great chemistry. The characters are appealing, intelligent, and well-defined. Their willingness to use their intellects to deal with the challenges they face is refreshing.","Parents need to know that although this is a werewolf story, there's more romance than horror. It's a love story between a boy and a girl; the boy just happens to be a werewolf. The passion between the characters grows throughout the story, and they do have sex once in a tastefully written fade-to-black scene. Compared to other paranormal romances like the Twilight saga, this novel stands out in the genre. The writing is fresh and lyrical, and the characters well-developed and credible.

Written through notes, newspaper issues, and official letters, the novel moves along at a quick pace sure to draw in the most reluctant readers. Kids will dig Seymour Hope and the ghost, Olive C.

An Inconvenient Truth: The Crisis of Global Warming,"Green teens may want fewer facts, more activism ideas.","Al Gore offers evidence of global warming, calling it a ""climate crisis"" and detailing how it will affect the planet and its inhabitants.
","Kids may find the book a bit alarming and overwhelming -- and may need proactive parents to present the content with a hopeful tone. If you saw the documentary An Inconvenient Truth and were left feeling overwhelmed by what could be in store for our fragile planet and our fellow humans, now you can pass that feeling on to your kids; the content here is basically the same, generously illustrated with Gore's slides. What the publisher failed to grasp in the repurposing process was that kids need a different approach. You don't have to dumb the message down, but you don't have to spend all your time trying to convince them with graph after graph, either -- they're already much greener than the older generations.
Blink and you'll miss the brief mentions in Chapter 15 of alternative forms of power, fluorescent lightbulbs, green roofs, hybrid cars, and hydrogen fuel-cell buses. After that, a two-page spread (out of 190 total pages) encourages everyone to take action: Ride your bike, recycle, turn off lights, spread the word.","Parents need to know that this book on global warming contains almost exactly the same information as the documentary An Inconvenient Truth. A few images -- like those from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina -- are disturbing, but the really upsetting part for kids will be that they get 166 pages of dire scientific evidence followed by just one brief chapter (#15) of ways people can impact the earth for the better.

Step by Wicked Step: A Novel,Honest portrayal will appeal to kids.,"Five classmates find a journal kept by a boy who ran away from his stepfather, which prompts them to tell their own stories of stepfamilies. Rarely has any author so effectively gotten inside the heads of children from broken homes with such insight and clear-eyed understanding. 
","Anne Fine does so much right in the book, beginning with the spooky old mansion and the finding of the journal and its Dickensian melodrama. But it's the stories the modern children tell that resonate with readers, both those who have had similar experiences and those who haven't. The book is not about solving problems, but about simply dealing with them. All of the children get a chance to express themselves, and to realize (along with readers) that they are not alone.
The children are sometimes too sophisticated in their insight, becoming merely the mouthpiece for the message, but the way they think and feel is on target. Notably, and most important, the author recognizes and validates the anger many children feel when the adults who should be caring for them cause their lives to spin out of control, and then expect them to just adjust and be happy. It's not all happy endings here, but it does have the taste of reality.","Parents need to know that few books capture so perfectly the feelings and thoughts of children of broken homes.

Spinning,"Frank, sensitive coming-of-age tale of young lesbian skater.","SPINNING is a graphic novel memoir that spans the author's youth from age 11 through high school. At first Tillie lives in New Jersey, waking up early every morning to take ice skating lessons before school, but after fifth grade, her family moves to Austin, Texas, and her emotionally absent parents drop her abruptly at her new rink. She has to adjust to new skating friends, a new style of coaching, and new cliques at school. While fending off a bully, she becomes close to a girl named Rae, and they have an eighth grade romance, though they move on to different high schools. Tillie continues to practice and compete in ""mid-level competitive figure skating,"" and though her heart's not always in skating, she works hard to earn the rank she's aiming for. ","This poignant coming-of-age memoir set in the all-consuming world of ice skating competition rings with emotional honesty as it deals frankly with feelings of alienation and lesbian attraction. Graphic novelist Tillie Walden tinges Spinning with a sweet sadness. While the moms of the other skaters micromanage from a ""mom table,"" Tillie's mom is remote and cold, and her parents never come to practice, much less competitions. She's left to find her own way emotionally, a bit like a latchkey kid, if the key was to a skating rink. She craves connection -- with friends, with girls she has crushes on, and with her female coaches and teachers, whom she resourcefully turns to for simple affection. Though the setting's specific to ice skating, the rigor and discipline will be familiar to many tightly scheduled kids, and the emotional content feels intensely real and relatable. The plot hits many standard YA notes -- a family move, adjusting to new schools, cliques, girl bullying, sexual advances by a male adult in an authority position -- and her first love is both tender and fraught.
The deep purple and yolk-yellow palette is particularly effective at evoking the violet light of early, predawn practices. Walden has an observant eye for visual detail and a keen ear for conversation, and while the memoir has the fragmented feel of real life and doesn't always tie neat bows, it movingly chronicles the hopeful story of a girl lost and ultimately found.","Parents need to know that Spinning is a coming-of-age memoir by Tillie Walden, a talented young graphic novelist newly in her 20s, still close to the teen years she writes about. The book is set very specifically in the competitive ice skating world in which she was immersed, and the intensity of the coaching and competition will be familiar to others who are deeply involved in a sport or in ballet, musical instrument study, or another consuming extracurricular. Tillie is a lesbian who knew she was attracted to girls from age 5, and one particular crush results in an eighth grade romance with sexual exploration. She also fights off a male SAT tutor who tries to push himself on her sexually. There's rare use of profanity, including ""d--khead"" one time and several uses of ""f--k"" over four pages toward the end of the book. Spinning is especially helpful for teens who feel adrift or disaffected. There's hope and inspiration in the fact that Walden went on to excel at visual art and produce this thoughtfully observed book.

"The Mark of Athena: The Heroes of Olympus, Book 3",Seven demigods in one sweet ride are off to save Rome.,"Leo's amazing flying/sailing ship the Argo II arrives in New Rome (California) to greet Roman demigods in peace and friendship and reunite with Percy Jackson. Unfortunately, the peace and friendship part doesn't go so well. Leo gets possessed by some vengeful spirits and starts shooting fireballs everywhere, necessitating a pretty hasty exit with Percy and Romans Hazel and Frank. Now they have all seven demigods on board for the prophesied quest (plus the crazy satyr chaperone Coach Hedge), but they're also being chased by Romans across the country -- and they know where the Greek Camp Half-Blood is. There's no time for demigod infighting, though. The seven must follow the prophesy to Rome to save the world from certain destruction by garishly dressed twin giants. Luckyily for Camp Half-Blood, Annabeth has another quest as well -- searching for a symbol powerful enough to restore the rift between Greeks and Romans; a symbol only a child of Athena, like Annabeth, can find.
","These dventures add up to another great quest fantasy fans will want to embark on.
Holding a fast-paced fantasy-quest-adventure together with seven different heroes that deserve almost equal weight has the potential to really weigh the story down. And yes, sometimes the action stops and readers will want to get back to their old pal Percy again.
But, overall, every hero takes a turn at being awesome. Near the beginning Leo's ruse against Narcissus is pretty hilarious. At the climax, Annabeth's trick against her particular nemesis (not giving anything away) is quite brilliant.","Parents need to know that The Mark of Athena is the third in The Heroes of Olympus series that spun off from the uber-popular Percy Jackson series about teen demigods (one Greek or Roman god parent) on quests to save humanity from ancient monsters still at large in the world. Rick Riordan combines plenty of action and danger (usually not gory but sometimes scary) mixed with lots of humor and learning. As in Book 2, The Son of Neptune, there are more comparisons between the Roman and Greek aspects of the gods, but in this book readers will also get a mini-tour of Rome. There's a little more kissing in this installment -- Percy and Annabeth are back together (at last!), and they get in trouble with the ship's ""chaperone"" Coach Hedge when they fall asleep talking after hours.

Counting by 7s,Striking tale of quirky girl connecting after parental loss.,"Willow Chance is a 12-year-old adopted girl in Bakersfield, CA, a self-described ""person of color"" who's obsessed with gardening, rare skin conditions and other medical oddities, teaches herself Vietnamese, and counts by sevens to relax. Her white parents are the only people who really understand her -- her teachers never do, and her only friend moved away. At the start of middle school she scores 100 percent on a standardized test, prompting her teacher to send her to the school counselor, assuming she cheated. The counselor, a sloppy, burned-out slacker, snaps out of his doldrums when he figures out she's a genius, not a cheater. After Willow loses her parents in a car crash, the counselor takes an interest in her and two other misfit students of his -- a teen brother and sister -- and all of their lives become entwined with devastated Willow's.
","This amazing novel offers an indelible, appealing outsider protagonist and a cast of quirky, good-hearted characters who intersect against a backdrop of a 12-year-old's unimaginable loss. Chapters are variously narrated either by Willow or an omniscient narrator. The ones in Willow's voice are filled with offbeat ""field note"" observations and dry humor, as well as stunning metaphors that capture the numbing experience of grief, such as ""Life, I now realize, is just one big trek across a minefield and you never know which step is going to blow you up.""
But Willow doesn't become bitter, and the novel is more heartwarming and uplifting than sad. Her teen friends' immigrant single mother, who's struggled to provide for her kids, kindly steps up to help Willow, and the girl appreciates how she maintains her even disposition no matter what life throws at her: ""Maybe that's what happens when you've been through a lot,"" Willow reflects. ""All of your edges are worn off, like sea glass. Either that or you shatter.""","Parents need to know that Counting by 7s is an exceptional novel that deals with a death and grief. The 12-year-old protagonist, Willow Chance, is a genius outsider whose parents are killed in a car crash as the book begins, but the accident's not described in graphic detail. The only blood in the book appears when Willow faints and cuts her head on a table. Positive role models abound in this heartwarming story that shows how grief feels but is ultimately a celebration of the indomitable human spirit. And though it's marketed to kids as young as 10, it could appeal to teens, as well, as it tackles complex feelings and issues of fitting in and features two compelling teen characters.

With the help of Tris' brother, Caleb; Tobias' abusive father, Marcus; and the Dauntless friends they reunite with, Tris and Four discover that a key to stopping the Erudite from pursuing their goal of complete domination is to align themselves with the factionless, who aren't the starving and homeless they were thought to be but rather a highly organized and militarized group of outcasts led by someone with connections to Tobias. When Tris decides the only way to help the cause is to turn herself in to the Erudite, she doesn't realize that Tobias will stop at nothing to save her -- and their cause.
","Once again, Veronica Roth has created a pulse-quickening plot that delves further into the dysfunctional governing structure of factions that either collaborate or can't stand each other. In the tradition of second installments, Roth introduces in-depth exposition, new characters, seemingly unsurmountable challenges, and cliffhanger-level twists to move the story forward. The factionless folks are particularly fascinating, since as the literal outcasts of the book's highly stratified society, they're unpredictable and free thinking. It's also refreshing to have so many women as leaders, even though they have completely opposing agendas.
As in Divergent, INSURGENT centers on Tris, a beautifully flawed heroine much in the Katniss Everdeen (of The Hunger Games) mold of fierce and unflinchingly courageous young women. Unlike Katniss, however, Tris only has eyes for Tobias/Four, and he for her. Their intensely mature relationship far surpasses many of the superficial romances in young adult books. With a devotion and a certainty that belies their age, Tris and Tobias face each obstacle as equal partners who will do anything and everything to keep everyone safe in unthinkably dangerous world. ","Parents need to know that Insurgent -- the second installment in a  dystopian trilogy that began with the best-selling Divergent -- follows a brave young heroine and her equally fierce, devoted boyfriend. Like most thrillers set in a futuristic, fractured society, this sequel has a lot of fraught situations, violent encounters, deaths, and the constant threat that the protagonist or her boyfriend will be killed or injured. While the language is mild, this book ups the romance from a few kisses to several passionate make-out sessions and even a declaration of love. Some teens (considered of age in the book) drink, and Tris is slipped a drug that loosens her inhibitions and makes her giddy. Many characters are killed or hurt, but in the end, there are thought-provoking messages about the best way to ensure a peaceful but productive society.

The Accidental Highwayman,Bandits and faeries mix in rollicking fantasy series debut.,"THE ACCIDENTAL HIGHWAYMAN is the tale of Kit Bristol, an 18th-century English orphan who gets into assorted troubles. He's spent much of his youth as a trick rider in the circus of the man who bought him from the workhouse, then becomes the servant of an impoverished nobleman who wins him in a card game. Soon, he makes the unwelcome discovery that his master is actually the gentlemanly highwayman Whistling Jack -- and is forced to assume the bandit's identity when the man unexpectedly dies. Before too long, he's sent on a mission to rescue a kidnapped faery who's being forced into an unwelcome marriage. It's love at first sight, but the path of true love never runs smooth. In this case, the hapless Kit must contend with two warring armies of magical beings and most of British law enforcement, hell-bent on ridding the roads of robbers, along with all the complications of first (and star-crossed) love. ","Tripp's 18th-century narrative style may be a barrier to action-oriented or younger kids, but Kit's lively, self-deprecating style and the illustrations and constant ups and downs will appeal. The horse Midnight and the French bulldog Demon will draw fans of their own. The conclusion averts some immediate problems but sets the stage for many more.","Parents need to know that The Accidental Highwayman is the first installment in a new young-adult series by Ben Tripp, previously known for adult zombie fiction. He takes on the tale and the voice of 16-year-old 18th-century orphan Kit Bristol and, as the title says, ""his horse Midnight, a Mysterious Princess, and Sundry Magical Persons Besides"" -- a crowd-pleasing mix. There are battle scenes in which characters die, and Kit himself is under constant threat of being arrested and hanged. That -- and the moral ambiguity of gentleman bandits -- aside, there's little problematic material here. Kit is sent on  mission to rescue a kidnapped faery, and the two fall in love, but they never kiss, because kissing is a fateful matter in faery culture.

Dog Gone,A gentle way to talk about separation worries.,"Otis, the dog narrator, has been left by his owners for a stay at the Misty Meadow dog hotel. The place is nice and the dogs are friendly, but it is not home, and that is the only place Otis wants to be. He remembers a story that his owner Lucy told him about a cat and two dogs who make it back home over wild, strange country. Otis decides to do the same.
On his adventure he bolts over thorny hedges (hay stacks), fords dangerous rivers (a creek), and escapes fearsome beasts (a group of sheep munching disinterestedly on a hillside). Deciding that his escape has been ill advised, he returns willingly to the friendly safety of Misty Meadow where he stays happily until his owners return.
","Otis is an endearing character, and his situation will resonate with children. For a child a similar situation might be staying at Grandmother's house, and running away may be hiding at the back of the yard or venturing to the end of the block, but the feelings involved are much the same. Like a loved child, Otis has the strength of character that comes from feeling that despite some difficulties, the world is ultimately a good place.
Third in a series by British author/illustrator Amanda Harvey, the story takes place in the pastoral setting of the lush English countryside, painted in soft pastel watercolors. There's lots of activity in the illustrations and the animals' faces are expressive, but it is Otis' ears that make the strongest statement. They most often stand straight out from his head, giving him a look of comical intensity. He appears friendly yet alert, gullible but determined.","Parents need to know that separation is a recurring issue in childhood. With the emotional remove of a canine hero and a whimsical adventure that ends in safety, this sweet story offers a gentle way to talk about separation worries with a young child.

"The Hazel Wood, Book 1",Captivating tale of teen thrust into the world of folklore.,"As THE HAZEL WOOD begins, 16-year-old Alice has spent life on the move with her mother, Ella, trying to stay one step ahead of deadly streaks of bad luck. When Alice learns that her reclusive grandmother, cult author Althea Proserpine, has died, she's doubly traumatized by the disappearance of Ella. Desperate for advice, she teams up with Ellery Finch, the super-rich superfan of Althea's lone book, Tales of the Hinterland. Together, they head toward Alice's ancestral home, a place filled with often-deadly magic.
","Fairy tales and folklore drive the plots of many modern novels, but it takes a special kind of magic to create such a witty, suspenseful, and insightful novel as this one. With The Hazel Wood, debut novelist Melissa Albert weaves a literary spell over her readers, using the elements of fairy tales to tell a gripping tale of the supernatural. Alice is an acerbic and prickly protagonist, but you can't help but root for her as she attempts to unravel the secrets of her birthright. Smart, funny, and emotionally compelling, The Hazel Wood is a magical debut.","Parents need to know that The Hazel Wood is a contemporary fantasy novel steeped in the traditions of European folklore. The book chronicles Alice Proserpine's quest to find her grandmother and rescue her mother in the magical world known as the Hinterland. It includes some violent scenes -- a throat-cutting, an attack by a giant bird, an ax murder -- but death isn't always permanent in the Hinterland. There's occasional strong language, with perhaps a dozen uses of ""f--k"" and ""s--t."" Sexual content is minimal (a character talks about how he lost his virginity), and a teen ppears stoned in one scene.

Kenny and the Dragon,Reluctant Dragon remake has less charm.,"Kenny, a book-loving rabbit, meets a dragon named Grahame, who loves Shakespeare and creme brulee. This gentle dragon and Kenny soon become friends. Kenny's only other friend is George, an elderly badger who runs the local bookstore. When the townscritters discover that there's a dragon living nearby, they turn to George, a former knight, to slay it. Now Kenny must figure out a way to keep his two friends from fighting.
","As a remake of the original, this book is both unnecessary and lacking in the charm (not to mention originality of concept) that made Grahame/Shepard's book so appealing. The movie industry has long indulged in remaking older movies. With occasional exceptions, this has been a disaster. It's not hard to see why: if the original movie was worth remaking, it was probably pretty darn good to begin with, and the update usually loses the qualities that made the original a classic. Fortunately, this trend has mostly been confined to film -- until now. Tony DiTerlizzi, half of the team that created the original and delightful Spiderwick Chronicles has chosen to rewrite and re-illustrate the classic The Reluctant Dragon by Kenneth Grahame (whose most famous book is the classic The Wind in the Willows), and illustrated by Ernest Shepard (famed for his brilliant drawings for Winnie-the-Pooh).
For reasons best known to himself, DiTerlizzi's update includes changing all the characters to animals -- perhaps he just enjoys drawing them more. He also includes many references to The Reluctant Dragon, including naming the main character Kenny, the dragon Grahame, the hill where they live Shepard Hill, and even working in a direct mention of the original book. Standing on its own, this story is pleasant and enjoyable. But the original is still in print (alas, there are many newer editions done by other illustrators -- look for the edition with the original, delightfully insouciant Shepard drawings that so clearly show the virtues of simplicity) -- so why not get it instead?","Parents need to know that there is not much to worry about here. Adults smoke pipes and drink ale.

"The Voyage of the Dawn Treader: The Chronicles of Narnia, Book 3","Thrilling, thoughtful Narnian quest.","Edmund and Lucy are visiting their disagreeable cousin Eustace when they find themselves falling into a painting of a great ship: The siblings have returned to the magical country of Narnia, reuniting with Prince Caspian, and Eustace is along for the ride. The children join Caspian and his shipmates on an epic journey into the unknown Eastern Seas. They are seeking seven Narnian lords who had been banished by Caspian’s usurping uncle years ago – and perhaps, even, the land of Aslan, the mystical lion who watches over Narnia. The adventurers encounter enchanted islands, strange merfolk, a fearsome sea serpent, and more, testing their character and their loyalties time and again.
","This fantasy is a classic for good reason. The characters are true and heroic, and their epic adventure sees them escape one danger after another through cleverness, wisdom, sheer bravery, luck, and divine intervention. Even the least appealing characters – the miserable Eustace, later the wearying Dufflepuds – are treated, ultimately, with kindness and affection. C.S. Lewis draws out the good in his characters as they are challenged, and without fail the diverse companions prove their worth and mature further with each stage of the adventure. Throw in strange creatures, curious enchantments, and mysterious, magical islands, and you have an irresistible yarn. Young American readers will find it a bit dated: Originally published in 1952, it’s very British in tone. But kids who are up for the adventure probably will be charmed by those quirks.","Parents need to know that this high-seas journey into the great unknown is a satisfying fantasy that can be appreciated on its own or as part of the seven-book Chronicles of Narnia series. Originally the third book in the series, it's the fifth book in editions that are ordered along the chronology in the stories. There are perilous moments, including encounters with a sea serpent and a terrifying Island of Dreams, but it all serves the story, and drawn weapons are put away without being used. The Christian theme that runs through the series is very clear here: The adventurers seek the country belonging to Aslan, a Christ-like figure who rules over Narnia in the form of a lion (though he also takes the shape of a lamb here). Aslan tells the children they must learn to know him by another name in their own country. That said, the book can easily be enjoyed as a fantasy without a Christian interpretation.

The Castle Behind Thorns,"Delightful, gentle fantasy stresses power of forgiveness.","Thirteen-year-old Alexandre (Sand) wakes up one morning to find himself inexplicably in an abandoned castle, where every single object in it has been broken. Cut off from escape by the magical thorns that surround the castle, he begins to repair things he'll need to survive alone for what could be months, years, or even his whole life. Soon a girl about his age appears, and they set about finding a way to survive. But, to escape the powerful thorns and get back to the lives they should have had, they'll have to put more than the broken castle back together.
","THE CASTLE BEHIND THORNS is an enchanting fairy tale parents will enjoy reading aloud as much as kids will enjoy reading on their own. Its pace is gentler and quieter than the excitement in author Merrie Haskell's Handbook for Dragon Slayers. It's less about adventure and more about learning, growing, and the power of forgiveness. Suspense is created early on and sustained at a consistent level that keeps the story engrossing without over-the-top action.
Stellar language such as ""furniture slumped like beasts fallen to the hunt""; the mysterious and poetic recollections of Perrotte's dream-like afterlife; and themes of family, memory, and forgiveness will make multiple readings a rich, rewarding experience.","Parents need to know that The Castle Behind Thorns by Merrie Haskell (Handbook for Dragon Slayers) is a charming, delightful fairy tale. The pace is gentle but there's enough suspense to keep the pages turning. The scariness comes more from a creepy atmosphere than from violence, monsters, or fast action, but blood is mentioned a few times. The 13-year-old heroes, Sand and Perrotte, are strong role models, and the themes of family, memory, and the healing power of kindness and forgiveness will give kids lots to think about.

Going Bovine,"Edgy, quirky road trip fantasy skewers reality TV and more.","When Cameron, a high-school slacker, finds out he has fatal mad cow disease, he sets out on an epic quest to find a cure and maybe save the world, too. Accompanied by his friends -- Gonzo, a dwarf, and Balder, a Viking god disguised as a long-suffering yard gnome (don't ask) -- Cameron faces an increasingly bizarre series of misadventures involving a punk angel, New Orleans jazz musicians, and snow globes in this very postmodern retelling of Don Quixote.
","Fans of Bray's Gemma Doyle trilogy (A Great and Terrible Beauty) will recognize the alternative-world fantasy elements in this book, but any resemblance ends there. Though the middle section stretches too long as Cameron moves from one absurd situation to the next, readers will stick with Bovine for its male bonding and humorous send-ups of fast-food restaurants, self-esteem, and reality shows. The over-the-top elements ultimately serve a quieter purpose, asking teens to ponder what it means to really live an engaged life.","Parents need to know this wacky novel features a teenager's death, a punk angel, and plenty of edgy behavior by teens (condom-free sex, drinking, pot-smoking, and running away).

The Glittering Court,"Fashion, romance rule in fun alternate-colonial-era fantasy.","Unlike Richelle Mead's popular vampire series, THE GLITTERING COURT is not a paranormal fantasy but a quasi-historical fantasy set in a world that is at once familiar and completely fictional. Lady Elizabeth Witmore is a countess living in tony Osfrid (think London) with a great title and name but no fortune. Faced with a financially desirous but emotionally disastrous betrothal, Elizabeth decides to take drastic steps. She decides to steal the identity of her maid Adelaide and take her place in the Glittering Court -- a business venture that takes beautiful working class girls and transforms them into true ladies to be married off with the newly rich colonists of Adoria, across the sea in the New World. The one hiccup is that Cedric, the handsome recruiter who initially signed up Adelaide, knows the truth. Since Elizabeth-now-Adelaide is already nobility, she has to pretend she's less refined than she really is to pass as a former lady's maid. In the Glittering Court, Adelaide hopes for a profitable match with someone who doesn't disgust her, but as she and Cedric, who has his own secrets, get to know one another, she realizes she wants more than comfort and status out of life.
","This alternative universe historical fantasy is fun for romance fans. The Glittering Court is  mix of The Selection and Jane Austen with period fashion, forbidden romance, and a storyline about brides for hire. Mead fans might be confused at first, because there are no hunky vampires or fairies in sight, but this story, while unevenly paced, still includes her signature features, such as an opposites-attract/forbidden romance, female friendships that support and encourage the protagonist, and a whole lot of conflict in the way of the happily ever after. Fashionistas or those who simply love intricate details about fabrics, hemlines, and corsets will be especially thrilled with the amount of time Mead spends describing the various elaborate dresses.
Adelaide isn't terribly self-aware and makes some cringe-inducing decisions, such as thinking that leaving one loveless marriage betrothal for an organization that basically sells brides to the highest bidder will help her situation. Of course, without that impulsive situation the readers would never get to experience the frontier world of Adoria, where there are all sorts of fortunes to be made, ethnic and religious differences to encounter, and a looser set of rules to abide. The pacing is uneven, nd Adelaide, while likable enough, is less interesting than her best friends in the Glittering Court, Tamsin and Mira, who's a less desirable ethnicity (and complexion) than the rest of the girls. Each of them gets her own companion novel, and these characters show a great deal of potential fter Adelaide's story is resolved.","Parents need to know that The Glittering Court is best-selling author Richelle Mead's first in a proposed fantasy trilogy set in an alternate fantasy universe that resembles colonial America's relationship with England. The story tackles mature themes such as marriage, sexism, religious freedom, and colonialism but also features the forbidden romance and intrigue that one would expect from the popular YA novelist. The ""bride for hire"" theme is already a mature idea, but the romance is very subtle at the beginning. Toward the end, however, the romance turns into a passionate marriage and an ongoing sexual relationship. The violence includes references to religion-based murders, an assassination attempt, a near rape that's defended with a knife, and other violent encounters.

Peter Pan in Scarlet,Official Peter Pan sequel doesn't soar.,"Some 20 years have passed since the events chronicled in Peter Pan. The Lost Boys have grown up, little Michael has been killed in WWI, and the rest have careers and families. But dreams are leaking out of the Neverland, disturbing their sleep, and leaving all-too-real souvenirs. Gathering together with Wendy, they decide they must become children again and fly back to Neverland to find out what's wrong.
Once there they discover a land that is deteriorating, but they forget their mission. Finding the derelict ""Jolly Roger"" and a treasure map on board, they join Peter on an expedition to find Hook's treasure. They are joined by the mysterious Ravello, a circus-master, who becomes Peter's butler. But in Neverland, adults can only mean trouble.
","McCaughrean has sucked out the joy, the effervescent spirit, the humor -- everything that made Peter Pan a classic -- and produced a plodding slog of a story. The original may have been dark, but it was never dreary; it was woven of dreams and fairy dust. But here a scene involving quicksand is all too emblematic.
The journey to and up the Neverpeak alone is so tedious and sprawling, not to mention grinding and miserable, that many readers who have hung in that far will drop out. Now Peter seems like a crabby old man who grumbles about pains in his joints. This joyless, forced march badly needs an infusion of happy thoughts.","Parents need to know that several characters nearly die but don't, and there I's a lot of threatened violence -- though little actually occurs.

On the other hand, Maya believes the only way to avoid her mom's plans to force her into Scientology is to get pregnant and marry the first man she meets. But when her marriage begins to take an unexpected turn, Maya must figure out how to handle her family being torn apart.

","Hopkins creatively uses verse and prose to connect her characters, explore bisexuality, and highlight the power of perseverance.

Although Ariel doubts herself and her identity throughout The You I've Never Known, her decision to break free from her dad's manipulation and abuse is empowering.

There's lots of gritty violence, but no sex, drugs, or language problems to worry parents (at least those who don't worry about gritty violence). And there's the fantasy of winged flight, which is always a kid-pleaser.

When the town reacts with horror to the news that the most sinful children will be playing the holiest roles, the pageant director becomes even more determined to make it work. Even though they look more like trick-or-treaters than Bible figures, the Herdmans don't ruin the pageant; instead, they improve it, and give the story a surprisingly sentimental ending.
","THE BEST CHRISTMAS PAGEANT EVER has an edge -- but presented from a child's point of view, the edge is funny, irreverent, and irresistible. Author Barbara Robinson's prose is fast, clever, and very funny. But exercise parental discretion; not all parents will want their children exposed to the antics of the main characters or will appreciate the liberties taken with what some people may consider sacred ground.
Though it's all in fun, it offers a subtle but important lesson: Just because you're bad doesn't mean you're hopeless. The Herdmans voluntarily go to the library to research their parts in the play, and Imogene's final scene shows an unlikely side to her character that's sure to stir up compassion and encourage mature readers to reflect on its meaning. Because the story centers on a popular Christian childhood event, some of the meaning and irony may be lost on readers unfamiliar with Christmas pageants. But everyone can appreciate the universal humor and underlying meaning.","Parents need to know that this is a unique and entertaining spin on an age-old tale.

The Anatomical Shape of a Heart,"Solid teen romance with smart, artsy heroes.","No one knows THE ANATOMICAL SHAPE OF A HEART better than Beatrix. She's always been fascinated by anatomy and wants to channel her artistic talent into illustrating anatomy for medical textbooks. She also knows that any hope she has of going to college hinges on winning an anatomical art competition for the $10,000 grand prize. On her way home late one night, she meets Jack at the bus stop, and sparks immediately fly between them. Jack has his own secrets, though, such as the identity of his ""lady friend"" he visits at the hospital regularly. As they spend more time together, Jack starts drawing Beatrix out of her comfort zone, encouraging her to take more risks in life. But how do you know if the risk will be worth it?
","Veteran author Jenn Bennett's YA debut introduces an engaging, quirky heroine whom teens will enjoy rooting for as she navigates the thrills and confusion of her first serious relationship. Romance fans will sigh right along with Beatrix t swoon-worthy Jack, and they'll easily relate to the ups and downs of her life on the verge of big changes. Author Bennett also touches on art and its place in society, and although this is not deeply explored, it will provide teens with food for thought.
The plot moves along well, and the sights and moods of San Francisco are ably evoked. It's a solidly written, enjoyable story but lacks a real spark or fine touch that could elevate it above the romance genre.","Parents need to know that The Anatomical Shape of a Heart is a teen romance about a smart, artistic 18-year-old and the mysterious, slightly dangerous boy she meets one night taking the late bus home. There's kissing and making out with some detailed description, and teens have sex although it's not directly described. The importance of always using a condom is stressed. A past incident involving a stabbing and a suicide attempt mention blood, and a cadaver donated to science is described with some detail but no gore; otherwise there's no violence. Narrator Beatrix is a positive role model, but she goes against her mother's wishes in pursuit of an art project, sneaks around, and lies about what she's doing. Eventually the truth comes out, and Beatrix is grounded. Jack is the ideal boyfriend, loyal and supportive. He's a graffiti artist; we learn he has a strong, positive motive for it. There's lots of strong language, most often ""s--t,"" ""ass,"" and ""crap.""

Seconds Away,Teen thriller sequel lacks punch of previous volume.,"Hot on the heels of the events in Shelter, Mickey Bolitar stumbles into a new set of mysteries. The odd neighborhood \""Bat Lady\"" hints that his presumed-dead father may still be alive and somehow connected to a 90-year-old Nazi known as \""the Butcher of Lodz.\"" Then Mickey's friend Rachel is shot and her mother killed under strange circumstances. Aided by his misfit schoolmates Spoon and Ema, Mickey tries to unravel the truth, without causing more suffering.
","SECONDS AWAY may pick up only a few days after the events in Shelter, the first volume in this thriller series, but it can't match the energy and inventiveness of its predecessor. The central mystery -- Who shot Rachel and her mother, and why? -- does not develop compellingly. The overarching mystery of Mickey's dead father, however, takes a few intriguing twists, but that's clearly a plot line that won't be tied off until some future installment. There's also a growing plausibility factor in Second Away: Does absolutely everyone in this town harbor a mind-blowing secret? Author Harlan Coben is a pro at this kind of suburban intrigue, but he's going to need to step up his game next time.","Parents need to know that Seconds Away is the second novel in a series featuring high school sleuth Mickey Bolitar. It picks up in the immediate aftermath of the Shelter, the harsher human-trafficking-themed first installment. It's possible to read Seconds Away as a stand-alone thriller, but some of the impact of its details will be lost. The main mystery revolves around a shooting that leaves one of Mickey's friends wounded and her mother dead. The second plot thread concerns the death of Mickey's father and its connection to the Holocaust. Much of the violence happens off-scene, but a gunfight leaves a major supporting character grievously wounded. A cache of drugs is used as a plot point. There's very little cursing (""hell,"" ""damn"") or sexual content.

Penny from Heaven,Slow but intriguing Newbery Honor book.,"Penny's father is long dead, and no one will tell her what happened to him. She lives with her mother and grandparents, who live a rather dull and straitlaced life. But her father's family lives nearby -- grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins -- and they're anything but straitlaced.
Her cousin/best friend, Frankie, wants to be a criminal -- just like his incarcerated father. Penny's Uncle Dominic lives in his car by choice and harbors a sad secret. Her Aunt Gina and her grandmother, Nonny, live in the same house but can't stand each other, so they have separate kitchens. And now, much to Penny's chagrin, her mother is dating the milkman. PENNY FROM HEAVEN includes an Author's Note, a family album of photos, and resources.
","The first half of Penny from Heaven is a slow but evocative and nostalgic slice of life in a '50s Italian family in suburban New Jersey. It makes reference to the fear of polio, saying ""swell,"" rooting for the Brooklyn Dodgers, eating abundantly, etc. Getting through this part takes patience and real reading experience.
Things pick up in the second half, when a terrible accident leads to secrets revealed and families reconciled. It's all beautifully written and fascinating (though perhaps more to adults than to most kids), and it reveals a true but little-known historical event.","Parents need to know that the central event of this story is a rather gruesome injury in which a child gets her arm caught in a wringer machine. She then meets other injured children in the hospital. There is some mention of wife abuse, and one parent is an alcoholic.

Waiting Is Not Easy! An Elephant & Piggie Book,Giggly series installment taps into common kid frustration.,"Piggie has a surprise for Elephant. But ... he'll have to wait. Elephant tries to be patient, but his laments get louder and louder (""GROAN!"") until he can't take it anymore, especially when it starts to get dark outside and he worries that he won't even be able to see Piggie's surprise. Piggie finally tells him to look up in the dark sky. That's when Elephant, sharing a moment of awe and wonder with his best friend, realizes all the waiting was well worth it.
","The title alone automatically connects with kids: WAITING IS NOT EASY! -- especially in Elephant's case, where you have no idea what you're even waiting for. Elephant gets to moan and complain in all capital letters, and kids will adore the chance to shout out ""GROAN!"" Mostly because that's not the behavior most parents allow while waiting at the post office or in line at the grocery store. Let out those loud Elephant groans as you rush through the pages, new readers, and enjoy the awesome surprise at the end -- while your adult listeners gently remind you that Piggie is right: There are plenty of things worth waiting for.","Parents need to know that Waiting Is Not Easy! is another spirited installment in Mo Willems' award-winning Elephant & Piggie series for beginning readers. Like I Am a Frog, it's a straightforward lesson with a small surprise at the end, delving less deeply than usual into the two mismatched characters' endearing friendship. Still, it's a humorous lesson for kids often frustrated by waiting and what kinds of rewards waiting can bring. As in the other Elephant & Piggie books, the story's told in conversation bubbles and in the exaggerated expressions of the animal characters, making it easy for parents of kids with social delays to explore conversation tools and feelings.

"The Dragon King: Otherworld Chronicles, Book 3",Fast-paced Arthurian adventure series ends with a flourish.,"THE DRAGON KING is the third and final book in the The Otherworld Chronicles, a series about two middle-school gamers literally sucked into the video game Otherworld. As the tale concludes, they go from adventure to adventure, trying to find the Holy Grail to save Kay and Artie's father. Finally they must do battle with Merlin, who's amassed an army of gruesome creatures in a bid to take over the world. The characters have matured and grown through their quests; now they take on the responsibility of saving the world.
","The Dragon King is an easy, action-driven read, especially good for gamers looking for something else to do. Through these adventures, we've seen Artie and his friends mature from video game-obsessed middle schoolers to heroes on a mission to save the world. In the process, they discover there's more to life than gaming; they learn to be part of society and help one another. This final installment focuses more on the adventures and quests than on the characters, but these likable kids still will engage readers. ","Parents need to know that The Dragon King, the third and last volume of the Otherworld Chronicles, is a good read, full of action-packed adventures and battles as the heroes fight to save the world. Though there's some gruesome violence involving scary mythical beasts, dangerous quests, and the ever-present, super-evil Merlin, the descriptions aren't overly graphic or gory. (The violence level is comparable to that of an E10+ video game.) Middle-school readers will appreciate the way ordinary characters use their brains and expertise to conquer evil.

Making Up Megaboy,A disturbing novel with no easy answers.,"13-year-old Robbie Jones has just murdered an elderly storekeeper, and no one knows why. He always seemed like just a nice, normal kid. Through interviews, news reports, and court documents the author reveals the story, but not the reasons. In this brief book with no easy answers, readers are left with much to think about.
The facts are beyond dispute. On the day he turns 13, Robbie Jones takes a gun out of his father's dresser, rides his new bicycle to a liquor store downtown, and fatally shoots the elderly Korean storekeeper. The only question remaining is why--and Robbie won't, or can't, say.
In documentary format, through news reports and through interviews with Robbie's parents, friends, classmates, teacher, principal, counselor, and lawyer, as well as with the police officers and the victim's widow, author Virginia Walter lays down the facts and opinions, then leaves readers to draw their own conclusions.
","This disturbing novel has no easy answers or neat endings. It seems straight out of the headlines, and is likely to provoke great discussions. In short takes, Virginia Walter captures the essence of the personalities involved: Robbie's hard-nosed dad, his bewildered friend, his self-involved classmates. Only Robbie, who is silent throughout, remains an enigma, his feelings expressed only through his comic strip, ""Megaboy.""
The author only hints at what might have led to this tragedy. No one seems to know this child at all -- not even his parents. The book's short, easy-to-read format, as well as its tough-minded attitude, compelling subject, edgy computer-generated collages, and Robbie's superhero drawings, will appeal to reluctant readers. The graphic design makes the book look both unique and cool, and enhances the ripped-from-the-headlines feeling.","Parents need to know that this edgy story revolves around the killing of a store owner by a 13-year-old boy.

Thank You and Good Night,A perfect charmer of a bedtime book; the real deal.,"In THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT, a bunny, a bear, an elephant, and a girl enjoy a sleepover. They jump on the bed, play hide-and-seek, bounce a balloon, and listen to a bird sing a lullaby: ""Sweet sleep, Sweet sleep, Sweet sleep."" Before bed, the girl reads the animals stories and suggests they all make a list of what they were thankful for that day. In the last picture, they're cuddled asleep together in bed, with the animals now looking like they might be the girl's stuffed animals.
","If you're looking for a goodnight story to read and savor again and again -- sweetly perfect nd as gently paced as childhood itself -- look no farther. A bunny, a bear, and an elephant walk into a sleepover, assisted by a little girl. They dance a chicken dance, have a funny face contest, and enjoy something good to eat (""Nom Nom Nom.""). When it's time for bed, they sleepwalk down the hall (""Z Z Z""), and the girl reads them stories, then suggests that they all say what they're thankful for, which triggers a lovely rhyme that's simple and satisfying.
Loving references to familiar classic children's books abound. The bunny in the blue striped pajamas is lifted straight from Goodnight Moon, and his name, Clement, must refer to Clement Hurd, that book's illustrator. The bear's name, Alan Alexander, is taken from A. A. Milne, author of Winnie the Pooh, also evoked by a picture of a bear carried aloft by a balloon. And the elephant's name is Jean, à la Jean de Brunhoff, author of Babar. It's not at all necessary to catch these references to enjoy the book, but Thank You and Good Night is squarely and happily in their classic company.","Parents need to know that Thank You and Good Night is by Caldecott Honoree and prolific author-illustrator Patrick McDonnell (The Monsters' Monster), whom parents might also know from his syndicated comic strip Mutts. This gem of a bedtime story about a bunny, a bear, an elephant, and a girl enjoying a sleepover is a lovely tale about friendship, with a dash of gratitude. The animals in the art look miniature, and the book itself is child-size nd friendly. The gentle story is a perfect prelude to sleep.

","Kids who love everything about space would love to be in Davey's shoes, of course, but Davey's not that excited -- which is the subtle humor here. Davey, despite being in an intergalactic family helping to settle Mars, is bored. His parents do what parents everywhere do: tell him to go outside and find something to do. So off Davey trots with his mechanical dog, Polaris, to find adventure on the dusty red planet. Not subtle at all is the artistry; stand-out color-saturated tributes to style and design. From the family's Airstream rocketship to Davey's Chuck Taylors, the retro-minded story manages to be gorgeous enough to almost lift the hum-drum story. The keyword there is ""almost.""

Mick Harte Was Here,Difficult life-death questions are meant for discussion.,"Phoebe tells the story of her brother Mick's death in a bicycle accident, and its aftermath. Tracing the unpredictable, lonely path a bereaved family travels toward recovery, Barbara Park paints a very individual but ultimately universal portrait of memory and grief with acute insight. Through funny and poignant memories, eighth-grader Phoebe Harte introduces her brother Mick, 10 months younger, and tells the story of his fatal accident. She then describes her reactions and experiences over the ensuing days. She attends his funeral, interment, and memorial service, and gradually is comforted by her best friend, her spiritual intuition, and her family. As she struggles with her feelings, she makes a re-entry into daily life and school, finding setbacks, support, and, finally, stability.
","This book is a demonstration of the devastating power of simplicity. With breathtaking economy and precise strokes, Barbara Park brings Mick Harte and his sister Phoebe to vivid life. And because Park gives Phoebe such a distinct, genuine voice, her reactions are real and familiar. Park moves the reader back and forth, from Mick to his sister, gradually disengaging them, separating the tightly interwoven strands of their lives, until Phoebe can stand alone. The author makes hardly a misstep; all the book's elements are tied together with enormous skill. Even the lesson about wearing bicycle helmets is made so directly and simply that it doesn't seem at all preachy. In fact, when the father wishes he had made Mick wear his, it's one of the book's most moving moments.
Not all young readers will want or be able to handle the questions Park asks. But those who do will find that, with MICK HARTE WAS HERE, ""here"" is a lasting place in their hearts.","Parents need to know that Mick Harte Was Here deals with the death of a sibling.

The Graveyard Book Graphic Novel: Volume 1,Gorgeous adaptation catches all the magic of original novel.,"On the night the rest of his family is murdered, a toddler escapes to a nearby cemetery, where he's taken in by the kindly ghosts and other fantastic creatures who live there. Named ""Nobody Owens,"" the boy grows up in the graveyard. His curiosity and restlessness lead him into a series of adventures: Nobody and a female friend enter a hidden crypt and discover what lies beneath a magic hill; he and the ghost of a young witch tangle with a crooked pair of treasure seekers; a band of ghouls kidnaps Nobody and threatens to turn him into one of their kind; and Nobody joins the dead and living alike as they ""dance the Macabray.""
","This graphic novel adaptation by P. Craig Russell (with the assistance of six other accomplished artists) brilliantly redefines the story for a different medium.
The episodic plot is perfect for this kind of collaborative project, with each chapter offering a different look that stills feels part of a unified vision. Rowdy ghouls, ghosts from various eras, a kindly vampire, and a vigilant werewolf are only a few of the supernatural characters depicted with elegance and wit. Readers will want to get their hands on Volume 2 as quickly as possible.","Parents need to know that The Graveyard Book Graphic Novel: Volume 1 is the first half of a comics adaptation of fantasy author Neil Gaiman's ward-wining middle grade novel, The Graveyard Book. It begins with the murders of a young family and follows the surviving toddler as he makes his escape to a nearby cemetery, where he's named ""Nobody Owens"" by the ghosts who live there. Each chapter of this volume presents Nobody with a new adventure, including a trip into an ancient crypt, a kidnapping by a trio of ghouls, and a chance to ""dance the Macabray."" Although there are some scary and horrific elements, most readers are unlikely to be disturbed, thanks to the warmth and clarity of illustrator P. Craig Russell's layouts and the finishes by six other accomplished artists. There's some vague flirting with a ghost, no swearing, and no use of alcohol, drugs, or tobacco.

"City of Bones: The Mortal Instruments, Book 1",Exciting start to teen fantasy series in urban setting.,"Clary goes to an all-ages nightclub, and there encounters Shadowhunters and demons, all of whom are invisible to everyone else. This encounter, and her mother's subsequent kidnapping, brings her into a shadow world of age-old warfare between the Shadowhunters and the demons, from whom they protect humanity. Clary discovers that her mother and her own past are not what she thought, and that she is intimately involved in a power struggle among the Shadowhunters.
","Teen urban fantasy is a popular sub-genre, and this first installment of a new series has all the essential elements. A city-dwelling teen discovers an invisible world of magical beings and monsters living hidden among us, and that she has a place and power within that world due to a past that has been kept hidden from her. It's the variations the author wrings out of the formula, and the attitude, that make the difference. Author Cassandra Clare doesn't go for the teen sarcasm and black humor (much), nor the hip urban cool, of some of the other members of this small but growing category.
Instead, she offers an intriguingly complex world with reams of backstory involving numerous characters, creatures, factions, and relationships. In addition to the various sides among the Shadowhunters, there are vampires, werewolves, faeries, warlocks, and others, each group with its own politics, powers, and agendas. Then she wraps it all up with exciting action told in vivid, occasionally melodramatic, but always engrossing, prose that sweeps the reader along and makes even the exposition fascinating.","Parents need to know that there is lots of fantasy violence with swords and knives here, including some that is gory, with fountains and puddles of blood, throat stabbing and cutting, etc. Also, there's some kissing. This is the start of a series that explores some compelling ideas, such as what makes a family and whether it's OK to hide a big part of yourself away from loved ones, even if it's in the name of protecting them from harm.

"City of Fallen Angels: The Mortal Instruments, Book 4",Exciting entry in bestselling series has creepy cult stuff.,"At the end of book three, characters were in the Glass City of Idris after a big battle with demons and the evil Valentine. Back in New York City, characters try to re-imagine their lives. Clary is training at the institute for the first time, Simon is trying to live a semi-normal life (while hiding his stash of blood from his mom), and Jace is working on his relationship skills with Clary while trying to remind himself that he isn't like the psychopath who raised him. But evil forces are at work, with Jace invaded by strange and violent dreams where he's afraid for Clary's life, Simon visited by a very old and very powerful vampire who nearly compels his alliance with her, and Clary using her ruin-creating abilities to uncover a cult that tampers with the unborn like they did with her own brother.
","After the nail-biting, demon-demolishing, evil-vanquishing conclusion to the first cycle, book four had a lot to live up to, and it builds pretty slowly but steadily. It surfaces new evil forces to fight and draws on quite a bit of relationship angst to propel the characters -- maybe a bit too much when it comes to Jace and Clary. While the cult activity and dead claw-handed babies will definitely give readers the creeps, CITY OF ANGELS keeps the series full of light moments and humor for contrast.  And the new villains are just as complex as Valentine, but female this time, a fun twist and a reminder of the series' appeal to both boys and girls.","Parents need to know that this is the fourth book in the bestselling Mortal Instruments series -- and the first in a second cycle that will include three books. While the previous installment was full of demon-Nephilim battles, this one takes the violence to a creepier place with the Nephilim (humans who have angel blood) fighting against some serious cult activity: demon-worshipping to the point of sacrificing babies to the cause. This leads to nightmarish imagery of dead babies with claws for hands. Consistent with the other books, there's plenty of blood -- drunk by vampires, sacrificed, spewed everywhere, and mixed to create superbeings. There's also more sexual energy in this one (mostly straight but some gay as well); using protection is mentioned but characters don't have sex. Main characters grapple with feelings of isolation, self-loathing, and self-doubt but come together to fight against evil and reaffirm their important connections to each other.

Chicken Soup With Rice,Each month has a poem with the soup theme.,"This is a nice early work by children's book all-star Maurice Sendak. Every month in the year has a poem with the soup theme. The simple illustrations add warmth and character to the poems.
","Sendak delivers a charming little book of poems and creatively maintains the chicken-soup-with-rice theme all the way through. Each poem is well crafted, and the artwork gives the book a warm feeling, much like chicken soup itself. There is a child's sensibility at work in the notions of a whale spouting chicken soup and of floating down the soupy Nile.
After a few readings, the words ""chicken soup with rice"" become like good-luck pieces that can be deployed on many occasions: Anything that's genuinely worthwhile, anything that sees you through -- that's chicken soup with rice.

Author Robin Stevenson brings to life the early years of these influential people, including Harvey Milk, Dolores Huerta, Nelson Mandela, Helen Keller, Janet Mock, Rosa Parks, Malala Yousafzai, Autumn Peltier, Martin Luther King Jr., and more. With an emphasis on the childhood experiences that helped make them activists, the book highlights history and the fight for justice from a perspective close to kids' own experience.
","Filled with inspiring stories and anecdotes, this collection of brief biographies is a great, relatable look at the lives of activists whose lives young readers might not fully understand. Kid Activists: Tales of Childhood from Chanpions of Change looks at each activist’s focus, then at the childhood events that helped form his or her ctivism. While some events (such as the life of a newly freed enslaved person) are glossed over and given an overly positive spin, that same positivity can help inspire readers to overcome obstacles and follow their dreams, and to stand up for what they believe in.","Parents need to know that Robin Stevenson’s Kid Activists: True Tales of Childhood from Champions of Change is the sixth book in the Kid Legends series.

Commodore Perry in the Land of the Shogun,A vivid picture of Perry's historic mission.,"America's nineteenth-century courtship of Japan thrust the isolated Land of the Rising Sun reluctantly into the midst of world affairs. Through deft depictions of personalities, clearly explained events, and colorful sidelights, this excellent history paints a vivid picture of U.S. Navy officer Matthew Perry's historic diplomatic mission.
 ","Rhoda Blumberg's lucid writing, immediate in tone and easily accessible to bright youngsters, springs from deep knowledge and research. Had they landed on another planet in 1853, Americans could scarcely have encountered a culture more alien to their own than that of 19th century feudal Japan. Blumberg brings this strangeness to life, spelled out in such details as banquet menus, table manners, and jarringly different social customs. Blumberg has produced a thorough treatment of a little-known but pivotal event in world history. Unfortunately, the grace of her approach is undermined by the book's poor picture quality. Although the pictures are well chosen and fascinating, they often are poorly reproduced. Even so, beguiled by tales of samurais excitedly riding a toy railroad bestowed by the Americans, of Dutchmen made to jump and dance to amuse the shogun's court, of the Japanese fashion for black-painted teeth, young history hounds will eagerly gobble up this excellent account.","Parents need to know that despite inadequate illustration, this book manages to make an historical action, largely motivated by trade opportunities and diplomatic ambition, both exciting and understandable.

Thus Luke, his family's third child, has lived his entire life in hiding, and now that a new development is being built on the edge of his family's land, he can't even go into the yard anymore, nor can he go into rooms with windows, as the neighbors grow suspicious if the shades are pulled all the time.
This miserable, isolated existence is interrupted when he discovers another shadow child living in a nearby house, and risks his and his family's lives to meet her. But this other shadow, Jen, child of an official with the Population Police, is less passive about her situation -- she is organizing a protest march to try to free the shadow children.
","What makes this stand out among others in the dystopian genre (at least for children) is that it doesn't shy away from the bleakness or hopelessness of Luke's situation. It also doesn't void the logical consequences of the situation the author has set up. The first third of the book chronicles Luke's living situation, as his loving but terrified family increasingly constrict his world until he lives almost entirely alone in a windowless attic room, and readers can feel the arid claustrophobia of his life. But she does it in a way that is fascinating and suspenseful.
Along the way the author raises many issues -- none of them are simple -- which makes this a good choice for reading groups and book discussion groups. It's never clear, for instance, how real the overpopulation crisis really is, and both sides put out exaggerated propaganda that makes it hard to find the truth. There are no easy answers or pat endings here.","Parents need to know that some kids may be disturbed by the death of a major character. Otherwise there's not much to be concerned about here.

The Wee Free Men,Delightful but too violent for young kids.,"Tiffany Aching lives on a farm, is good at making cheese, and is a girl of uncommon sense. She also dreams of becoming a witch (\""She preferred the witches to the smug handsome princes and especially to the stupid smirking princesses, who didn't have the sense of a beetle.\"").
	The Wee Free Men are the Nac Mac Feegle, tiny, redheaded, blue men in kilts, who speak in a thick Scottish brogue Pratchett invented for them, specialize in \""stealin' and drinkin' and fightin'\"", and are perfectly described by one Amazon customer as \""foul-mouthed Scottish smurfs.\""
	Tiffany sets out to rescue her baby brother, who has been kidnapped by the Queen of Fairyland, armed only with an iron frying pan and a book of sheep diseases, and accompanied by the brawling, boisterous Nac Mac Feegle. But more than her brother is at stake. This Fairyland is not the nice kind, full of buttercups and Tinkerbelles; it is a place of endless winter where nightmares come true, and where a person can be trapped in a dream forever. And it is encroaching on Discworld, threatening to absorb it.
	A witch named Miss Tick offers Tiffany some terrific advice: \""If you trust in yourself ... and believe in your dreams ... and follow your star ... you'll still get beaten by people who spent their time working hard and learning things and weren't so lazy.\""
","Pratchett has an uncanny ability to create an unusual and creative adventure. He then combines it with layers of symbolism, myth, and cultural detail, and then wraps the whole package in the kind of sparkling wit that rewards intelligence and careful reading. There's a reason he's such a favorite with gifted children and teens; as with his other novels, readers will come away from this feeling that they've had something to chew on, a full and varied banquet, not the usual thin gruel of ordinary stories.
There are many delightful creations here, primarily, of course, the Nac Mac Feegle themselves. Whenever they're on stage, the story fairly sizzles with wit and invention. Equally wonderful, though in a very different way, are the flashbacks to Tiffany's Granny Aching, an old sheepherder whose hardheaded wisdom is the product of a life lived in the chalk hills, and is reflected in her granddaughter. And Tiffany herself, busily clanging monsters with her frying pan while wondering about magic, is a more than winning heroine.","Parents need to know that if you like doing accents and voices, this could be a great read-aloud.

Jane and the Dragon,Girl-knight story is predictable but enchanting.,"When Jane says she wants to be a knight, everyone laughs at her, that is, except for the court jester. She does not let that stop her. Whenever she gets the chance, she practices, secretly watching and learning from the real knights. One day, she gets her chance and does the unexpected.
","This cute little story matches a spunky girl character, a wistful jester, and a confused dragon with a challenging message to do the unexpected. The outcome is predictable, but it's an enchanting tale all the same. With her wild red hair billowing out from under her helmet, the armored Jane shows a kind of good-hearted, undaunted spirit that is meant to inspire. Still, she feels like just one of us. We expect her to make mistakes, get herself in trouble, and come out a hero in the end.
Author Martin Baynton hoped to ""reverse the treatment of fairytale heroines,"" and he has succeeded with Jane. His colored-pencil drawings are soft, yet strong just like his main character. And his message is a good one.","Parents need to know that breaking out of expected roles is the challenge here. It's all positive and kid-friendly ... and not just for girls!

Vampire Academy,"Sexy, mean-girl vampire story has strong language, bullying.","Rose and Lissa are on the run for some mysterious reason. Readers soon find out why when Rose, a dhamphir (guardian to the Moroi vampires) and Lissa, a Moroi vampire princess, must return to St. Vladimir's Academy. At school they discover more mysterious and secrets within St. Vladimir's walls. Rose and Lissa encounter something else at the academy, too: forbidden romance.
","VAMPIRE ACADEMY imagines a different kind of vampire, but the story is pretty much Mean Girls meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Rose thinks she has a sarcastic wit but it comes off more nasty than funny. She's extremely vain about her looks and thinks about boys 24/7. Her only redeeming quality is that she truly cares for her best friend, Lissa, and wants to protect her at any cost. Yet, her ""I'm better than you"" attitude's hard to get past. Granted Rose has some kick-butt fighting skills, but there are plenty of terrific heroines in other YA books. Vampire Academy seems more about high school life with vampires and a mystery thrown in the mix -- not much to sink your teeth into.","Parents need to know that Vampire Academy is the first book in a popular series by Richelle Mead, featuring two girls at St. Vladimir's Academy: Lissa, who discovers she's a vampire princess, and Rose, a vampire guardian committed to protecting her. A movie adaptation hits theaters in February 2014. While the trailer for the movie makes it looks like a comedy, the novel's dark and full of Mean Girls-style high school bullying. The characters bicker from beginning to end, especially Rose.

Valkyrie Rising,Norwegian mythology adds interest to muddled fantasy.,"Sixteen-year-old Ellie Overhold vacations at her grandmother's home in Norway for the summer, and her 18-year-old brother, Graham, and his popular friend, Tucker, join her. Tucker has always been kind to Ellie, but their relationship has been hot and cold. While in Norway, she meets Kjell, a young college student and friend of her grandmother's, who warns Ellie that something is happening in Norway -- young men are disappearing, taken by the mythological female warriors known as Valkyries. At first, Ellie doesn't believe the rumors, but when she comes face-to-face with a powerful Valkyrie named Astrid, everything changes. Ellie discovers that she herself is a Valkyrie and that her grandmother has been keeping the truth a secret. When Graham and Tuck arrive, Ellie is worried that she can't keep them safe from being taken. When more and more young men start to disappear, Ellie must take matters into her own hands -- and either join the Valkyries or fight them.
","VALKYRIE RISING IS a book readers will either love or hate. Though the novel's filled with teen angst, fantasy, supernatural elements, and romance, its heart is Ellie. Elements of Norse and Celtic mythology are few and far between. The book could have used much more of the supernatural, the history of the Valkyries, and especially Norweigian culture to make the plot more interesting. Ellie feels a pull toward the Valkyries, who look like supermodels, but only because she's one of them. She never questions why she feels drawn to the violent havoc the Valkyries cause, or her new magical powers, or if Valkyries are even real.
It's wonderful that her brother watches out for her, but his overprotectiveness borders on creepy and goes way beyond sibling advice. Ellie's a big girl and proves that she can handle herself. But Graham, 18, never gives his 16-year-old sis credit and treats her like a child, which irks Ellie, and just might irk readers. The romance between Ellie and Tuck is sweet but feels forced. Early in the novel, Ellie complains about Tuck's egotistical behavior and track record with women, but his supposedly flirty behavior is never shown because from the beginning Tuck only has eyes for Ellie. Valkyrie Rising has an intriguing premise, but falters in the execution.","Parents need to know that Ingrid Paulson's debut novel, Valkyrie Rising, is about 16-year-old Ellie Overholt, who visits her grandmother in Norway for the summer. Young men around the country are disappearing, and the rumor is that mythological Valkyries -- females who capture young men to be dead ""soliders"" to take to Valhalla, the afterlife, ruled by Odin -- are responsible. Teens, including Ellie, drink beer and get into physical fights. There's some strong language (""damn,"" ""crap,"" and ""sh--t""). Ellie is uses knives and swords and is shown how to use a gun. There's a romance between Ellie and Tuck, 18-year-old brother's best friend, with brief kissing.

"The Towering Sky: The Thousandth Floor, Book 3",Mystery series finale is a little less everything.,"In THE TOWERING SKY, teens Avery, Leda, Rylin, and Watt are still reeling both from their friend Eris' death and from the shocking events at the gala party in Dubai a few months ago. And they're still trying to hold on to their own, and one another's, deepest secrets. But when the police open a murder investigation into the death of Mariel, the air starts to get a little thin for the teens circulating in New York's highest society. How long can they keep things under wraps?
","This third and final series installment is not quite as compelling or suspenseful as the first two in the series. Maybe that's because by now, the structure of The Towering Sky seems pretty familiar, and so do the characters. That being said, there's still an intriguing whodunit element with a surprising resolution.
The Towering Sky lso concentrates more on the characters as they reach maturity, and teens will relate to and enjoy rooting for Avery, Leda, Watt, Rylin, and even Calliope as their perspectives broaden and they learn the hard way how to make better choices for themselves. They still inhabit an intriguing vision of the future, with all the cool tech and luxurious lifestyles that go along with it, but it's less glamorous this time. The kids are learning that there are no trappings or gadgets that can make things right when you've wronged yourself and others.","Parents need to know that The Towering Sky is the last of the popular The Thousandth Floor trilogy of mysteries set among glamorous, ultra-wealthy teens in the year 2119. The many characters exhibit good and bad behaviors, and most mature by the end into decent people capable of making better decisions for themselves. Alcohol and drug use are mentioned a few times but not described directly. Lots of kissing and light making out is described briefly; one romantic relationship involves adopted siblings, and a couple of same-sex relationships aren't remarkable in this future setting. Murder and suicide as central plot elements mean attacks, death, drowning, falling from a skyscraper, and blood are frequently mentioned, but there's no gore or detailed descriptions. Teens use a made-up device to inhale drugs called a ""halluci-lighter."" Swearing is rare and includes ""s--t,"" ""bulls--t,"" and ""a--hole.""

Sidekicks,Fun superhero saga with coming-of-age themes.,"After Scott Hutchinson (a.k.a Bright Boy) was adopted \ by benefactor Trent Clancy (a.k.a Phantom Justice), he was trained to become Phantom's super-fast, super-strong sidekick. But when an embarrassing incident involving his yellow tights is caught by TV cameras, Bright Boy begins to rethink not only his costume but also his entire life. Perhaps it's time for him to stop simply being a supportive diversion during Phantom's heroic capers. But life quickly grows complicated as Bright Boy tries to stand on his own: Is Phantom truly on the side of good? Can he make his own decisions and still fulfill his obligations to the people who have raised him? And how can nearly invisible Scott get noticed when he is not wearing his Bright Boy costume and fighting for justice? A clever twist involving his nemesis, Monkeywrench -- the sidekick to the book's main villain -- and Jake, a bully at school, brings all the action to a head in a story that involves romance, an attack on corporate greed, the triumph of good over evil, and some old-fashioned coming-of-age themes. 
","The writing is fast, funny, and irreverent in a way that tweens will love. There are many twists and turns to keep them engaged: Readers will think they know who to root for, but then the author throws them a curve, taking his story to a whole new level involving corporate greed, high technology -- and a moral dilemma. Teens can enjoy this as a comic book without the drawings, or they can immerse themselves in the deeper issues about identity, the media's influence, and how tricky it can be to tell the good guys from the bad guys. ","Parents need to know that this superhero-themed book has comic book-style violence: Superheroes knock each other around, a woman is thrown off a roof, high-tech weapons are used to stun, short-circuit nervous systems, and otherwise cause mayhem, etc. There is some borderline swearing (like ""pissed"" or ""holy crud""), and the book starts out with Bright Boy's embarrassment over becoming aroused while saving a young woman -- something that's pretty obvious given his yellow tights. Later, he falls for his nemesis, and there is some kissing. As in most superhero stories, good triumphs over evil just before the bad guy almost wins. But this book offers a deeper message about how hard it can be to tell the good guys from the bad. And on another level, this is a story of a boy who gains self-confidence, and his own identity, with the help of a good friendship.

Pennyroyal Academy,"Brave kids, scary monsters, lessons galore in series debut.","As the story opens, a girl who doesn't remember her name is wandering through an enchanted forest with trees trying to kill her. After a narrow escape, she reaches PENNYROYAL ACADEMY, where princesses in training learn not to become selfish divas but to practice courage, compassion, kindness, and discipline and battle evil forces side by side with knights. Soon dubbed ""Evie"" by her classmates, she struggles to survive a demanding program that emphasizes rigorous military training as well as fashion sense and noble character. Along the way, she discovers that the beloved family she's left is at the top of the Academy's enemies list.
","In his first departure from animation scripts, author M.A. Larson makes way, way too many trips to the office of clichés and central casting. Mysterious orphan swept off to magical academy, where weird, cranky, but lovable teachers prepare him/her for cosmic struggle -- we've seen this before and done better. Snobbery involving the purity of one's blood, ditto. Stock characters, from incognito royalty and plucky commoners to witches who live to destroy all happiness, are thick on the ground, as are repetitions of didactic points. Characters are fond of the expletive ""bloody.""
And yet there also are laugh-out-loud funny moments and heartfelt emotion. Some situations may be comically incongruous but lead to some interesting discussion. For example, Evie's classmate Basil, who against all odds is in training to become a princess -- because, after having 22 sons, his mom gave up trying for a girl and sent her youngest off to the Academy. As the school term ends, it's easy to care enough about several of the characters to want to know what happens next.","Parents need to know that Pennyroyal Academy, the first novel by prolific TV-cartoon writer M.A. Larson, best known for his work on My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, was first envisioned as an animated series, and it shows. A good deal darker than My Little Pony, it retains a bit of cartoonish sensibility, from moments of pure slapstick to inexorable repetition of ""courage, compassion, kindness, discipline."" It offers plenty of uplifting themes, from living up to the mantra to being true to yourself and being part of a team. It also presents many scary scenes, as well as developing tension as a central character discovers that her birth and adoptive families are mortal enemies, and she sees her loved ones fall prey to their would-be killers in violent combat. There are mean girls, complete with fights that involve sympathetic characters; a character is kissed against her will and later kisses a boy she likes. Several characters use the word ""bloody"" with gusto, which probably will bother British parents more than American ones. Following the first year of a three-year Academy program, the book offers some appealing, conflicted characters and sets up a multi-volume story arc.

This year, however, Nickel Bay Nick's strangely absent during the run-up to Christmas, leaving people in the economically struggling town depressed. Enter Sam Brattle, an unhappy, troublemaking 11-year-old with a lengthy rap sheet of petty crimes, ranging from shoplifting to minor vandalism and assorted cruel pranks. When Sam mistakenly damages the house of a neighbor, the aggrieved Mr. Wells makes a deal with him: In exchange for Mr. Wells not reporting Sam's vandalism (and other crimes) to the police, Sam must spend his Christmas vacation helping Mr. Wells, who's temporarily in a wheelchair following an accident. The crusty, exacting Mr. Wells is the shadowy Nickel Bay Nick, but this year his injury prevented him from working his stealthy money magic around town. Now Sam must become Nickel Bay Nick, and in the 12 days after Christmas, learn the tricks and techniques Mr. Wells, a former government spy, imparts to complete various missions in Operation Christmas Rescue, while keeping his and Mr. Wells' identity a secret. Nothing's easy, and there's a chance of failure at every turn. But over the course of two weeks, the two learn much about each other and themselves.  
","Nickel Bay Nick is an engaging, well-written, and sometimes funny book that has plenty of heart. Author Dean Pitchford (best known for Captain Nobody) effectively puts us inside the mind of fifth grader Sam, who narrates his adventures as a secret Santa, dispensing hundred dollar bills to strangers around the town of Nickel Bay at the behest of a mysterious neighbor. Sam's a complex kid -- physically fragile due to a heart transplant when he was 4; unhappy at home since his mother divorced his dad; strongly influenced by a criminally minded eighth grader who's always getting him into trouble; filled with self-loathing and lacking in self-confidence.
All of Sam's fears, insecurities, doubts, and anger come through in his narration, but so does his fundamental goodness and compassion. His adventures in clandestine philanthropy are exciting and at times nerve-wracking, as each mission to give away the money becomes progressively more difficult. The unpredictable ending's highly satisfying and surprisingly emotional. Kids will have no trouble relating to Sam's ups and downs.     ","Parents need to know that Nickel Bay Nick is a Christmas-themed coming-of-age novel about troubled and troublemaking Sam Brattle, 11, who gets a chance to redeem himself when he's blackmailed by a mysterious neighbor to perform secret acts of charity around their economically depressed town.

But deep down he's a sensitive soul, and the story of how he salvages his small town's Christmas, told in his voice, charts his slow transformation in the right direction. There's considerable fibbing and subterfuge involved in his good deeds, and he does some extremely dangerous things (such as hanging onto the back of a moving truck), but the cause is noble and it's hard not to root for Sam, who's had a lot of tough breaks in life.

","Calling all misfits and outcasts: CONFESSIONS OF A HATER is a dream for anyone who wished she'd had a secret handbook to transform from a nobody to a somebody. Only to walk away, of course, when she realized the cool crowd wasn't really that cool -- nd then go start her own cool crowd. Though the premise is a bit of a stretch, the dilemmas and concerns here are as old as time -- or, at least, as old as the invention of the teenager -- and this book confronts them all: the cliques, the popularity contests, the embarrassments, the struggles with identity, and the endless battles over appearance. It's all told in a really funny insider voice that seems to get it. Parents, however, may take issue: There's a very mature voice here, one that cusses up a storm, casually breaks the rules (and a handful of laws), experiments with (oral) sex and alcohol use. To say nothing of characters dotted throughout who joke about weed or shoplift clothes. There's a teen pregnancy that nearly undoes a girl, and another who will come undone over her affection for snorting Adderall.

However, the narrator is an intelligent, analytical teen girl who exhibits high self-awareness, ultimately framing these so-called rites of passage thoughtfully, with an understanding of the inherent risks and consequences.

A Long Way from Chicago: a Novel in Stories,A hilarious look at summer in the country.,"In a series of related short stories, siblings Joey and Mary Alice from Chicago spend a week each summer with their eccentric grandmother in small-town Illinois during the Depression. She convinces a nosy reporter that a dead old reprobate was really a Civil War hero, gets local delinquent bullies the comeuppance they deserve, outwits the local sheriff to help poor drifters, helps a young couple to elope, and arranges for her oldest adversary to keep her house when the bank wants to repossess it.
","Richard Peck's comedy is his best since Bel Air Bambi and the Mall Rats. Filled with the kind of detail that can only come from memory, the book is blessed by Grandma Dowdel, a true original. Sharp-tongued and peppery, like so many of Peck's central characters, she reveals her heart to her grandchildren through action, not mawkish blather.
In a succession of summers she outwits the press, local hooligans, and the sheriff, all for the benefit of the town and its residents, whom she appears to despise. Her clever, no-nonsense approach to problems is wicked and original, though often mystifying to her grandchildren, and Peck's perfect blend of outrageous humor and unsentimental warmth make this a true rarity in comic novels -- one that is at once richly funny, memorable, and deeply satisfying.","Parents need to know that this novel is set in small-town Illinois during the Great Depression, which might prompt some curiosity about the time period and the challenges it created for American families.

That means that, as a role model, she's meant to be taken with a grain of salt.

Cinderella Smith,Spirited tap-dancing girl loses her shoe but not her spunk.,"Part dancer, part detective, part your typical klutzy kid, Josephine-Katherine Smith (called Cinderella because she has the habit of losing just one of her shoes) is a little out of step with a few of her dance class friends, who are also her second grade classmates. They are becoming cliquish and a bit too obsessed with piercing their ears and shopping. Cinderella doesn't fit in with them like she used to, and she is not sure what to do about it. When she gets the lead in the dance recital, things look a bit rosier ... that is until she loses yet another shoe, this time her new red tap shoe. One moment she wavers between embarrassment and hurt feelings; the next moment she feels funny and strong. Luckily, she and the new girl become friends, linked together by their spunky spirits, creative independence, and love of adventure. They both have problems to solve, and together they make life work.
","Cinderella Smith has an indomitable spirit, and a voice to go with it; that, and the author's ability to make that voice sound so natural, is exactly what makes this book  winner. A few issues are not addressed, or only partially solved, but overall the story hangs together well and offers good lessons, an entertaining adventure, and a realistic glimpse into the life of a spunky second grader in the throes of changes brought on by just plain growing up.","Parents need to know that this is not a retelling of the traditional Cinderella fairytale. True, this Cinderella does lose her shoe (more than once), and that does add to her problems. But there are no princes, pumpkins, or fairy godmothers involved. This is a growing-up tale of a spunky second grade girl who is figuring out how to fit in with family and friends as they all go through inevitable changes. Though not all the loose ends are connected, there is nothing objectionable or particularly complicated about the story, and it would be a good chapter book for younger school-age readers. A sequel will be published in April 2012. ",9,,8,Stephanie Barden,Coming of Age,Great Girl Role Models,Fiction,Harper,"April 26, 2011",8 - 12,148,,"July 13, 2017",Diane Goode,,,,,

Where the Watermelons Grow,Book about mental illness in family is real yet reassuring.,"WHERE THE WATERMELONS GROW begins in a hot, dry, North Carolina summer, when Della's mom starts to exhibit symptoms of serious mental illness. She's schizophrenic and has had episodes before, and Della tries desperately to help her mother get better by taking over household chores and caring for her baby sister, Mylie. But Mama increasingly ignores her parental responsibilities nd worries unreasonably that someone's trying to hurt her girls. The family lives on a working farm, which also has its stresses. The severe drought is harming the crops. Can Della help Mama get better? Should she confide in her best friend or other concerned adults, or should she keep Mama's illness secret? Will Mama ever be a normal mother? If not, who can Della turn to for help and support?
","This realistic but hope-tinged story, told by a girl whose mom is seriously mentally ill, manages to truthfully present the challenges while conveying a warm tenderness. In Where the Watermelons Grow, the fraught family situation feels tense in many ways. Mama neglects her responsibilities, leaving baby Mylie screaming in her crib, her diaper soiled. And because she worries someone's trying to harm her daughters, she nearly harms them herself, withholding food from Mylie, and soaking the kitchen with bleach. Author Cindy Baldwin makes clear that Della feels responsible for Mama's illness, since its onset was pregnancy. And she ventures into even more uncomfortable, unsettling territory when Della fears she herself may be genetically programed for schizophrenia later in life. Mama may get better, but she'll never be reliably normal. That's the unrosy reality Della has to live with.
Still, Baldwin has crafted a sweet, tender book. She stocks the story with folks who rally around Della, never abandoning her in her distress. Baldwin also has a lovely writing style that exudes warmth. She describes Mama, ""her face relaxing and softening, the way the sky unwrinkles after a thunderstorm."" And she's alert to the sensual detail of weather and place. ""The sky above me was moody, with thick stacked-up gray clouds that blew across he sun like sailboats."" This loving treatment of a difficult childhood never feels heavy nd is filled with light.","Parents need to know that Where the Watermelons Grow, by debut author Cindy Baldwin, is a novel about a family touched by mental illness. It's narrated by 12-year-old Della in a first-person, soft, North Carolina drawl. Della's mom, who's diagnosed with schizophrenia, is experiencing a psychotic episode, and Della and her dad brace themselves since they've been through this before. The stakes are high, the subject matter serious, and author Baldwin doesn't gloss over the challenges. Still, there's a palpable warmth to the material, and Baldwin doesn't leave Della without support. In this small Southern farming community, white and black families are friendly and close, and many in the community offer help, infusing the book with hope and a reassuring feeling of connection. The book might be resonant for kids experiencing other types of family challenges, for instance other health crises or alcoholism, and can be a sweet, thoughtful read for all.

Let's Do Nothing,Fun book about combating boredom; great for lazy afternoons.,"After playing every sport and board game, painting, reading, baking cookies, and so on, two boys decide to do nothing, and they find out just how difficult that can be. Sal has helpful ideas, but Frankie just cannot pull it off.
","Doing nothing is harder than it looks; most kids who read this book will agree, and they will enjoy seeing just how hard these two boys try. The format is simple: Sal comes up with an idea and sets the stage. Frankie has problems. They pretend to be statues, but pigeons land all over Frankie. They try standing as still as trees in a forest, but a dog comes along and marks Frankie's tree. Together they are a real comedy team, and kids will love the humor.

City Boy,AIDS orphan adjusts to the country life in Malawi.,"Sam has grown up in the city of Blantyre, Malawi. Now that both of his parents are dead from the Disease (AIDS), he must go to live with his Aunt Mercy in the rural village of Mandingwe, where there is no electricity in the thatched-roof, brick huts there. Sam, used to using a computer and the ways of the city, finds it hard to adjust, and he is not warmly welcomed by his cousins, some of them also orphans who live with Mercy, and who are contemptuous of a \""city boy.\"" Feeling excluded, unwanted, and unable to adjust, Sam decides he must leave.
","The author evokes a powerful empathy for his protagonist, which makes the eventual resolution, though a bit contrived, all the sweeter.
The story of the city mouse and the country mouse dates all the way back to Aesop, and is apparently one of those archetypes that crosses cultures and continents. This particular variation takes place in modern Malawi, a tiny country in southeastern Africa of which few American child readers will have heard, and where the difference between city and country is extreme. Author Jan Michael's first book to be published in America thus may serve as an introduction for many readers to a distant and exotic place that is both like and unlike their own homes and experiences.
	Though some of the cultural specifics will be unfamiliar -- Sam is, for instance, expected to share everything he owns with his cousins, which will surely horrify American children who will consider it grossly unfair -- the feelings he experiences are universal. His misery and despair at his seeming rejection, after losing not only his parents, but also his home, school, friends, and everything he knows and understands in the world, will touch even cynical hearts.  From the Book:
	""I mean"" -- Sam was puzzled -- ""where should I put my clothes?""
	Now it was her turn not to understand. ""Put them?""
	""Well, where do you put yours?""
	Enock pointed at the wall. Nails were driven into it, and from them dripped a small assortment of trousers and shirts and cloths. ""Ezza and I share a nail.""","Parents need to know that the main character, like many others where he lives, has been orphaned by AIDS, and there is a brief mention that it is caused by sex.

Roses and Radicals: The Epic Story of How American Women Won the Right to Vote,Exciting history of women winning voting rights.,"ROSES AND RADICALS tells the story of the long struggle to give American women the right to vote. It began in 1848 after a small group of women decided it was time to organize a ""public meeting for protest and discussion"": a Women's Rights Convention. Led by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony (""I forged the thunderbolts,"" said Stanton, ""and she fired them""), the movement that grew out of the convention would be met with disbelief and outrage at the very suggestion that the female sex might have the capacity to cast a vote. After the Civil War, the movement would survive  nasty split over whether the fight for African-American voting rights was being prioritized over the vote for women. Anthony and Stanton would actually oppose the 15th Amendment, which gave the vote to African-American men. By the 1870s, the slow march of states granting women suffrage began, but the opposition was fierce and often violent. Women were arrested, jailed, and sometimes physically assaulted by their jailers. But they persisted, and in May 1919, Congress passed the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote in every state ... but only if that amendment was ratified by 36 states. In August 1920, it came down to a 24-year-old legislator in Tennessee, who arrived for the vote carrying a letter from his mother in his pocket. He voted ""Aye,"" and the 19th Amendment became law.
 ","With the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment being celebrated in 2020, this is a timely, accessible, and unflinching look at the fight to give women the vote. Roses and Radicals packs a lot of history into 168 pages, but it's filled with memorable personalities, and numerous sidebars break up what might otherwise be heavy historical going for some readers.","Parents need to know that Susan Zimet's Roses and Radicals: The Epic Story of How American Women Won the Right to Vote is the story of the seven-decade-long battle for women's suffrage and the remarkable and courageous women who never gave up the fight. Moving from the Women's Rights Convention in 1848, which demanded the vote for women, to a cliffhanger ending in 1920, when a single vote in the Tennessee House of Representatives ratified the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, it's an exciting read that should easily captivate even readers who think they don't like history.

"Sophia, Princess Among Beasts","Fast-paced, exciting, but often sketch-like fantasy morsel.","In SOPHIA, PRINCESS AMONG BEASTS, Sophia is roused from her daily grooming routine by a maid's frantic declaration: The ruthless King Ares and his army, who have already conquered and destroyed many kingdoms, are headed their way. Sophia's father, King Leonidas, doesn't want Sophia to worry, but he still outfits her with cavalry when she makes her weekly trip to the impoverished village. Despite all this protection, there's nothing the soldiers can do about what Sophia finds there: people dying of a plague called the Seep, and a teen named Rafael with a good throwing arm. He pelts Sophia with dung and yells about the poor treatment of the villagers until he's thrown in the dungeon. That night an assassin sneaks into the castle and kills the king just as Sophia falls ill with the Seep. When she wakes up, she's in a carriage driven by ghoulish creatures. She's suddenly in a world populated by beasts, including the fearsome King Ares, with no idea how to get home again.
","This small morsel of a fantasy will get you through family vacation travel swimmingly with warring kingdoms and monstrous creatures and assassins and a trip to another dimension. Sophia, Princess Among Beasts packs a lot in 320 pages. For regular fantasy readers, though, it may not be enough to make the book memorable. A trip into an unknown world seems sketched out rather than filled with the lush detail it deserves, and few answers are given as to how the worlds are intertwined.
Sophia has a nice metamorphosis in the story while other characters feel one dimensional. The beasts, who seem to be from a hodgepodge of various myths and folklore, are also hard to picture. Many get killed off so fast, though, that the confusion passes, the book ends, and you pick up another James Patterson bestseller for the ride home.","Parents need to know that Sophia, Princess Among Beasts is a teen fantasy from the prolific James Patterson and contributor Emily Raymond. Sophia is a 17-year-old sheltered monarch who loses both her parents (her mother from childbirth, her father is stabbed). She falls ill from a plague that kills many from the local village and travels from the living world to another plane with violent beasts. In both worlds, there are a number of stabbing deaths (human and beast) in the gut and neck and even the eye from daggers and swords, with blood and gore described. One murderer explains how the blade sounds going into human flesh with delight. One stabbing death happens after a sexual assault. There's also a battle with deaths and injuries from swords and arrows. Other mature content includes drinking le and wine mostly at dinners -- Sophia has honey wine once. ""S--t"" is uttered a few times. Sophia begins the story as a naive princess who doesn't understand the harsh lives the peasants lead. By the end, she embraces her role as a just, brave, and compassionate queen.

He'll be captured by pirates, chased by terrible burrowing creatures, and forced into confrontations with angels.
","Railsea is no run-of-the-mill adventure at sea; it's full of strange creatures, odd quests, treacherous pirates, and weird settings.

Puffin, an average bird who's faced with saving his island in the Arctic Circle when the cruel owl Rozbell appoints himself king of the Owl Parliament, reversing the democratic laws that have been in place since the Cod Wars. Rozbell's unfair tax on fish first affects Lockley's wife, Lucy, and then threatens to starve all the inhabitants of Neversink. With the help of his good friends, a walrus and a hummingbird, Lockley embarks on a quest to find the exiled goddess Sedna and ask her to bring the fish back to Neversink.
","Funny and upbeat, Barry Wolverton's well-written debut novel is full of the kind of details that will keep readers age 9 to 12 interested.

The Secret of Ferrell Savage,"Silly, fast-moving story of sleds and family secrets.","Now that he's 12, Ferrell Savage is finally old enough to compete in the Big Sled Race -- but he's even more interested in making an impression on his longtime friend, Mary Vittles. But a strange new kid named Bruce Littledood shows up at the race, and he has a bone to pick with him over some family history. Ferrell grudgingly goes along with Bruce's demand for a sledding rematch, but only to help Mary keep her family's past a secret.
 ","THE SECRET OF FERRELL SAVAGE is a fast, fun read. The thrills are minor -- readers will come very close to figuring out the big secret long before Ferrell does, but they'll enjoy the journey. The sledding scenes are highlights. The best parts, however, are Ferrell's sweet and awkward feelings for Mary.
The story is a little self-consciously silly: When Ferrell does online research, he confuses ""cannibal"" with ""cannonball."" And author J.

Hero,"True bravery, friendship in suspenseful tale for dog lovers.","Leo spends most of his time imagining he's a gladiator of ancient Rome, until he meets a dog called Jack Pepper. Jack has a knack for making friends, and soon the whole town knows and loves him but none more than Leo. Jack even pulls Leo out of a pond, which Leo fell in while doing something he knew was wrong. Somehow the wrong version of the story gets out, and the whole town thinks it was the boy who saved the dog instead. Leo feels terrible about the lie but doesn't know how to set it straight. One day, a huge sinkhole opens in the middle of town, right where Jack Pepper was waiting for Leo. Can Leo, who's only 11, help find and rescue Jack before it's too late?
","HERO starts out slowly, with frequent repetition of Leo's desire to be, well,  hero, becoming a bit heavy-handed. It also takes a while to create a real sense of place with the confusing use of U.S. vocabulary such as ""trash can"" in what has to be a small town somewhere in Europe. Things pick up considerably when Jack Pepper appears, and eventually author Sarah Lean displays a more authentic ear for dialogue. These flaws are unlikely to bother kids and tweens, though, especially dog lovers. The final third builds nicely, and the pages will keep turning.
The happy ending shows kids what real friendship is nd that growing up takes different kinds of heroism, not only bravery in battle.","Parents need to know that Hero is a dog-lover's story by Sarah Lean, the author of A Hundred Horses. Here Lean explores the human-animal bond through the relationship between 11-year-old Leo and his neighbor's dog, Jack Pepper, with lessons about honesty, true friendship, loyalty, and what it means to be a real hero. There's nothing of concern for bigger kids and tweens, but younger readers may be frightened by the random appearance of a sinkhole in the middle of town that collapses buildings. No one's injured, but Jack Pepper is lost, feared trapped in the bottom of the sinkhole nd possibly dead.

Soon they're knee-deep in a mystery involving the legend of Mothman and a ghost who warns of an impending disaster. Josie soon learns she's inherited the MOTHMAN'S CURSE and must make some difficult choices to protect the family and townspeople she loves, even if it means sacrificing herself.
","This engrossing, meticulously considered mystery with an ethical dilemma at its core takes a while to build up steam but ultimately will keep readers on the edges of their seats. The characters are clever and well-developed, and the family's close-knit loyalties and auction business (people who used to pretend things were haunted to make a buck now find themselves smack-dab in the middle of a real haunting) dd a fresh perspective to the genre.
It's fun to see how the kids solve the mystery and plot their survival, but readers also can wrestle with an ethical dilemma that may reveal their own thoughts about what it means to love and protect those closest to us. Throughout the novel, various characters react differently to the choice to save others or themselves. In the end, readers will find they've flexed some thinking muscles they wouldn't have expected from a tale about a flying mothman.","Parents need to know that Mothman's Curse is an engrossing sci-fi/fantasy novel that reimagines the alleged Mothman sightings reported in Ohio during the mid-1960s, Here, three siblings discover the curse and try to solve its mystery and save their small Ohio town.

Now, they're face to face with animals neither young man has seen up close before: horses that weigh hundreds of pounds. Instead of doing time in juvie, they're ssigned to the local city stables, where they learn to care for the horses and about the sport of polo. This opens a door to real opportunities and healing for Troy, but it could close the door on his lifelong friendship with Foster. Can Troy manage the out-of-control aspects of his life like he controls his horse, or will his problems overtake him like a stampede?
","In this moving, funny, and eye-opening story, readers are taken into a world of horse care and polo as Troy tries to navigate the lightening-fast changes in his life. Riding Chance is beautifully written, and the characters re well developed and feel like family, friends, and neighbors, from the Zumba-dancing grandma to the grief-stricken dad and the self-proclaimed mayor of the block. Readers (and their parents) will love the casual neighborhood vibe set against the trials of Troy's life. Author Christine Kendall brings normalcy to a series of extraordinary circumstances in the life of a typical city kid as he learns some great life lessons while caring for horses and learning the sport of polo. One thing Kendall does well is allow characters of various ages and genders to act as a moral compass for the main character. It's heartening to read a story that doesn't stick to the narrative of a lonely street kid with no adults or peers available for positive influence and guidance. It's also nice to bring a rural activity -- horse husbandry -- and an elite sport -- polo -- into an urban setting.","Parents need to know that Riding Chance is the story of Troy, a 13-year-old city boy, who gets caught for a petty crime but avoids Juvenile Hall by being assigned work duty at the city stables.

Her brother joins them, and they have even more adventurous fun together. When nightime comes, the unicorn seems to have disappeared into the sky, and the girl is forced to go in without her ... only to find a happy surprise when she goes to bed.
","This is the same cute, pig-tailed Pinkalicious character that readers will find in the first two Pinkalicious books. Simply drawn and very pink, she's nearly always smiling and seems confident in her way of seeing the world. In this case, it is a starry magical world of unicorns, flowers, clouds, and lots of pink and purple. Her unicorn, called Goldilicious presumably because of her profuse mane and tail of flower-strewn golden locks, changes from being a solid white animal to a more translucent one depending on who's in the room. Later, she merges with the clouds and shows up as a constellation of stars. The story makes several strong points though it's not so clever as the illustrations, and loses its focus at times. The strongest, most captivating scenes, both artistically and verbally, are those when Pinkalicious plays with Goldie.  And though the lesson is not crystal clear, parents and kids should find plenty to capture their attention, and discuss, in its very magically majestic pages. Kids who like this book should definitely read Pinkalicious, and maybe Purplicious by the same author. Pages are filled with pinkness ... and flowers and lace, which will appeal to most Pinkalicious fans.

For Darkness Shows the Stars,Riveting dystopian take on Jane Austen's Persuasion.,"In the dystopia of FOR DARKNESS SHOWS THE STARS, Elliot was born a Luddite, one of the privileged class of people who survived the Wars of the Lost and are allowed to own property and people. Her best friend has always been Kai, who was born to work for someone else. Kai decides to break free and follow his dream to become an explorer, and he invites Elliot to go with him. When she refuses because she feels responsible to the people who work on the land her family owns, Kai can't forgive her. Four years later, Kai returns, now a successful explorer; meanwhile, Elliot's father's farm is slowly sinking into ruin. Though Elliot still harbors deep feelings for her former friend, he seems interested only in showing her how well he's done. But the world around them is changing, and the new questions that arise about things they've always accepted as fact just may change them as well.
","Elliot is a richly developed character, and readers will sympathize with her difficult decision: being loyal to her family's workers or following the love of her life for new adventures.
Though the repetition of some of the concepts can get tiresome, and the language is occasionally imprecise, For Darkness Shows the Stars is a well-paced story that will keep readers quickly turning pages as more of the past is revealed and Elliot's dilemma becomes increasingly difficult. In an abundant field of dystopian YA literature, For Darkness Shows the Stars stands out because its underlying concepts are fascinating and relevant, and its characters are real and relatable.","Parents need to know that the dystopian world in For Darkness Shows the Stars is a feudal society in which the lords, called Luddites, for decades have eschewed technology and used mute, unintelligent people called the Reduced as their slaves. Questions about human rights and scientific progress influence many of the characters' life choices. The novel was inspired by Jane Austen's Persuasion, and readers of that classic will recognize many plot points (though not all: Most noticeably, the persuasion that drives Austen's Anne Elliot to make an important choice is absent here). But it's certainly not necessary to have read Persuasion to enjoy For Darkness Shows the Stars. As for sex and violence, prostitution and rape of the Reduced is alluded to but not discussed in graphic detail. Luddites are allowed to own guns, and at one point one character threatens another with a pistol.

Identical,Thick free-verse bestseller takes graphic look at incest.,"Identical twins Kaeleigh and Raeanne wear designer clothes and live in a nice house with their politician mother and district-court judge father. Despite the cheerful appearances for press conferences, though, the family is imploding under the strain of years-old lies. A car accident caused a rift between their parents. Now their mother is always gone and their father turns his drunken attentions to Kaeleigh. Raeanne, bereft of both her parents, keeps pushing the edge, whether it's sex, drugs, or alcohol. How far will both twins go to escape their dark secrets?
","With IDENTICAL, Hopkins sticks with her successful formula, writing a thick book of free verse poetry about abused, self-destructive teens. As readers tick off behaviors (bulimia --check, cutting -- check), more cynical readers might wonder why she didn't make the girls triplets so she could toss in a few more. The biggest complaint is the lack of editing -- there's simply no reason this needs to be 565 pages long. Even easy-to-read poems can't make up for redundant lessons and tedious action.
Both parents are caricatures, and the twins are preternaturally self-aware as they engage in overblown prose like ""Why can't he and I find/a way to accept each other, lose ourselves in all-/encompassing love, the kind that can save you?/ The kind that can glue/ all the fragments of two/ broken hearts together."" The novel's twist, while shocking, veers into soap opera territory.","Parents need to know that this young adult bestseller deals with mature subjects, including incest. Like Hopkins' other books, there is a lot of gritty material: One twin sister is sexually abused by her alcoholic father, while the other twin wishes she were the one he abused. To cope, the teens engage in dangerous behaviors, including cutting, trading sex for drugs, binge eating, bulimia, drug use (pot and hashish), and sadomasochistic sex. One twin tries to commit suicide. Parents are physically and emotionally abusive, and deliberately ignore signs of abuse. While this book can open up discussions about plenty of topics, including cutting, eating disorders, secret keeping -- and even book censorship, parents may find it useful to read the book along with their teens so they can help them through the difficult material.

Adele & Simon,Instant classic is like a kid tour of 1900s Paris.,"As Simon walks home from school, through the streets of Paris with his older sister Adele, they are both caught up in the excitement of the city. They stop by the grocer, the park, the natural history museum, a bakery, and an art museum. They even stop to watch a puppet show, a parade, and an acrobatic show.
Along the way they make new friends and meet old ones, and Simon loses one thing after the other. By the time they get home he no longer has his drawing of a cat, his books, scarf, crayons, gloves, hat, crayons, backpack, jacket, or sweater. However, they have had a day of happy adventures and pleasant memories in a world where friends, new and old, enjoy and help one another.
","Anyone traveling to Paris with their kids should definitely read this book, but armchair travelers will enjoy it, too. The adventures of ADELE & SIMON are memorable, the places they go are real places, and their book is the real deal. From cover to cover, it's a classic.
With gentle color and delicately drawn sketches, Barbara McClintock has painted so much realistic detail into each scene that the missing books or crayons or hat seem almost inconsequential ... even though, with careful searching, each can be found. With a slight twist at the end, the story develops in a simple and inevitable way. However, the artistic and historical richness of each page, including the covers and endpapers, make this a book that will be memorable to both kids and adults.","Parents need to know that this beautifully illustrated story contains adventure, art, and plenty to look at as Adele and Simon make their way home through the streets of Paris.

The Closest I've Come,"Absorbing, realistic, hopeful tale of teen in the projects.","In THE CLOSEST I'VE COME, high school sophomore Marcos Rivas is in danger of flunking the whole year. He definitely doesn't want to repeat 10th grade, but beyond that doesn't see much point in going to school. He'd much rather have a job so he can take his crush on a real date, get a cell phone that works, and maybe even a pair of shoes without holes. Other items on Marcos' wish list include proof that his mother cares about him, an end to the abuse he suffers at the hands of her boyfriend, and putting aside the tough facade he has to wear in the projects so that he can make real connections with people and find his place in the world. When he's placed in the Future Success after-school program, he starts to think that maybe he's smart after all, and maybe he's even a worthwhile person who can take control of his own destiny.
","Debut author Fred Aceves has written what he knows, and his honest look at life in the projects for 15-year-old Marcos is sometimes hard to take yet ultimately full of hope for the future. The Closest I've Come doesn't flinch from the realities of being not just broke but truly poor, as seen through the eyes of high school sophomore Marcos. Teens from any background will relate to Marcos as he struggles to understand his place in the world and seeks to make and keep deeper connections with those around him. They'll dmire his growing determination not to stay stuck in the projects forever, and easily relate to the typical teen struggles he faces, like getting up the courage to talk to his crush, or the pressures from a seemingly uncaring school staff and administration.
Aceves doesn't wrap everything up in a pretty ribbon or solve Marcos' problems with a magical solution; he keeps it real all the way through. But it is ultimately a hopeful story, and one that can inspire teens to care about themselves even when it seems like no one else does.","Parents need to know that The Closest I've Come is a coming-of-age story about 15-year-old Marcos that takes an unblinking look at life in a Tampa Bay, Florida, housing project. Violence includes physical and verbal abuse that Marcos suffers from his mother's boyfriend, with descriptions of the fear, dread, and pain that Marcos endures. He and his friends also punch, slap, and get into fights. Strong language is frequent and includes ""p---y,"" ""f--k,"" and racial slurs like the ""N"" word and ""spic."" Sexual content is mostly Marcos wondering what sex is like, based on the pornography he's seen. Teens mention women's body parts, and there are a few mentions of masturbation, such as wondering if it makes you a ""pervball"" or speculating that someone is ""fapping"" in a bathroom. Adults abuse alcohol and teens drink beer or malt liquor a few times. A friend starts dealing drugs, and Marcos is afraid for him. Marcos and Amy smoke pot once, though Marcos mentions a few times that he doesn't really like it. Marcos is  good role model despite some misbehaving, because he's smart and thoughtful and wants to feel more connected to the world and the people around him, and because he learns from observing and thinking about things as well as from his own mistakes.

Ella Enchanted,Highly imaginative twists on the Cinderella tale.,"When Ella was an hour old, the fairy Lucinda ""blessed"" her with obedience. Whenever Ella is told to do something, she must do it, including promising never to reveal her terrible secret. After her mother dies, Ella is sent to finishing school with her nasty stepsisters, Hattie and Olive. Hattie soon discovers the curse and takes advantage of Ella. Running away, Ella finds Lucinda and begs her to lift the curse, but the fairy refuses. Ella must go home and resign herself to a life of drudgery. Her friend, Prince Charmont, is in love with her, but Ella knows she can never marry him -- her curse would put him in grave danger. When he commands her to marry him, she struggles not to obey, cries out ""No""-and breaks the curse! At last the liberated Ella and her beloved prince can truly live happily ever after.
","ELLA ENCHANTED is a rich and imaginative retelling of the Cinderella story as a young adult novel. At last readers get a reasonable explanation for Cinderella's meek behavior. Poor Ella isn't a doormat; she is literally cursed with obedience. But she is a strong and intelligent role model -- instead of taking her misfortune sitting down, she marches off to rid herself of the troublesome curse.
Learning her worries and dreams gives readers a reason to root for her. Prince Charmant becomes more than a name as we read the letters he and Ella write to each other. A cast of fantastic and familiar fairy-tale figures includes the foolish fairy who bestows gifts nobody wants, a wise fairy godmother who refuses to use magic for anything important, and a gnome toddler with a baby beard. Author Gail Carson Levine casts a spell and manages to remake a classic tale into something completely new.","Parents need to know that highly imaginative twists on an old tale and a fast pace will keep readers turning the page.

I Never Promised You a Rose Garden,Classic story of teen schizophrenic still engages.,"When Deborah's parents take the 16-year-old to a mental institution after she tries to commit suicide, they expect it will be for a short while. Instead, Deborah spends three years there, often on the violent ""D"" ward. Based on the author's true experience in the early 1950s, this fictionalized memoir introduces readers to the hospital's own unique culture and inhabitants. As she works with a therapist to manage schizophrenia, Deborah must release her fantasy world of Yr -- where she speaks a foreign language and follows imposed rules -- and decide to join the uncertain reality of real life.
","Deborah's gradual steps may sometimes frustrate an impatient reader, but they always seem true to life. The power of this book comes about halfway through, when readers are so engrossed in Deborah and the other patients' thinking that even diagnosed ""craziness"" starts to seem, if not logical, then at least reasonable. As with any contained society, the patients relate by unspoken rules and codes; it is an often fascinating and disturbing look at a mostly hidden culture.
Readers accustomed to the tell-all nature of talk shows and first-person memoirs may keep reading for that horrific twist, the forbidden secret as to why Deborah is mentally ill. They won't find it. This story is a testament to the slow, hard work of building trust and connection between patient and therapist, reality and fantasy.","Parents need to know that I Never Promised You a Rose Garden, first published in 1964, is a fictionalized memoir of a teen girl's experiences in a mental hospital in the early 1950s. It can be intense and disturbing as it describes her fantasy world, throwing the reader into her distorted version of reality. Patients can be violent, abusive, and full of self-loathing. The main character was bullied as a child for being Jewish; there are several harsh examples of anti-Semitism. Note, however, that unlike some recent memoirs, readers will not find graphic descriptions of a horrific childhood here.

"The Quest Begins: Seekers, Book 1",Slow start to series about talking bears on quest.,"A polar bear cub in an era of disappearing ice loses her mother to orca whales. A grizzly cub's mother abandons him after his sickly brother dies. And a black bear cub, who lives in a zoo, escapes to find the grizzly after meeting his captured mother. All three must learn to survive in the wild on their own, and all three are drawn by the North Star toward a mysterious fate. Includes maps of the bears' journeys.
","Erin Hunter, the pseudonym for a group of writers who created the various Warriors fantasy series about feral cats, takes her time getting this new series about bears started. By the end not all of the characters have even met, the quest referred to in the title is undefined, the fantasy element only starts to come out, and a real plot has not yet emerged, though it is hinted at. What you get instead is a vivid and realistic portrayal of the lives of different types of bears in a time of global warming, shrinking habitat, and human intrusion, from the points of view of bear cubs who think and communicate with each other like humans, even as they act like bears.
The chapters rotate among the three main characters as their stories gradually begin to converge. Though there's much wandering and only hints of the story to come, readers will be gripped by the fascinating and often cruel lives of the bears, and by the vivid settings. A cliffhanger ending, along with the mysterious hints about what is to come will leave young readers hungry for more. Warriors fans looking for more of the same will be disappointed, but animal lovers will find this story's mix of anthropomorphism and realism appealing, and Hunter may find an entirely new audience.","Parents need to know that the world of the bears is a cruel and sometimes bloody one, in which bears fight with each other and are shot by humans.

Bone Gap,"Beautiful tale of missing girl explores magic, love, loss.","On the surface, the town of Bone Gap, Illinois, doesn't seem to be all that different from other Midwestern towns, with its crops, livestock, and assortment of oddball citizens. But there are mysterious happenings and gateways in Bone Gap, some of which citizens might know about and some they can merely sense. One day, a beautiful girl with a mysterious past shows up injured and shaken in the barn of the O'Sullivan boys, Sean and Finn. They let the girl, Roza, stay in the in-law apartment in their house. Over the course of a year, she becomes a beloved member of their household and the community. One day Roza disappears, and Finn believes he saw her get kidnapped. No one in town will believe him. The town's reaction speaks volumes about their past losses and disappointments. Finn and Sean, for instance, were abandoned by their mother and left to fend for themselves. What if Roza is just another person they trusted who walked out on them? Even so, Finn refuses to believe she left on her own. His journey to solve her disappearance includes romance with a beekeeper, suffering at the hands of bullies, fights with his brother, and a gorgeous, seemingly magical horse that shows up in his barn one night.
","This beautifully written tale blends adventure, character study, and a touch of magical realism. All the characters in BONE GAP, including the minor ones, are well drawn and interesting. Author Laura Ruby does an excellent job of creating unusual individuals who feel like real people, and their lives and pasts strike a strong emotional chord. The book is slow to develop but not necessarily in a bad way. Ruby takes her time with the characters and the various romantic and adventurous story lines, and the narrative switches between Finn's and Roza's points of view. Because the action doesn't kick into gear until about halfway through the book, Bone Gap might not appeal to younger or less patient readers. The book's overarching themes are love and loss: What is the difference between real love and obsession or between love and possession? When someone leaves you, is there something wrong with you or with the other person? The examination of the different ways people cope with all kinds of love and abandonment -- including romance, family, and friendship -- is the best part of Bone Gap.
The story's magical realism elements draw on Greek mythology, and even though the fantasy elements are interesting, they could have been more integrated into the main story. These scenes felt too far apart from the rest of the ""real"" world in the book, and the story would have benefited from more information on how or why Bone Gap is an entryway to that mystical world and more explanation of the nameless bad guy's motives and who he is. He clearly is a metaphor for all the wrong ways to love a person, but more on how he came to be obsessed and how he has the powers he does would have helped the story enormously. The book examines the way we internalize our own problems and disappointments, and the biggest message is that love can take many forms.","Parents need to know that Laura Ruby's Bone Gap is about a missing girl named Roza and the aftermath of her disappearance. Finn O'Sullivan knows she was kidnapped but can't prove it nd beings to doubt himself. His brother, Sean, who was in love with Roza, thinks perhaps she's left him, given that he's been left before. The book examines love, loss, abandonment, and family duty against the backdrop of a small Illinois farming town that's a gateway to a mysterious world. The sex, drinking, and drug use in the book is not explicit. Infrequent profanity includes ""s--t"" and ""f--k"" and it's variations. The characters face many violent situations, including stabbing, beatings, a face slashing, and an implied rape. Bone Gap won the 2016 Michael J.

"Return to the Isle of the Lost: Descendants, Book 2",Fun villain-kids romp packed with positive messages.,"Following the events of Book 1, the villain kids -- Mal, daughter of Maleficent; Carlos, son of Cruella; Jay, son of Jafar; and Evie, daughter of Evil Queen -- have escaped the Isle of the Lost (where all the Disney villains are imprisoned) and are enjoying their unfamiliar roles as heroes. Thanks to newly crowned King Ben, son of Belle and Beast and boyfriend of Mal, they're living in the kingdom of Auradon and enjoying normal teen life at Auradon Prep, with sports, dances, fashion, and lots of friends (all of them the children of Disney cartoon characters). But trouble looms: Earthquakes rattle the land, strange weather wreaks havoc, and people in the countryside report sightings of a purple dragon. Or was it a snake? The kids suspect their supposedly imprisoned evil parents have something to do with the mayhem, and after each of them gets a mysterious message, they decide they'd better RETURN TO THE ISLE OF THE LOST to investigate.
","The Descendants series' premise -- Disney villains' kids discovering they like being heroes -- is brilliant, and this cartoonish visit with its now-beloved characters is harmless, positive fun. Characters are in their teens, but their concerns and interactions reflect those of much younger kids, and there's nothing age-inappropriate for the tween crowd. It's an entertaining, if millimeter-deep vehicle for a lot of positive messages about friendship, loyalty, kindness, doing the right thing, being considerate of others, and being true to yourself. Author Melissa de la Cruz also loads the text with big words likely to improve younger readers' vocabularies. This installment is also almost hilariously marketing-driven. In addition to the lead characters, someone from Disney cartoons nd references to events on their plot threads appear on practically every page. If your kid somehow missed one of these stories, expect to hear about it.","Parents need to know that Melissa de la Cruz's Return to the Isle of the Lost, follow-up to Isle of the Lost, is the latest installment in Disney's relentlessly promoted, multiplatform (books! Movies! Apps! Games! Etc.!) Descendants franchise. It's lightweight and cartoonish and should probably be seen as another chance to spend a moment with well-loved characters rather than a stand-alone story. While the lead characters are in their teens, they're meant to appeal to a much younger audience, and this episode in what promises to be a long-running series allows each of them moments in the spotlight and bits of character development. Aside from nonstop promotion of Disney character -- nearly every one to come out of the Magic Kingdom makes at least a cameo appearance -- there's not much to worry about here. Even the brief violence, including a scene in which a character is thrown to the crocodiles and quickly rescued -- is cartoonish, and despite many threats of evil taking over the world, nothing really bad happens. Along the way there are lots of positive messages about friendship, loyalty, bravery, finding yourself -- and not letting bad circumstances, like, say, being the child of an arch-villain, define you.

The Invasion of the Boy Snatchers: A Clique Novel,"Mean, label-loving girls are awful role models.","In this fourth installment in the Clique series, Alicia's Spanish cousin transfers for a semester to their private girls' school. The 13-year-old appears to win over the boys instantly with her sexy clothes and talk. Massie schemes to get control -- of the guys and of her clique, too.
","Not only does this book have negative messages, but it isn't even well-written, limiting its appeal even as a guilty pleasure. The author occasionally captures middle school behavior well: Even these sophisticated girls worry about first kisses, send each other constant text messages, and tell lame jokes. One of the popular boys is even known for dropping his pants and doing his ""famous butt-wiggle."" But these moments are wedged between extravagant parties, mean talk, and elaborate revenge plots.
Targeting a book mostly about clothes, boys, popularity, and power to tween girls just seems wrong, especially because there are no real lessons learned.","Parents need to know that this book features lots of labels, including constant references to high-end fashion, singers, technology, and even junk food. Even though the main characters are only 12, the book glamorizes style, romance, and popularity. The Pretty Committee is definitely not about girl power: One character has a weight obsession, and the friends don't seem that concerned when one of the members has a fever-induced hallucination.

Beowulf,Ancient Saxon saga in graphic novel form. Good but gory.,"The Danish king, Hrothgar, builds a great feasting hall called Heorot. But soon it's attacked by Grendel, a monster from a nearby swamp, who kills anyone he finds within at night. Many heroes try to fight him, and give their lives in the struggle. Over the sea comes Beowulf. Having heard of the monster, he's eager to test himself. After a great battle, Beowulf defeats Grendel, tearing the monster's arm off in the process. But Grendel's troll mother, more terrible even than Grendel, swears revenge. To fight her, Beowulf must follow her to an underwater cave.
","BEOWULF is a grim and gruesome story, and artist Gareth Hinds has produced a graphic novel to match. He does a fine job with the text, adapted from A. J. Church's translation, and his draftsmanship is exemplary. But while Hinds draws the gore with crystal clarity, he's less clear about the sequence of events. There are pages, usually fight scenes with no text, where it's difficult, if not impossible, for the reader to tell exactly what is happening, and in what order. The frames are not sequential, and the action is sometimes muddy.
It's a frustrating flaw in this otherwise spectacular graphic novel version of a classic story. A visceral yet accessible treatment, this is clearly meant to appeal to video game-loving teens and fans of the November 2007 Beowulf movie starring Angelina Jolie and Anthony Hopkins.","Parents need to know that this is a graphic novel treatment of this classic tale Beowulf and may appeal to video game-loving teens and fans of the 2007 movie adaptation.

\ Eight-year-old Jack and seven-year-old Annie are set for their third adventure when they find a book on pyramids in the magic treehouse. They soon land in the desert of Ancient Egypt, where they witness an Egyptian funeral procession carrying a sarcophagus on its way to a pyramid.
Then it disappears, and Jack and Annie follow a mysterious black cat to the burial chamber.

The two adventurers follow hieroglyphic clues of stairs, boat, jug, and folded cloth to uncover the Book of the Dead and return it to Queen Hutepi.

Big Bear Little Chair,"Kids easily grasp opposites through bold, stylized art.","BIG BEAR little chair is a collection of opposites, of big things compared with little things. There's a thin thread of a story with recurring bear characters Big Bear and little bear. Big Bear is first paired with a little chair (he doesn't fit!), and little bear tries to climb onto Big Chair (too high!). Spoiler alert: At the end, they find their just-right chairs. Most of the pairings stand alone. Some are realistic and natural, such as little fish/Big Sea, and others, such as Big Zebra/little broom and Big Lion/little wagon, have a silly quality kids will enjoy.

","This New York Times Best Illustrated book is ideal for teaching young kids the concepts of big and little -- nd just for having fun, too. Each page pairs something big with something little, and the juxtapositions are sometimes moodily cosmic (Big Moon/little star) and sometimes happily silly (little umbrella/Big Bird). Because there's very little text, kids can chime in and ""read along"" from the start.

This concept book introduces young kids to size by juxtaposing things that are big and little, with each page pairing and comparing things of different size -- for instance little butterfly/Big Rock and Big Moon/little star. With very little text, the fun is in the pictures.

House of Secrets,Page-turner is the perfect campfire tale but can get gory.,"The day Cordelia, Brendan, and Eleanor Walker visit Kristoff House with their parents, they know there has to be something wrong with it. Could it be the fishy price? No way a mansion on the Pacific could cost so little. Or could it be the creepy one-handed, bald witch that threatens Brendan in the backyard? Hmm ... On move-in day it's all movie night fun and pizza until the witch shows up and throws down a curse. And faster than you can say Wizard of Oz, the house lands in another world, which is a mashup of fantasy novels written by the home's namesake, Denver Kristoff. The witch will keep the Walkers there until they bring her The Book of Doom and Desire, an occult tome that will appear only to the sibling who does something impulsive and selfish. As the Walkers decide that they won't help the witch get what she wants, they're tested. They think having no cell phone reception and flushing toilets is bad -- until the mercenaries arrive. And the colossus. And the pirates. And sword-wielding skeletons ...
","Co-author Chris Columbus has an eye for a mainstream hit. Say it together now: ""Goonies never say die!"" It's as if for HOUSE OF SECRETS, he found a Top 10 list of what gives kids the willies, threw everything in a blender, then folded in three bickering sibs with lots of heart. There's an evil fantasy world with no escape, a witch with a curse, occult rituals, pirates, mercenaries, giants, sharks, fighting skeletons, secret passageways, and things coming back from the dead. Check, check, check. There's something to spook every tween on the next camping trip.
	With a s'more in hand is probably the best way to enjoy House of Secrets. Readers pondering the story too long will have some questions about the slapped-together fantasy elements (why does the attic have that special power?) and may even wonder why the Walker family gets cursed in the first place. (Great-Great-Grandpa Walker never had the evil book.) Seems as if Columbus is after his next big kid entertainment, not high fantasy, and he's got it right here.","Parents need to know that House of Secrets is co-written by Chris Columbus -- who directed the first two Harry Potter movies (J. K. Rowling gives it a plug on the front cover) and wrote scripts for the The Goonies and Gremlins -- and YA author Ned Vizzini (The Other Normals).  With lots of action-violence featuring kids battling pirates, mercenaries, cursed skeletons, and supernatural forces, it feels a bit like Gremlins and The Goonies. But House of Secrets can get gory, too, with talk of live autopsies performed by the pirate captain, a couple of fatal stabbings, kids removing an arrow and stitching up the wound themselves, and an eyeball pierced by an arrow and then plucked out intact. The three Walker siblings at the center of the story are threatened by death constantly, and their loyalty to one another is tested; luckily, they always come together in a crisis. Also expect some mild swearing (""bloody,"" ""damn,"" ""bugger off,""  and ""hell"" used sparingly), a couple of crushes, and some product placement, including the PSP game Red Dead Redemption that Brendan is always playing (and that Common Sense Media does not recommend for kids).

Gone Wild: An Endangered Animal Alphabet,"Caldecott Honor is about the art, not the ABCs.","Through art and bios, this alphabet book highlights 26 animals on the brink of extinction. Bold, single-letter illustrations are juxtaposed with animal characteristics such as ears, snouts, beaks, and hooves. Basic stats on each animal explain why it's endangered.
","Just going on its illustrations, GONE WILD is an inventive gem. Animal characteristics creep and crawl out of big block letters: The floppy ears, snouts, long necks, and wild eyes belong to endangered animals starting with every letter of the alphabet. But sit down with this book with any kid learning their ABCs, and you'll end up having to explain why some animals have dwindling habitats or are overfished or hunted to near-extinction.
Another minus is that many of the featured animals are rare and unfamiliar. While older kids may find the odd ducks and insects novel, younger ones probably would prefer critters they're used to -- and illustrations that feature cuddly faces. It's not surprising that this is the author's first children's book. This could be a good choice for tweens who love art class or are involved in their school's environmental activities.","Parents need to know that this Caldecott Honor alphabet book isn't meant for kids just learning their ABCs. Each letter incorporates elements of a specific endangered animal. The animal facts section is interesting but upsetting; it cites many reasons these animals are losing their habitats and their lives. The resources section points kids to ways to help save animals and habitats, but it's only a small part of the book.

Another,Girl meets her match in mind-bending upside-down world.,"A little girl with brown skin and black braids goes to bed and is awakened when a hole opens up in her room and a cat who looks just like her cat (except that cat's collar is blue and her cat's collar is red) comes through the hole and grabs her cat's toy mouse, and her cat follows after them through the hole. The girl follows her cat and pops through that portal upside down. She eventually finds ANOTHER girl who looks just like her (except that girl has a blue Saturn on her dress instead of a red one). She also sees a bunch of diverse kids playing, but it seems every kid has a double -- different only in clothes or accessories of a different color (such as red vs. blue glasses or a black vs. white head scarf). Eventually the girl in the upside-down world tosses the girl from our world the toy mouse, and the girl and her cat return home through the portal, back into their bedroom, and go to sleep. The portal has closed and the nocturnal adventure appears to be over -- but readers will notice there's now a blue toy mouse in the room ... from the other world. ","This unusual, mind-bending wordless story takes readers to a fun opposite world where up is down and down is up and everything's the same but slightly different. Another challenges readers to explore another dimension and kids playing with alternative versions of themselves -- like except for tiny variations in what they're wearing or holding (like a blue vs. yellow book or red vs. blue leash), or how they're positioned (like upside down vs. right side up). Young readers will have fun figuring out who matches whom and what's different and the same about the pairs of kids. Is it a dream? A parallel universe? Another planet? Is it an ideal world where everyone plays together happily? Kids can decide for themselves as they turn the book over and over to see which end is up. Author Christian Robinson's playful mixed-media and paper collage art is set against stark white pages in the alternative world and pitch black walls in the bedroom world. The kids are expressive and appealing, and invite readers to make up their own stories about what those kids are up to.  ","Parents need to know that Another, by Caldecott Honor artist Christian Robinson, is a brain-twisting wordless adventure that follows a little girl and her cat through a portal to another dimension that's almost a mirror image of their own.

"Princess in Disguise: A Tale of the Wide-Awake Princess, Book 4","Fewer thrills, more relationship focus in this installment.","In PRINCESS IN DISGUISE: A TALE OF THE WIDE-AWAKE PRINCESS, Annie and Liam are excited to finally be married -- until everything about their special day takes a turn for the worse, from sudden flooding at the castle to a surge of rats to rashes befalling Snow White and Cinderella. Instead of spending a day enjoying perfect wedded bliss, Annie and Liam must figure out whom they've angered and what they can do about it. But to do so, they'll have to find disguises and hit the road for one last adventure before they wed.
","This installment in the series isn't as suspenseful as the previous books, but it upholds the series tradition of giving Annie room to be resourceful, smart, headstrong, and compassionate. It also provides a deeper exploration of her relationship with Liam nd shows what  mutually respectful relationship of equals looks like.
The plot's twists and turns are less thrilling than in earlier books, and the focus here is more on Annie and Liam's relationship than on Annie's individual problem-solving. But the team works together to solve problems and establish themselves as benevolent, kind royals, with the focus on their compassion as a couple.","Parents need to know that Princess in Disguise: A Tale of the Wide-Awake Princess is the fourth book in the Wide-Awake series from E.D. Baker. Here, the series continues to reimagine princesses as courageous, compassionate, ethical heroines whose looks are the least important thing about them. Instead, they work to be inclusive, fair, kind royals who consider others, take great risks to protect those they care about, and do whatever it takes to set things right. Though the plot points still mimic those of traditional fairy tales and the gender roles necessitated by them -- here Annie and Liam are in the midst of planning a wedding -- the book strives to emphasize character over superficial concerns at every turn and challenges readers to question their assumptions about what girls and boys can or should do.

Show Way,"Beautiful story, from slavery to freedom.","The author touches on the lives of each of her female ancestors on her mother's side of the family, covering nine generations up to her daughter. She begins with a little unnamed girl sold away from her family at a young age, who learns to sew quilts that show the road to freedom, called Show Ways. Her daughter, Mathis May, is also sold away, and also learns to sew the Show Ways.
When freedom comes, the daughters in the family continue to learn how to sew beautiful quilts, which they sell to earn a living. Eventually some of them learn to read, become teachers, participate in the Civil Rights Movement, and on down to the author, who becomes a writer who still sews quilts, and has a daughter, to whom she tells the stories of her family.
","The rich and complex, two-page, borderless pictures reward repeated viewings and close inspection. This story bout nine generations of African-American women won the Newbery Honor, but with its spectacular art by Hudson Talbott it seems a more likely choice for the Caldecott, which celebrates art. Some of the pictures are beautiful watercolor paintings, some are historical collages, and some are visual metaphors, such as one showing a map of the U.S. with the states crudely sewn together and a large, frayed rip along the Mason-Dixon
The text is beautifully written, with recurring motifs about mother love and roads of stars, quilts, and stories. But there are many references that younger children may not understand. Twice characters are said to have ""jumped broom,"" with no explanation. The author refers to ""the north side of the war,"" but what war, and what that means, is not explained. This book is probably best shared with an adult.","Parents need to know that though this is a picture book, it's aimed at middle grade kids.

You're ready to reign!"" The narrator's royal spin on the experience continues throughout the day as the boy takes ""a big yellow carriage"" (the schoolbus) to school and grabs  ""royal seat at your round table,"" learns the classroom rules, plays a game of fighting a fire-breathing dragon at recess, has ""a royal rest,"" and gets a sendoff from his teacher, who will ""wish you all a magnificent evening and bid you farewell until dawn.""
","This enthusiastic, uplifitng story of a boy's first day of kindergarten layers on the kingly language to make it fresh and boost confidence.

"A Pack Divided: Survivors, The Gathering Darkness, Book 1",Exciting post-disaster dog fantasy best for fans of series.,"Storm, a young Fierce Dog taken in as an orphan pup by Sweet and Lucky's pack, saved them in an earlier book by killing an enemy. Now, she faces a lot of day-to-day challenges. Many of her pack mates don't trust her because she's a Fierce Dog, and it doesn't make things better that another dog is a clingy, adoring fan. As this new series gets underway, Storm struggles to do the right thing and fit in, but a set of strange incidents, from an innocent dog being framed to the unexplained killing of puppies, has everyone on edge, as Sweet and Lucky, expecting their own puppies, struggle to maintain harmony in A PACK DIVIDED.
","Fans of Erin Hunter's first Survivors series will lap up this tale of a young dog's coming-of-age struggles as her pack confronts danger in a post-disaster world. There are plenty of positive messages about duty, belonging, and the challenges of leadership in this first installment of the Gathering Darkness series. The tale keeps the pages turning with exciting scenes of hunting and peril, plus relatable situations, such as being afraid, confused, or misunderstood -- and finding wisdom and comfort from friends.
Those new to the series might want to read the original six Survivors books first, because the characters, relationships, and cosmology (involving formerly domestic dogs fending for themselves in the wake of a catastrophic earthquake, as well as canine myths about Sun Dog, Earth Dog, Fear Dog, and the like) might be a bit overwhelming. Never fear, because the relentlessly productive ""Erin Hunter"" (actually a six-woman syndicate of five writers and an editor) includes a whopping 12 pages at the back of the book promoting her complete works, catalog-style, which besides Survivors include Warriors (about cats) and Seekers (about bears).","Parents need to know that Erin Hunter's A Pack Divided launches a Survivors series called the Gathering Darkness. Focused on adolescent ""fierce dog"" Storm and her struggle to find her place in the pack (which includes many dogs from the earlier series), the story offers many positive messages about integrity, belonging, obeying authority for the good of everyone, and finding your own path. There's some violence, as the dogs hunt prey to survive; Storm herself has killed an enemy in battle, nd an unknown dog is killing puppies; and humans have killed dogs in other books nd remain a scary presence. Dog-loving kids will lap up the adventures and empathize with Storm, though some will find it sad that the dogs are forced to fend for themselves because they've lost the humans who loved them. Kids who've read the six books in the first Survivors series and are familiar with the characters, setting, and relationships will have an easier time plunging into this one.

"It Ain't So Awful, Falafel",Relatable story of Iranian girl in U.S. who wants to fit in.,"When her family moves to Newport Beach, California, right before she starts sixth grade, Zomorod is so desperate to fit in that she changes her name to Cindy. She's embarrassed by her Iranian family: Her depressed mother won't learn English and doesn't grasp American social etiquette, her engineer dad talks only about oil in thickly accented English, and her family doesn't celebrate American holidays. After a rocky start, Cindy has great friends and feels she's blending in (though she's often mistaken for Mexican). But the Iranian Revolution and hostage crisis threaten everything in their lives, and the family faces threats. Cindy no longer feels welcome in America -- but could she return to such a changed Iran?
","The 1979 revolution in Iran may seem like ancient history to middle schoolers today, but this amiable novel makes that tense, world-changing event real and -- most importantly -- relatable. Author Firoozeh Dumas draws on her own childhood for IT AIN'T SO AWFUL, FALAFEL, and she captures the spirit and voice of a young girl whose normal middle school anxieties are deepened by a sometimes unbridgeable gulf between her nd her very American peers.
Cindy and her family are the emotional core of the story: Cindy's friends, though kind and steadfast, are barely developed. Her girlfriends and kindly neighbors are primarily used to prop up dialogue explaining developments in Iran. Dumas clearly describes the cultural and political changes in Iran and the nation's complicated history with the U.S., and she affectingly portrays the countless ways newcomers to America can struggle to feel at home. It raises issues about the immigrant experience that still resonate today.","Parents need to know that It Ain't So Awful, Falafel is about an immigrant family from Iran that faces both kindness and cruel harassment amid the drama of the Iran hostage crisis that began in 1979. Author Firoozeh Dumas (Funny in Farsi) draws on her experience growing up in California during that time, outlining some of the pivotal moments of the Iranian revolution and the rise of Ayatollah Khomeini and describing how it all affected American politics and culture. She describes some of the violence in Iran, poignantly showing how distressing it was for people living in the United States who were worried about friends and family back in Iran. Not only are the bullies outnumbered by upstanders in this story, but characters who engage in mean or petty behavior are presented with some complexity and insight.

"We Hunt the Flame: Sands of Arawiya, Book 1","Intriguing, sometimes confusing fantasy with Arabian flare.","In WE HUNT THE FLAME, Zafira is the only one in her starving village who can hunt in the Arz, a cursed forest that swallows up more land every day. She helps feed her people in secret, pretending to be a man, because being a woman with power is considered bad luck ever since six ruling sisters mysteriously disappeared with all the world's magic 90 years before. When a silver witch appears with a quest to look for the lost magic, Zafira can't pass up the chance. The quest will take her far beyond the Arz, across the Baransea, and to the Sharr, an island that imprisoned dark magic in the time of the six sisters. No one expects her to come back alive, least of all the Sultan to the north, who sends his son Nasir, a trained assassin, to find the famed hunter and bring the lost magic to him.
","There are so many cool flourishes to this debut author's ancient Arabia-inspired fantasy world that you can forgive the parts of the story that confuse or could use more polish. Magical elements, immortal beings, places, and the folklore of the Arawiya aren't always presented clearly for the reader -- you'll consult the map at the front of the book to center yourself far more than you normally would -- but this world will still draw you in. So will the main characters, Zafira and Nasir. When it's clear they'll be on the same quest, you'll be anxious for them to meet and for the arrows and knives -- and, eventually, sparks -- to fly.
The island and the forest can think and feel, which is cool-- they're possibly malevolent, but not entirely. The chilling landscape draws both the main characters in for very different reasons and all its shadowy features add to the tension. So do the shapeshifting ifrit that dredge up the characters' struggles with loss and longing. The climactic action will confuse readers again with some last-minute realizations about what they're looking for and how to acquire it, but the setup for the sequel is exactly what's needed to tease up a new fan base.","Parents need to know that We Hunt the Flame is the start of a fantasy-romance series by first-time author and Muslim American woman Hafsah Faizal. It takes place in a fictitious land, but incorporates some fantasy elements from the ancient Arabian tradition -- like the shape-shifting, evil ifrits. You'll also learn a little Arabic. The main characters -- one, a huntress named Zafira and the other, a trained assassin and prince named Nasir -- head for a cursed island where they meet lots of ifrits and worse. There are many fights with arrows, knives, and scimitars with the death of two people close to the main characters and throats slit. There's a scene of torture with a hot poker with talk of a character enduring a childhood of the same thing. There are also repeated mentions of a tongue cut out, of a mother's death, a father's madness that led to his family killing him in self-defense, and talk of a village burned down and many dying from chemical weapons. Other mature content involves a brief bout of passionate kissing and innuendo. Zafira grows from someone who hides who she is to someone who embraces her power and her identity. Nasir begins to open his heart and see himself as something other than a monster.

Rodzina,Plucky orphans struggle in the rugged West in harsh tale.,"Rodzina, the eponymous heroine of Karen Cushman's historical novel, is a big, angry, chunky, homely Polish-American orphan. Though 12, she looks 15, and is sure no one could possibly want to adopt her except to exploit her as a virtual slave. Forced onto one of the Orphan Trains, which took orphans from the cities in the East to find homes in the frontier lands of th West in the 19th and early 20th centuries, it seems she may be right -- the only people interested in her are looking for hard workers, not daughters. The adult caretakers on this expedition, Mr. Szprot and the woman Rodzina calls Miss Doctor, come from the Mr. Bumble school of orphan care -- they are mean and seemingly heartless, though there may be more to Miss Doctor than meets the eye. But if they won't look after her best interests, Rodzina is determined to do it herself, even if it means she never finds a home.
","Rodzina is no winsome and appealing little Oliver Twist -- she's tough and strong and, as the narrator of her own tale, far more engaging to readers than she is to the other characters in the story. But the world she describes is somewhat Dickensian, filled with filth, squalor, and a lot of mean adults who don't like children.
Two-time Newbery winner Karen Cushman writes an enjoyable story, but this is not her best work. She softens the story for her audience, and experienced young readers will see the too-pat ending coming a long way off. In the meantime, though, this tale of plucky orphans making their way in a rugged and unfeeling world is entertaining enough, and Rodzina is an unusual heroine.","Parents need to know that Newbery-winning author Karen Cushman's Rodzina depicts the difficult and bleak life of orphans sent on Orphan Trains to live with settlers in the West during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Department 19,Suspenseful vampire horror really goes for the gore.,"Two years after Jamie Carpenter sees his father shoot himself as the authorities close in, his mother is kidnapped and Jamie is picked up by Department 19. The super-secret organization informs him that his mother is being held by a vampire -- the oldest and most sadistic one. They also tell him that his father worked for Department 19. In fact, the Carpenters were one of the founding families of the organization, guaranteeing Jamie a place there. Hoping to save his mother, he quickly trains and suits up in some pretty impressive vampire-hunter gear. But the vampire is always three steps ahead of him, even with the monster Frankenstein and an attractive teen vampire helping Jamie track him down.
","Horror fans are really in for a treat. Even those who think they've read too many vampire books in the last few years will enjoy visiting the undead in DEPARTMENT 19. It's got plenty of gore, but it's also smart with good twists that will keep teens guessing. The author adds depth by flashing back to classic characters from the genre, like the original vampire hunters who took down Count Dracula. Frankenstein's monster is also a character, which could have been hokey (see Young Frankenstein for proof), but instead readers will find him complex, funny, terribly loyal, and a born vampire hunter. Jamie's montage-like vampire hunter training session seems familiar (see The Matrix), but it's easily forgivable. In the end, readers will quickly drain Department 19 and be thirsty for more. This is going to be a riveting series. ","Parents need to know that this gory book is the first of a planned series about a vampire-hunting organization. It starts with the memory a teen has of his father shooting himself as authorities close in on him and continues as a sadistic vampire kidnaps his mother and sends a message etched on a torso saying ""tell the boy to come."" Vampires kill mercilessly and sometimes ritualistically -- corpses are dismembered, victims bleed upside down in a circle -- and vampire hunters carry all kinds of weapons an M-rated video game would relish, like a stake in a hand-held cannon. Other mature content includes smoking and drinking by mortals and immortals getting high on a meth-and-blood mix called Bliss. Readers paying attention to the less bloody details will notice references to classic literature such as Bram Stoker's Dracula and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. They will also notice that the main character, Jamie is quite a hot-head. He's always angry and yelling about something. But he seems to have a good mentor and is grounded by his search for his kidnapped mother.

"King's Cage: Red Queen, Book 3",Author returns to form with nail-biting third installment.,"KING'S CAGE is Victoria Aveyard's third book in the best-selling Red Queen series following Red-born Mare Barrow, who has even greater powers than those born with Silver blood, and the king's cage is the symbol of a revolution to overthrow the oppressive Silver rulers. Starting shortly after Glass Sword ends, Mare is in King Maven's custody, having exchanged her freedom for the safety of Silver-blooded Prince Cal, the Scarlet Guard, and the Newbloods she had rounded up to fight Maven. Back at the palace, Maven has Mare interrogated by his Silver cousin who can manipulate and search her mind -- but he also dolls her up to show off like a pretty puppet. Maven forces her to make statements renouncing the Scarlet Guard and asking Newbloods to come out of hiding and serve the new King. Meanwhile, Cal, Farley, Kilorn, and Cameron try to simultaneously plan the resistance without Mare and find a way to save her from Maven.
","After Aveyard's disappointing second book, this installment is just what Red Queen fans need: genuine growth and character development, more romance, and more end game in sight for Mare Barrow. Even skeptics who put the series down after the lackluster Glass Sword should consider resuming it now that the author has once again found her groove, and her main character is no longer as excruciating to follow. Although the bulk of the book has Mare imprisoned in the Silver Palace, it's not just ll about her. Aveyard manages to couple Mare's self-reflection with glimpses of villains who are far more complex than they originally seemed. Maven was twisted and molded by his now-dead mother, whose powers allowed her to take away and insert thoughts and feelings at her will. Evangeline is revealed to be far more ambitious (and far less interested in being any man's Queen) and even slightly in awe of Mare. And then there's Cal, who still struggles with Hamlet levels of indecision with the one exception of his overpowering feelings for Mare.
At more than 500 pages, it's unsurprising that the pacing is uneven: Some parts fly by, and others feel overlong. The introduction of Newblood Cameron as a narrator has potential, but so far it hasn't been seamless; her chapters are noticeably less compelling than the other points of view. She is, however, an interesting counterpoint to Mare, and she injects some diversity (beyond the blood colors) to the story. The women in this installment (Mare, Cameron, Farley, Evangeline, and even a brief cameo by Cal's grandmother, who's reminiscent of the clever but elderly matriarch Olenna Tyrell from Game of Thrones) outshine the men. Given that the book starts with a quote from Hillary Rodham Clinton, that's clearly on purpose, and discerning readers can see how girls will eventually rule in this world.","Parents need to know that King's Cage is the third installment in Victoria Aveyard's best-selling Red Queen fantasy series. Fans of the fantasy series will know to expect scenes of supernatural and traditional combat violence (the Silvers and Newbloods all possess special powers, while the Reds use weapons), which include battle sequences where some characters control weather, others electricity, and others fire, and some simply use guns, swords, and more. There's a great deal of personal violence in this book, but the action violence is contained mostly in the last quarter of the story. The romance ramps up in this sequel, with one love story resulting in a sexual relationship, but the author keeps the passages teen-reader-appropriate.

"A Girl Undone:  A Girl Called Fearless, Book 2","Angsty, suspenseful sequel is less socially conscious.","Avie is still on the run from the Paternalist government. She has evidence of the new political party's wrongdoings, including selling nuclear weapons to a foreign government. She heads to Canada so she can find a way to expose the Paternalists from a safe place. Eventually she's recaptured by Retrievers, thugs hired by her fiancé, who take her back to her life as a trophy and virtual prisoner of the Paternalist candidate for governor. She'll have to decide whether she can live with her decision to save herself or whether she can sacrifice herself to bring an end to the Paternalist's stranglehold on women's lives and personal freedom.
","Catherine Linka's follow-up to A Girl Called Fearless is suspenseful and compelling but less meaty than its predecessor. It doesn't explore important social issues as it follows Avie's inner journey to making the right decisions, which gives it a more angsty, hand-wringing feel. Readers who haven't read the first book may feel lost, as some of the recapping of what came before is convoluted and confusing. Details about women's lives under the authoritarian government are rediscovered late in the novel, and, until they are, readers may find themselves wondering what the big deal is. The plotting is not as well structured, with some events seemingly happening at arbitrary moments.
But Avie is still a compelling, strong, believable hero, and teens who enjoyed the first book will enjoy rooting for A GIRL UNDONE s she struggles with choosing between saving herself and trying to help others. ","Parents need to know that A Girl Undone picks up where A Girl Called Fearless left off, and teens who haven't read the first volume may not find it compelling. There's less food for thought as the focus shifts to the choices Avie makes and how they affect her. Strong language includes infrequent use of ""f--k,"" with dashes, but it's spelled out once or twice; also infrequent are ""crap"" and ""s--t"" (spelled out). Violence is infrequent, but there is a murder-suicide with brief descriptions of the bloody aftermath. Older teens exchange a few kisses. An illegal pharmaceutical trade is mentioned, as is a suicide attempt involving pills and alcohol.

","Turns out that not only is Jeff Foxworthy a fairly funny guy for adults, he also gets what makes kids laugh and he knows how to pull together a rhyme. His collection would be a fun addition to the family library even without his famous name on the cover. His mix of long and short poems makes it easy to find something to read even for kids who get antsy.
The illustrations are well suited to the story, with lots of busy kids and lots of movement. The result? A fun and funny book that might even become a family read-aloud favorite.","Parents need to know that this book of silly poems keeps its humor clean. There's nothing to be offended by here.

"Maid of Secrets: Maids of Honor, Book 1",Engrossing Elizabethan tale of murder and intrigue.,"Palace intrigue takes center stage as an orphaned pickpocket finds herself, at 17, suddenly taken from her world to be a spy for the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth I. Heroine Meg must neutralize threats of overthrow from Catholic Spain, solve the murder of a young maid of honor, find out who's responsible for mysterious disruptions at court, and cope with handsome young men who may or may not be on her side. And it all takes place in the highly restricted world of a royal court where what you see may not be what you get.
","Putting espionage and romance up against the colorful and realistic backdrop of the Elizabethan age draws MAID OF SECRETS' readers into a fascinating historical era. Seen through the eyes of a newly arrived outsider, we learn the perils of royal intrigue right along with Meg. Kids will enjoy the clever solutions that people came up with to solve problems without modern technology (like an alarm clock that uses dripping water or tying intricate knots to see whether someone's opened a package). That said, modernized language keeps the material easy to access, so don't expect spot-on historical accuracy.
Meg is an appealing, whip-smart heroine whose struggles with friendship, truth, and loyalty make her easy for kids to identify with and admire. Parents will appreciate the value she places on educating herself and how her high self esteem and creative thinking help her navigate some tough problems. Planned as the first installment in a series, this satisfying mystery is likely to have readers looking forward to many more adventures.","Parents need to know that Maid of Secrets brings the Elizabethan era to life through colorful and realistic characters, palace intrigue, budding romance, and a murder mystery. Violence is described with some detail; overall, there's not much gore, but on a few occasions blood does spurt, seep, or stain. Courtly espionage is the main focus, with the 17-year-old heroine navigating many tricky situations with pluck and great inner strength. Handsome and charismatic young men provide a framework for learning to manage physical and emotional responses to first romantic encounters (kissing, some clothed making out).

Rats Saw God,Funny high school novel reveals tender truths.,"Given an assignment to write a 100-page paper in order to graduate, eighteen-year-old Steve York retells his high school career -- from delirious fun with a group of happy misfits to a decline into bitterness and alienation, and a hopeful recovery.
In Houston, straight-A high school student Steve York's biggest problems were getting along with his famous astronaut father and asking out the girl of his dreams -- a fellow member of a group of intellectual nonconformists called the Grace Order of Dadaists (G.O.D.). In San Diego, where he has fled to live with his remarried mother after a disastrous junior year, Steve is a certified \""stoner,\"" an alienated pot-smoker and class-cutter. .
How did Steve get from there to here? Alternating between past and present, Steve narrates his high school history in the form of a writing assignment for Jeff DeMouy, a sympathetic guidance counselor willing to give Steve another chance to earn the English credit he needs in order to graduate. There unfolds a story about how high school relationships can shift and change -- sometimes irreparably, sometimes for the better.
","Part The Breakfast Club, part Animal House, this funny how-I-survived-high-school novel reveals tender truths between hilarious one-liners. On the surface, nothing that happens in Steve York's life is terribly credible, starting with the fact that his father was ""the third or fourth man to walk on the moon."" Supposedly a group of artistic, hip nonconformists, Steve's high school club, G.O.D., includes the requisite jock, the editor of the school paper, the lead in the school play, and the best-looking boy in school.
Yet the central relationships in Steve's life -- with Doug, the founder of G.O.D.; with Dub, his first love, who relieves him of his virginity and breaks his heart; and with his father, ""the astronaut"" -- all change in believable ways. Friendships mature; first love often isn't forever; and parents don't fit into tidy pigeonholes. However over the top the plot may seem, Rob Thomas' original language makes it seem real.","Parents need to know that though the book presents Steve's pot-smoking as self-destructive, it portrays his heavy underage drinking as a high school norm. The writing-assignment structure isn't very original, but the antics of the G.O.D. group and the treatment of timeless adolescent issues give this its freshness and power. But even for young teens this has some pretty raw scenes.

Winterwood,"Moody, emo tale of star-crossed teens and haunted woods.","WINTERWOOD takes place in the town of Fir Haven, on the shores of a supposedly bottomless lake in the Pacific Northwest. It's pretty lively in summer, with tourists and vacationing families. But now it's winter, and, in the wake of a storm that's closed the roads and cut off power, few people remain -- and most of them are the unwilling residents of the camp for wayward boys by the lakeside. Also by the lakeside is the home of many generations of Walker women, rumored to be witches, where 17-year-old Nora Walker is home alone, her mom stranded out of town. Word comes that a boy has disappeared from the camp during the storm, and when Nora ventures into the woods, which she has good reason to know are full of mysterious, hostile forces, she finds an unconscious boy, Oliver. She takes him home and revives him, all the while troubled by the sense that something's not right. For his part, Oliver's got the same feeling, especially since there are big gaps in his memory. The two of them are determined to find the truth about what happened in the storm and what Oliver had to do with it, even though they're pretty sure they won't like what they find out. However, staying alive may be a more pressing challenge.
","Fans of angsty, doomy Gothic romance will find much to love in this tale of haunted woods, teens behaving badly, and a star-crossed couple facing dangers supernatural and otherwise. Protagonist/narrators Nora and Oliver are appealing and relatable as they fall in love while overwhelmed with a sense of wrongness and impending doom. But some readers may find there's a lot of foreshadowing, deer-in-the-headlights paralysis, and hand-wringing en route to Winterwood's eventual, and satisfying, payoff.","Parents need to know that Winterwood, like author Shea Ernshaw's debut The Wicked Deep, is an angst-filled, ominous tale of teens in love, at the mercy of mysterious forces and struggling to find their path. Pacific Northwest Gothic creepiness abounds, including a supernatural forest, a bottomless lake, generations of witches living by its side, and a camp for wayward boys. Everyone is trapped there for weeks with no power or phone service in the wake of a storm, in which a boy has disappeared and is presumed dead. One of the characters has very likely killed him, but some have lost their memory and others aren't talking. Typically for the genre, much of the plot involves drunk, partying teens with cruel, stupid, bullying behavior, who also throw around a lot of strong language (""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""pissed,"" ""a--hole"") and trash the houses of absent owners after breaking in. Against this, the two teen narrators -- 17-year-old Nora, youngest member of the witch (or so they say) family, and Oliver, the mysterious boy she finds unconscious in the woods -- re trying to do the right thing, help each other, stay out of harm's way, and prevent catastrophe.

Girl Made of Stars,Gripping story of girl's twin brother accused of rape.,"In GIRL MADE OF STARS, twins Mara and Owen are exceptionally close, and that nearly molecular-level knowledge of each other is the thing that threatens to tear them apart. When Owen is accused of raping his girlfriend, who happens to be a close friend of Mara's, she has no idea who to believe. Her family expects her to back Owen in his insistence on his innocence, but a past trauma of Mara's and her work in her feminist club tell her to believe the victim. And because she knows the victim well, she has a hard time believing she would lie. The buried trauma from Mara's past starts bubbling up and becomes hard to ignore, and when mixed in with relationship problems with her ex-girlfriend and social issues at school, she's left feeling isolated, confused, hurt, and overwhelmed. She digs deep into scary emotional territory to find out what she is made of.
","This emotional story of family and friendship tackles lots of tough issues, including rape, consent, sexual and gender identity, and teen relationships. In Girl Made of Stars, author Ashley Herring Blake successfully shows why it is so hard for victims of sexual violence to come forward. She also highlights the ripple effect sexual assaults create on the lives of the victims and those close to them. Mara's a relatable and enjoyable narrator. It's easy to feel everything she is going through and fully understand her struggle over who to believe in the rape case: her brother or one of her closest friends. All the characters, even the minor players, have depth and range, which sometimes seems all too rare in YA novels.
Readers will get insight into what gay, bi, and nonbinary teens go through, both in their inner struggles and in dealing with the ignorance of others. And while it is admirable that Blake takes on so many issues in one book -- rape, consent, victim shaming, sexual and gender orientation, sexist dress codes, feminism, family dynamics, male privilege, bullying -- it feels like she's on overdrive, trying to cram too much into one novel. Sometimes Blake hits the reader over the head with her messages, instead of letting the story flow.","Parents need to know that Girl Made of Stars, by Ashley Herring Blake (Ivy Aberdeen's Letter to the World), is about twins Mara and Owen and how an accusation of rape against Owen takes its toll on Mara and her family. The victim of the alleged assault is one of Mara's best friends, and most of the book centers on Mara's conflicted feelings over who to believe. Mara is bisexual and her ex-girlfriend Charlie is nonbinary. Their sexual and gender identities are positively portrayed and figure into the plot. Characters drink in one scene and swear somewhat frequently, including ""s--t,"" ""f--k,"" and ""a--hole."" Consent, family dynamics, the effects of trauma, teen dating, and bullying are important aspects to the story and provide good discussion points for families.

Wolf in the Snow,Girl rescues lost wolf pup in wordless tale of compassion.,"A girl in a red hooded jacket starts walking home from school as it starts to snow, hears a wolf pack, and notices a WOLF IN THE SNOW, a pup who's fallen behind and gotten lost. She picks it up and trudges through the snowstorm to bring it to the pack. Eventually pup nd mother are reunited, but by then the girl is lost and so exhausted she collapses into  ball. The wolves surround her and howl to alert the girl's dog and parents, who've been tracking her. So she, too, is rescued nd reunited with her mom. The last scene shows the girl and her family back home, warm and safe.
","This nearly wordless book creates a captivating landscape of peril and compassion starring a kind, brave little girl undaunted by nature and the nimal world. Author-illustrator Matthew Cordell's pen-and-ink with watercolor illustrations in Wolf in the Snow draw you in and make you care about the characters, showing the changing emotions on the girl's face, sometimes with only her eyes showing between her jacket hood nd the scarf around her neck. The only words are wolf sounds: the whine of the pup and the growls and howls of wolves in the pack.

The Book That Jack Wrote,"An artistically splendid, but dark, circular tale.","Jon Scieszka and Daniel Adel take ""The House That Jack Built"" and transform it into a dark, if artistically splendid, circular tale with the surrealist's odd touch here and there. Cheeky fun for more advanced readers--lots of literary references and sophisticated sight gags here--though they might, unfortunately, feel they're beyond a nursery-rhyme remake.
 ","Never one to leave anything well enough alone, Jon Scieszka puts a tack on the chair where the nursery rhyme ""The House That Jack Built"" heretofore comfortably sat. Why, Scieszka seems to wonder, settle for singsong when a little mayhem enlivens the proceedings? But parody ought to choose its targets carefully, and this one sure feels underage.
Most fun here is unraveling the time-space reversals at work. Why is the baby humming a tune wearing a pie for a hat, and what got him so pumped as to toss the cow sailing over the moon? Daniel Adel's paintings are full of Rembrandt light and rich, rich color. The frames painted around the artwork give the impression of deep-dish pies, still hot and ready for the introduction of a fork.","Parents need to know that this parody has the classical and fun circular motif and has a dark, surreal touch.

The family arrives home to find Santa taking a nap in Baby Bear's bed. Santa apologizes for the breakage and promises to bring them a new chair next year.
","SANTA CLAUS AND THE THREE BEARS does a great job of adapting the familiar tale for the holidays.

She doesn't fit in at school, where her friends are pursuing new interests. But Abbie doesn't have a ""thing"" yet, and the pressure to choose is more than she can handle. The only thing she's looking forward to is lunch. But even that goes south when Abbie realizes only eighth-graders get the ""real"" food -- burgers, pizza, and chicken nuggets. Bringing lunch isn't much help, since there's always something she hates. Her peers, she notices, feel the same way. Soon Abbie's leading an underground lunch swap and thinking leadership just might be one of her ""things.""
","A winningly neurotic heroine, charming artwork, and a message about learning to take risks make this story about conquering middle school worries a fun read for anyone feeling stuck in ""the Middles."" Booki Vivat's debut, Frazzled, is a fresh and funny standout in the crowded field of graphic novels about the awkwardness of middle school.
Abbie is an especially sensitive tween, and Vivat portrays her tendency to be overly dramatic with good-natured humor. Plentiful black-and-white illustrations show Abbie's runaway imagination: A tidal wave of back-to-school paperwork looms over her at the beach, her mother traps her in a bakery display case to talk about school, and her friends drift away from her, suspended from balloons. Honest, chatty Abbie is a perfect ally for kids trying to find their own way through the Middles.","Parents need to know that Frazzled deals with middle-school anxiety and stress frankly and with imaginative humor.

The Lifters,"Quirky fable promotes family, community, teamwork.","When the struggling Flowerpetal family moves to the decaying town of Carousel in search of a better life, it sets 12-year-old son Granite (hoping to be known as Gran at his new school) on the path to a fateful meeting with THE LIFTERS, a secret society formed to help keep Carousel's streets and buildings from collapsing. Things have been steadily falling apart since the town's carousel company, once world-famous, shut down. Morale is low, the citizens squabble, and buildings suddenly fall down for no reason. Middle school is pretty grim also. But Gran begins to suspect that the strange, fierce girl in his class, the only one to befriend him (when she's not punching him in the stomach), knows more than most about what's going on -- and may be doing something about it. Also, magic seems to crop up in unexpected places.
","Author Dave Eggers delivers a fun read packed with positive messages, mysterious magic, and a couple of determined 12-year-olds pitted against dark forces. En route to the cosmic battle between the town-devouring Hollows and the Lifters trying to stop them, the plot touches on real-life issues including disability, depression, unemployment -- and mortifying scenes at school.","Parents need to know that The Lifters, by Dave Eggers, is a quirky fable about magic, family, friendship, and community, set in a small town that's been slowly (and literally) collapsing ever since the local, once legendary carousel company shut down. It's warm, it's funny, it's positive -- and it's also packed with assorted troubles and human frailty that will be very relatable to some readers and too much for others. These include 12-year-old Gran's own problems (starting with being named Granite Flowerpetal), especially when he has to spend a day in pee-soaked pants because a teacher won't let him go to the restroom; his little sister's habit of barfing every time she gets excited; his artist mother's depression since the incident that left her in a wheelchair; and his father's difficulty finding work.

"Leven Thumps and the Gateway to Foo (Leven Thumps, Book 1)",Occasionally fun but too long and poorly written.,"Orphaned, mistreated Leven is contacted by a tiny creature named Clover, who informs him that he has a destiny to save two worlds: his own, and the world of dreams, called Foo. As he discovers he has the ability to see and alter the future, he meets a girl who can turn anything into ice. Together with Clover and a toothpick who was once the king of Foo, they race to destroy the gateway to Foo, pursued by the shadow minions of Sabine, who rules Foo and wants to extend his dominion over the real world. Includes map, annotated character list, and glossary.
","This book, which reads like it was written by a gifted 12-year-old, was published in its bloated, badly written, and typo-laden state by a publisher who perhaps once knew better. There was a time when editors were gimlet-eyed, erudite types who wielded a red pen like Excalibur, and had stables full of warrior monk copy editors who thought nothing of waterboarding a semi-colon until it admitted it was really a colon. Apparently those days are over, giving way to the era of the Corporate Publisher. ""There's this book,"" they must have said. ""from some little-known publisher in Utah that's selling up a storm. Buy it, and distribute it nationally.""
""But,"" one hopes at least one voice in the room piped up, ""it's bloated, badly written, and full of typos. At least let one of our editors work it over.""
""Nah. Publish it as is. It's selling just fine.""
And so the deed was done. After more than 200 pages of maundering around the neighborhood in Oklahoma, the story finally gets going, though the characters don't make it to the absurdly named Foo until nearly the end of the book. Along the way there are some flashes of excitement; no character development; a plot that, when it's not being completely derivative, doesn't make much sense; plenty of clichés; and numerous instances of the author amusing himself by throwing in weirdly inappropriate references that few kids will get, to everything from '70s pop music to Seinfeld. The movie version is due out in 2009.","Parents need to know that there is some mild fantasy violence here: attacks by several monsters, one of which is lured off a cliff to its death.

"Bright We Burn: And I Darken, Book 3","Mature, bloody trilogy meets an absorbing, satisfying end.","In BRIGHT WE BURN, Lada has taken control of Wallachia and does everything to secure her land and make her stand against the sultan, her childhood friend and sometimes lover Mehmed. When Mehmed sends representatives to secure her allegiance to the Ottoman Empire, she hammers nails in their heads until they die and sends the men home to Constantinople in a box. Mehmed is not amused. To avoid all-out war, Mehmed and Lada's brother, Radu, hatch a plan to kidnap Lada and put a cousin in place as prince of Wallachia. Lada is always steps ahead of them, out with her army demolishing the closest Ottoman soldier outposts and gathering the dead as a nasty surprise for the inevitable invasion to come.
","This blood-soaked trilogy stays absorbing and satisfying through a finale that brings out the worst and best in its two complex central characters. Lada as prince is brutal, ruthless, and clever, earning her nickname as the Impaler in a scene no reader wants to truly visualize. She's the tragic character you can see headed to her immediate end without the help of her brother, Radu. Though Radu and Lada are far apart for most of the book, they are always connected. Author Kiersten White, known for charming, lighter fare before And I Darken (Chaos of Stars, Illusions of Fate), goes deep in these characters, exploring the differences between Radu and Lada and the choices they make, often in response to the actions of the other. Radu's connection to his chosen family and his Islamic faith, his acceptance of himself as a gay man, and his reluctance to be a leader make him the perfect counter to Lada. Lada knows she needs her brother; he knows he can't escape her in the end.
All that family drama does not take away from the pace of Bright We Burn -- at least not until the very end where the wrap-up is a little long. The action is just as absorbing. Lada's forces are outnumbered but constantly outmaneuvering the Ottomans. Readers will feel conflicted about just who to root for. Radu is the ""good"" choice, but Lada is cunning and relentless. It's both shocking and fascinating to see what strategies she employs in her brutal campaign. The whole series fascinates, and it's hard to see it end.","Parents need to know that Bright We Burn is the third and final book in the And I Darken series by Kiersten White, author of the popular Paranormalcy trilogy. Set in the Ottoman Empire (15th century) and offering many details about the period, this story is based on the life of Vlad the Impaler (the inspiration for Dracula), had Vlad been a female named Lada instead. Bright We Burn, like the rest of the series, is best for high school readers and up who are ready for the mature content and able to more fully contemplate the complex themes. Here we see very clearly where Lada got her brutal nickname. Thousands of soldiers are killed in many skirmishes and then displayed on stakes all together. Nails are hammered into men's heads until they die. Gore is well described in hand-to-hand combat: A man's throat is torn out and other men are killed brutally. There are assassinations with knives and crossbow, and one man is stabbed repeatedly in retaliation. Some deaths are huge losses to the main characters. Heterosexual sex is described as rough and passionate with few concrete details. Gay and lesbian characters kiss. Language and drinking by comparison are both tame. Astute readers can ponder how the main characters -- two siblings raised together -- can end up choosing such different paths in life.

"One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish",Infectious rhymes great for early reading or read-aloud.,"\""From there to here,/ from here to there,/ funny things/ are everywhere.\"" That's what ONE FISH, TWO FISH, RED FISH, BLUE FISH is about in a nutshell: funny fish and other creatures going about their lives while being observed by -- or interacting with -- a little boy and his sister. The little boy narrator points out their distinctive characteristics -- \""This one has a little star./ This one has a little car./ Say! what a lot/ of fish there are.\"" And sometimes the creatures speak directly to the reader: \""Who am I?/ My name is Ned./ I do not like/ my little bed.\""
","Simple, infectious  rhymes and real and imagined creatures (like a seven hump wump) in funny scenes make this a wonderful read-aloud and a perfect early reader. The rhymes invite kids to fill words in and sound words out. And somehow the inventive wordplay and comic sight gags never get old. Even the silliest sing-song rhymes are just plain fun to say, like, ""I have this dish/ to help me wish,"" which is only the beginning of a major tongue twister.","Parents need to know that One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish is a classic Dr. Seuss book that works as a either a fun read-aloud or a manageable early reader.

"Alexander Hamilton: The Making of America, Book 1","Succinct, kid-friendly bio of America's trendiest founder.","ALEXANDER HAMILTON: THE MAKING OF AMERICA is a brief but surprisingly in-depth biography for middle-grade readers by author Teri Kanefield. It traces Hamilton's journey from being a humble West Indian raised without a father to being General Washington's aide-de camp and trusted advisor, to his successes and failures in the sphere of politics and the drafting of the Constitution and the Federalist Papers, to his foundational role in the creation of the United States Treasury and the first national bank. Kanefield highlights the once-polarizing figure's enduring legacy and impressive foresight into the trajectory of American history. Self-conscious of his humble origins, fiercely opposed by jealous rivals, and intellectually superior to all challengers, Hamilton's tragically brief but remarkable life and career are the embodiment of the American dream as envisioned by the Founding Fathers, the esteemed pantheon of which he is certainly a member.
","Informative and exciting, this dynamic story flies by in a flash, much like the titular hero. The writing in Alexander Hamilton: The Making of America is uniformly strong, peppered with solid sections of historical context, suitable introductions to basic political theories, and bits and pieces of quotes from primary sources. While the biography seems well-researched and provides citations in the endnotes, it would be nice if writers of history for younger readers weren't so shy about showing the work that went into reconstructing the record. Seeing the origins and details of where historical conclusions are drawn from is what makes the evidence reliable and relatable. That being said, the book dovetails nicely with the way American history is taught in elementary and middle school, and Alexander Hamilton is one of the most important actors in that drama.","Parents need to know that Alexander Hamilton: The Making of America is a sweeping, informative, yet digestible introduction to the life and times of one of the most influential figures in the story of the early United States. The biography serves as an excellent supplement for middle schoolers learning about American history and government or for anyone who fell in love with Hamilton on Broadway (or just the cast lbum) and wants a more straightforward presentation of the material. Nicely illustrated with black-and-white images of etchings, portraits, paintings, and historical documents.

The Big Field,"Action-packed, emotional dad-son baseball story.","When shortstop Hutch is moved to second base on his team to make room for more talented, but arrogant, new player Darryl, he rolls with the punches for the good of the team. But when he sees his own father, who never seems to have any time for or interest in him, coaching Darryl, he can't handle it, and endangers both what's left of his relationship with his dad, and his team's chances in the championship.
","Most good sports books are exciting, suspenseful, and action-packed, and this one is too -- the many game and practice scenes are fast-paced and lovingly described. Here's what some of the best baseball books are: lyrical, almost poetic, in their attempt to capture that indefinable feeling that makes baseball different from any other sport. This one is too -- Lupica's sharp and rhythmic prose brilliantly captures the passion, joy, intelligence, and beauty of the summertime sport.
Here's what most of those other books are not: moving, powerfully emotional, as much concerned with the characters as with the sports action. But this one is. There's really only one other writer who can pack this much emotion and sheer intelligence into sports fiction for kids: Bruce Brooks, and he hasn't had a new novel in years. Lupica deftly uses Hutch's rivalry with Darryl to lay bare Hutch's troubled relationship with his distant and disappointed father, who has given up on life and wants Hutch to do the same. This is what you hope for when you recommend a sports book to reluctant readers: action that will keep them riveted to the page in a story will help deepen their understanding of the game, of people, and of life.","Parents need to know that, aside from the mentions of some products, there is nothing to be concerned about here. Hutch, despite some understandable mistakes, is a great role model of conscious sportsmanship and team playing.

The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian,"Funny, gritty, and powerful novel of growing up on the rez.","Junior has more than his fair share of burdens. He was born hydrocephalic, and he lives on an Indian reservation where there is little hope or money, but plenty of alcoholics, including his parents. His sister hardly ever comes out of the basement. He gets beaten up a lot for looking weird. But he has a few things going for him too. He's smart, good at drawing and basketball, and, unlike his friends and relatives, he has ambition and hope. But when he decides to reach for more by going to a white school 22 miles away, his burdens grow even greater.
 
","What sounds in summary like a tale of unremitting woe is, in the hands of Sherman Alexie and illustrator Ellen Forney, powerfully moving and grimly witty. Junior's sincere and sardonic voice is expressed not only in his writing, but also in his comics about his life, family, and friends. This device contributes a lightness to even the darkest moments, and allows Junior's anger and wit to come shining through.
 

The hopelessness of life on the rez is almost inconceivable to those who don't live it, and Junior is determined and relentless in his quest to succeed and escape. This is not about coming to terms with the richness of one's culture. Though Junior has tremendous affection for his family, home, and tribe, he knows, and his parents know, that his only chance of a decent life is to claw his way out. In a book with many sad moments, that may be the saddest thing of all.
 ","Parents need to know that this National Book Award winner presents a powerful look at the life of Native Americans on reservation, and the struggles one teen faces in an effort to escape. There is some gritty material including swearing, racism, homophobia, references to masturbation, erections -- and alcoholism is a major theme. Teens get in a number of fistfights and three people close to the main character die. Yet teen readers will get a lot from Junior's story: his sincere and sardonic voice is expressed not only in his writing but in his comics about his life, family, and friends. This device contributes a lightness to even the darkest moments, and allows Junior's anger and wit to come shining through.

Weird Little Robots,Girls find friendship and love of science in engaging story.,"As WEIRD LITTLE ROBOTS begins, shy 11-year-old Penny Rose is new to the neighborhood and spends all her time alone, tinkering with robots in the shed in her backyard. When the robots seem to come alive, her world changes. She becomes best friends with Lark, her quirky birdwatching neighbor and classmate, and is asked to join a secret science club at school. The problem is, the group only wants Penny Rose, not Lark, who has long been shunned by the kids at school. Penny Rose’s robots have been a big part of her happiness, but she puts them -- and her friendship with Lark -- in danger to join the club.
","This engaging robot tale mixes science and friendship in  well-told story that unfolds slowly, with lots of detail and attention to the inner thoughts and feelings of Penny Rose and Lark. Weird Little Robots celebrates quirks and friendship and how valuable it is to be authentic. The girls are free to be themselves when they’re together, shedding insecurities and not worrying about being cool or measuring up to someone else’s standards. More advanced readers will likely fly through the pages, while anyone still getting used to longer chapter books will take their time to enjoy the story.","Parents need to know that science, invention, and friendship intersect beautifully in Caroline Crimi’s Weird Little Robots, illustrated by Corinna Luyken.  By slowly building engaging characters, the story is full but not rushed, and each character’s quirks become endearing. Science is constant throughout, from tinkering with robots to birdwatching and more. Readers who like longer sentences, more advanced vocabulary, and a detailed story will likely stay engaged, and it could be challenging for readers who prefer shorter, sharper chapters.

Seven Wonders Book 4: The Curse of the King,Gifted kids infiltrate the enemy in action-focused fantasy.,"Jack, Cass, and Aly ll are live and thinking of settling back into their lives in the United States when a horrible reminder of their genetic condition jolts them back to reality. Aly lies dying in a hospital bed in California, and Jack, Cass, and Jack's father rush to her side. Jack wonders why he and Cass are still healthy until he realizes the shard he carries around of a broken Loculus has magic healing properties. He saves Aly with it, but it's at a cost: The shard shrinks before his eyes and will soon be too small to keep them all healthy. So Jack does what he does best -- hatches a plan. And it's a daring one, to get captured by the enemy Massa while tracking down the next of seven Loculi and go back to the secret island they now rule to find the other shards of the healing Loculus -- then try to escape in one piece. It's a plan that will either save their lives or kill them.
","Readers who've already found three Loculi with Aly, Cass, Jack, and sometimes Marco should be satisfied enough with THE CURSE OF THE KING. We find out more about Jack's mystery Massa mom, get a reunion with Marco, and watch the main characters enact a pretty daring plan to save themselves. It all goes by pretty fast with plenty of action fight scenes. Perhaps too fast.
As usual, the series chooses action over careful character development. Sure, it's cool that Jack and friends are so talented -- that's clear -- but in all the foursome's life-threatening situations, you'd expect to see lots more friend bonding and personality on the page.","Parents need to know that Peter Lerangis' The Curse of the King is the fourth book in the Seven Wonders series, which sets four 13-year-olds on adventures to find seven sources of power, each hidden in one of the ancient wonders of the world. In this installment, they spend the least amount of time hunting the Seventh Wonder in question, the Statue of Zeus, in Greece nd more time on a secret island fighting baddies. Three times, characters are feared dead for a few chapters or a few pages -- seemingly killed by explosion or choking or flatlining in a hospital bed -- but turn out to be alive. One man does die from fever, and friends start to bury him. Expect plenty of action sequences using fists, falls from cliffs, a deliberate car crash that flips a car, tranquilizers, a crowbar, knives, and guns. Mostly people are knocked unconscious or burned. The talented main characters are brave and resourceful and work well together to survive. All of them need special treatments to stay alive, thanks to the genetic defect that marks them as both gifted and as descendants of Atlantis.

The Three Little Pigs (Folk Tale Classics),"Charming, sweetly illustrated version of classic story.","A mother pig sends her THREE LITTLE PIGS out into the world to seek their fortunes, and each builds a house. The first little pig builds a house of straw, but a wolf blows down that house and eats the pig. The second little pig builds a house of sticks, but the same wolf blows it down and eats the pig. The third pig builds a strong house of bricks, so when the wolf comes to the door, he can't blow the house down. The wolf devises several schemes to trick the third pig into leaving his house so the wolf can eat him, but the pig outsmarts the wolf every time. Finally, the wolf tries to sneak down the pig's chimney, but the pig places a pot of water to boil over the fire, and when the wolf falls in, the pig cooks the wolf and eats him for supper.
","This sweetly illustrated edition of the classic story is a faithful retelling, for good and bad.

Homeland,Tense hacker adventure tackles government spying on public.,"A few years after the events in Little Brother, former teen ""hacktivist"" Marcus Yallow finds himself unemployed and unable to continue his education under the burden of student loans. While at the Burning Man festival, he's given a thumb drive by two ex-compatriots, who are later kidnapped by one of their most implacable nemeses. Back in San Francisco, Marcus starts working for an idealistic state senate candidate. But he can't ignore the devastating documents he has received. Can he find a way to distribute them without imperiling his boss' campaign?
","HOMELAND is an engaging, thoughtful, and impassioned exploration of the ways in which technology fosters and inhibits communication and security. Though it may not have the immediacy and novelty of its predecessor, Little Brother, it still vividly addresses issues that should concern anyone who values his or her privacy.
Marcus and his rough-and-tumble hacker compatriots are an intriguing bunch, and they're pitted against some ruthless and equally resourceful villains. Author Cory Doctorow knows how to keep raising the stakes, delivering plenty of suspense without resorting to cheap plot tricks. The narration sometimes descends into jargon, but Doctorow does his best to explicate clearly the science and engineering behind the high-tech gadgetry. This is a book likely to inspire readers, to shake them up, make them mad and point them in new directions to channel that energy.","Parents need to know that Cory Doctorow's Homeland is a near-future science fiction novel that takes a very realistic approach to subjects like government surveillance, torture, and civil disobedience. In this sequel to Little Brother, the characters don't always act within the letter of the law, even though the protagonist and his friends always struggle to do what's right. The language is fairly strong, and there are a few scenes of physical violence (characters are kidnapped, assaulted, tased, beaten, tear-gassed, and threatened with torture), but there's not much bloodshed. Overall, the level of violence is less intense than in Little Brother. The main, college-age character and his longtime girlfriend have a sexually intimate relationship, though it's not presented in any detail.

Is There Really a Human Race?,Fanciful images send a refreshing message.,"While hanging out in the park with his mom, a child wonders whether or not there really is a human race. Throughout the following pages, he continues to wonder about what kind of race it would be, how that race should be run, and what is to be gained. In the end, he concludes that racing may not be what life is all about. Perhaps there are other ways to \""make the world better for the whole human race.\""
","Jamie Lee Curtis and illustrator Laura Cornell have teamed up to create a wonderfully energetic book with a solid, wholesome message for us all. The message is told more effectively by the illustrations than by the somewhat sing-songy poetry. The first page sets up the question clearly and boldly: ""Is there really a human race?"" Seemingly a play on words, the immensity of this question reverberates throughout the rest of the book as the boy ponders various implications of the word ""race.""
Drawings and words combine effectively to take the reader through the pressures and complications of humans racing, all of which the boy realizes may end in a crash. He concludes we should all slow down, do our best, and work with one another. The symmetry of this story is amazing, the illustrations remarkable, and the message refreshing.","Parents need to know that nothing harmful is presented in this book -- the message is fun, wholesome, and energetic.

Kids will zip through this tale faster than the messenger Smimf in his seven-league boots, pausing mainly for interludes of the giggles. While there's plenty of cartoonish silliness in the story's pacing and development, some of the characters are dealing with issues -- coping with difficult family members, discovering the value of friends, trying to be a better person -- that have a lot in common with real life.

Merci has big shoes to fill: Her brother Roli is a star high school student who's almost too old to care about Merci's sixth grade challenges. And thanks to the popular crowd at Seaward Pines Academy, Merci has plenty of challenges. How can she keep from being the butt of Edna Santos' zinger comments when her Papi drives a beat-up painting van, her bike seat is losing its stuffing, and her darned eye won't stop wandering? On top of that, a new cute boy from Minnesota has been assigned to Merci as her ""Sunshine Buddy"" -- a duty of the school's welcoming committee -- which means Merci's every move is being scrutinized by the popular girls. At home, her grandfather is behaving strangely, which turns Merci's world upside down.
","Fascinating in its depiction of Cuban American culture, this optimistic story portrays immigrant life in South Florida. Kids will relate to the OMG-so-awkward moments that Merci suffers in sixth grade.

What Merci has that those kids might not is a rich family tradition that's so woven into her core values that she's unaware of how lucky she is. Sure, she shares a room with her brother and is obligated to watch her twin cousins after school, but the pride she takes in playing on her Papi's soccer team, and the loving relationship she shares with her grandfather, Lolo, are priceless. Author Meg Medina immerses Merci Suarez Changes Gears in a culture that many readers might not be intimately familiar with. The ""Gilda"" crackers, the Noche-buena Christmas Eve traditions, the delicious food her abuela cooks, and most of all, the closeness that defines many immigrant families.

	\ Within a few weeks, Garnet falls for a youth pastor, witnesses her aunt's mysterious healing, gets to know and love her extended family, and unexpectedly meets her father. When tragedy leaves her heartbroken, she turns to family for support.
","While this story flirts with heavy themes -- feeling abandoned, being raised by a single mother, economic hardship, coping with terminal illness -- it never really engages with any of them. Garnet remains a fairly thin character, despite the first-person narration. It's obvious how she feels about the improbably named Silver Shepherd, but her feelings about her parents and what she experiences at the churches is superficial. More disappointing is that the thorniest problems are resolved so lightly: by faith healing, by clearing up a simple misunderstanding, by looking for the bright side. The melodrama reaches a height just four pages before the novel abruptly ends. What had potential to be a solid coming-of-age novel winds up a ho-hum romance.
	Nevertheless, Ruth White draws a warm portrait of the Rose family and their Appalachian community. Young tweens might enjoy this glimpse into a time when television was still a novelty.","Parents need to know that this very tame romance by the Newbery Award-winning author of Belle Prater's Boy (1996) is set in Appalachia in the 1950s, when boys still needed to ask permission to court a young girl. Religion plays a central role, but mostly in setting the scene. Garnet visits churches where people speak in tongues, handle dangerous snakes, and perform faith healing, but there's little discussion of how any of the characters feel about God. The real emotional focus is on finding faith and strength with family.

Love (and Other Uses for Duct Tape),"So-so sequel with teen pregnancy, mean girl, and a gay ex.","This book takes place where the first installment, Tips on Having a Gay (Ex) Boyfriend, left off: Belle is in her senior year of high school, and is still dealing with her gay ex-boyfriend, a mean girl who has it in for her, and a strange neighbor, who is trying to make up for attacking her at school. What's more, she also discovers that her best friend is pregnant -- just as she and her own boyfriend think they might be ready to take their relationship to the next level. And she is having seizures again.
","Belle's problems, even the more subtle ones, may intrigue readers. How do you support a pregnant friend? Why doesn't her dreamy boyfriend seem to want to have sex with her? Why does she always try to explain everything that everybody does? Is she secretly very selfish? The problem here is the same as in Jones' first installment: In the middle of her intriguing plot and striking writing, she dumps all the quirky small-town characters. For starters, there's Belle's duct tape-obsessed boyfriend, and her best friend who takes photos constantly so she won't forget anyone. These contrived characters deplete any connection that readers might feel for Belle or the people she cares about. Fans of the first installment might find enough to like here. Everyone else might as well skip this volume -- and hope that Jones moves on to another town for her next writing adventure.","Parents need to know that in this sequel to Tips on Having a Gay (Ex) Boyfriend, a central plot point is about Belle dealing with her best friend's pregnancy -- and her own decision to have sex with her boyfriend. There is some salty language, and a mean girl tries to humiliate Belle by spreading nasty rumors. This story will get teens thinking about relationships, growing up, bullying, and rumors.

Jacob's New Dress,"Cheery book on dismantling gender norms helps kids, parents.","In JACOB'S NEW DRESS, Jacob loves to wear dresses: the princess costume at his school's dress-up corner, a witch dress he wore for Halloween, even a homemade dress he fashioned from a towel. His classmate, Christopher, insists boys don't wear dresses and tears away his homemade dress. Jacob's friend Emily and his parents assure him it's fine to wear a dress, and his mom helps him sew a real dress -- purple, with ruffles. Wearing what he wants helps Jacob feel so comfortable, he finds Christopher's taunts have lost their power.
","This compassionate, encouraging story is helpful for both children and their parents. What seems so simple for a young child -- wearing what makes him feel good -- can seem much more complicated for people who care for him, as parents and co-authors Sarah and Ian Hoffman know well. They drew on their own experience to write Jacob's New Dress.
The story is told simply, enlivened by illustrator Chris Case's expressive characters and vibrant style. Jacob senses his parents' uncertainty but clearly feels supported -- parents will recognize their hesitation and resolve to stand by Jacob. The resolution may feel a little too easy for families of children who are targeted by bullies: It's a joy to see Jacob refuse to let his bully hamper his spirit, but for most victimized kids it isn't so easy. Still, this is an excellent book for starting a conversation with kids and for parents feeling their way through unfamiliar terrain.","Parents need to know that Jacob's New Dress is about a confident young boy who feels best when he's wearing a dress. Co-authors Sarah and Ian Hoffman, themselves parents of a gender-nonconforming child, target the book to help both children who might feel like they don't fit in and their parents, who may be unsure of how to handle such situations. The story is unwaveringly supportive of Jacob, who so desires to wear what he wants that he creates his own dress for school. There's a bully who seems to be learning intolerance from his father, but Jacob's compassionate best friend supports him and his other classmates don't seem to pay much attention to it.

Indian No More,Moving story of Umpqua family relocated to LA in '50s.,"INDIAN NO MORE is  historical novel by Charlene Willing McManis,  member of the Umpqua tribe (with posthumous help from author Traci Sorell). The story tells of the mass relocation efforts by the U.S. government of Native American tribes in the 1950s. Told through fifth grader Regina Petit's point of view, it's about a girl whose Native American identity is challenged when she and her family move to urban Los Angeles. Regina and her family are members of the Grand Ronde tribe, who come from a reservation near Salem, Oregon. When the U.S. government enacts a decree terminating their tribal rights, Regina's dad decides to take the Bureau of Indian Affairs' offer to relocate to a big city to learn a new trade and start a new life. Regina copes with major culture shock, never having eaten in a restaurant before and never having seen a television. The tribal school she had gone to was two rooms full of people who all knew one another, or were otherwise family. In Los Angeles, however, Regina and her little sister, Peewee, find that they have to figure out a lot about their identity very quickly in order to hold on to the things that are important to them, or else assimilate in ways that are expected of them.
","A dramatic and touching tale of cultural assimilation, this story fills an important historical gap. Indian No More shows how forcing people from their land affects generations of people. The struggle that Regina undergoes to learn about herself in the context of White society is extremely moving. When her family is told that their people re no longer recognized as a tribe, Regina personally attempts to understand what this means. It means that she is seen as foreign, even though her people have inhabited the country longer than the European Americans who dominate it. It means that she's called names. It means that though the American dream is achievable to some degree, the loss of identity might take a major toll.
What makes this story good, and why kids will like it, is that the struggle is told with the clarity and honesty that only a kid can call forth. It's not cut and pasted from an experience and put into another time and place. It feels real, because it was real. It's a nice addition to the middle grade historical fiction canon.","Parents need to know that Indian No More is a novel set in the 1950s about a Native American family who are moved from their home on the Grand Ronde Indian Reservation in Oregon to Los Angeles, as directed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Ten-year-old Regina's tribe had been ""terminated"" by the U.S. government, which means that their tribal identity was no longer recognized by the government, and they lost rights to their ancestral home and their house. Consequently, and for other historical reasons as told by her elders, Regina's family teaches her to be suspicious of the government or any government officials. In her new Los Angeles community, Regina copes with being called names, having eggs thrown at her, and having her friends called the ""N"" word (spelled out) when she's with them. She wonders if she's ""the right kind of Indian"" when compared with stereotypes played out in TV shows and movies. Young men on the reservation smoke and drink beer. Adults smoke, drink, and act out while under the influence.

This collection of four short stories begins by explaining how Dog Man was surgically created after a police officer and his canine companion were badly injured in an explosion. Subsequent chapters pit Dog Man against his nemesis, Petey the cat, as Petey participates in a nefarious plot to replace the police chief with a robot who'll follow the mayor's every command; erases all the world's books and makes everyone insufferably dumb; nd tries to destroy all dogs while triggering the creation of an army of animated hot dogs. In each story, Dog Man's cleverness helps him cuff the cat.
","The always cheeky Dav Pilkey stays true to form with this unapologetically giddy comic series start featuring a clever dog-hearted cop devoted to his job -- nd his boss. Dog Man features typical bathroom humor (readers will solve the mystery of who pooped in the police chief's office long before the chief does), but it also has an unabashed sweet streak. When the chief feels he hasn't a friend in the world, Dog Man stays by his side, despite a history of being scolded by his boss.
The graphic novel is supposed to look as if it were drawn by fourth-graders for fourth-graders, and some parents will recognize their own children's sense of humor in this.

There are some misspellings and poor grammar nd a lot of juvenile humor involving bodily functions, explosions, and a drawing of a bare bottom.

Mira's Diary: Home Sweet Rome,"Time-travel sequel is intense, suspenseful, and exciting.","In the second volume in Marissa Moss' Mira's Diary series, 14-year-old Mira Levin -- who shares her mother's ability to time-travel -- receives another note from her mom. Mrs. Levin is living in turn-of-the-17th-century Rome and is trying to prevent events that she says will affect her children's future. Mira must go to Rome, and back in time, to help her mom. Following cryptic clues, Mira finds herself employed by Monsignore Del Monte, a patron to the great artist Caravaggio, who also becomes part of the story. Mira learns that she must preserve the writings of a philosopher named Giordano Bruno, whose life is threatened by the Inquisition. While trying to save Bruno, in a strange city in a dangerous time, Mira must also dodge the Watchers -- time-travel police who don't want her to meddle in the past.
","Marissa Moss' second Mira's Diary novel is as ambitious and suspenseful as the first, nd teaches much about great Italian art and architecture as well as the history of scientific thought. Whereas some of the ideas and historical background may be over young readers' heads to varying degrees, the book can be enjoyed on a variety of levels. Some readers may simply be gripped the suspenseful story; others may like digging deep into the problem of why the 16th-century Roman Catholic church considered scientists their enemies. This is an exciting, eye-opening adventure story that will appeal especially to young art lovers, budding scientists, and history buffs.","Parents need to know that Mira's Diary: Home Sweet Rome is the second book in the Mira's Diary series.

She inwardly explores complex philosophical and scientific ideas as a result. Though some of the concepts Mira touches on may be over the heads of middle-grade readers, those kids can certainly follow Mira's suspenseful adventure with interest and understand the essential concepts of fairness and freedom of expression that are at issue. Cruelty to children can be especially upsetting to young readers, so some kids may be disturbed by the inhuman conditions Mira endures when she's thrown in jail (rats, wormy gruel to eat, despair). There's also a scene where a man who was previously jailed for expressing controversial ideas is burned at the stake.

At home, he's dealing with an aggressively positive mother, an emotionally explosive younger brother, and a beloved grandfather in poor health. At school, he's frustrated and bewildered by the girls in his class: Claudine is the worst of the bossy ones, but why does he feel so confused by her?

With their wacky but always cool teacher by their side, they go inside the Earth, explore climate change, get up close with dinosaurs, etc. There's a lot of information to absorb: Along with the story's text, kids pick up more information through the students' dialogue, their reports -- which run along the sides of the page -- and detailed illustrations, which show, for example, all the different ways neighbors produce carbon dioxide by working and traveling around their homes.
","There's a reason this has become such a long-standing hit with kids -- and parents, too! For more than 20 years, Ms. Frizzle and her class have helped break down basic scientific information into chunks that kids can easily digest and remember. The fun gimmicks -- like the ever-changing bus and Ms. Frizzle's ever-changing outfits, which reflect each book's theme -- will keep kids engaged as they devour book after book in this series. Because the books are text-heavy, they work better when kids can read them themselves; a read-aloud will simply take too long. But, parents, you should get on the bus, too.

 Nate is a terrific hero for underdogs of all types. His anxieties and insecurities belie an easygoing, roll-with-the-punches strength. Nate doesn't challenge bullies directly but endures with humor and an arsenal of coping techniques that put him on top.

He's still getting over the physical and emotional trauma of being severely beaten by some classmates the year before and is at odds with his mother, who's not accepted his decision to come out as transgender. A summer with his supportive and understanding aunt seems the best choice for everyone. A summer where everyone will assume he's a boy. Chris, a runner and astronomy nerd, doesn't have high expectations for his time in Carson and certainly doesn't expect to fall in love for the first time. Then he meets Maia, the girl next door, who's struggling after a family tragedy.

Islandborn,Vibrant memories of Caribbean island celebrate heritage.,"In ISLANDBORN, Lola goes to a school where every kid is ""from somewhere else."" Her teacher, Ms. Obi, instructs the kids to ""draw a picture of the country you are originally from,"" but Lola doesn't remember her country of birth since she left when she was a baby. She decides to ask others in her neighborhood who do remember, and they enthusiastically tell her about the music, dancing, mangoes, beaches, heat, hurricanes, and colors. But they also hint at darker memories, and Lola finds out from her super (the superintendent of her building) about a ""monster"" who terrorized the island until ""heroes rose up"" and fought and banished him. By the end, Lola has collected so many images that she's able to make a whole book about the island instead of just one picture.
","It's not every day that a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist writes a picture book, and this one vibrantly celebrates diversity by mining the author's own Dominican American experience. In Islandborn, the many shaded brown-skinned kids in Lola's school hail from a whole host of countries, and her New York City neighborhood is full of friends who can tell her about the island home of her birth. Author Junot Díaz makes the decision not to name the Dominican Republic, referring to it simply as ""the Island."" He also references the brutal dictator Rafael Trujillo who ruled for 30 years, but refers to him obliquely as ""the Monster,"" and the art pictures him as an actual monster, not a man. This might confuse some kids, who might take the word ""monster"" literally, so parents and teachers can fill in the actual history.
The art by Leo Espinosa is wildly colorful, as befits a book about an island that has ""colorful cars, colorful houses, flowers everywhere. Even the people are like a rainbow -- every shade ever made."" And it's even more fun that Espinosa's art is incorporated into the pictures Lola herself is painting for her school project. The book celebrates the vibrancy of the Dominican American immigrant community, hinting at the darker forces that prompted people to leave their beloved island home.","Parents need to know that Islandborn is by Junot Díaz who won the 2008 Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award for The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, a novel for adults.

She asks family members and neighbors to tell her what they remember, and one neighbor tells her about a period when ""a monster fell upon our poor island,"" a reference to dictator Rafael Trujillo, though he's never named.

The cartoony plot of FRANK EINSTEIN AND THE BRAINTURBO certainly has some fun stretching the limits of scientific possibility -- such as a Brain Swirler to control other people's minds, and a chimpanzee with villainous aspirations -- but there's much to learn about brain waves, the senses, and human emotion.

Since childhood, each time he closes his eyes, Nolan has been drawn into Amara’s life; however, most people who admit to hearing voices and seeing people who aren't there are diagnosed with schizophrenia. So, rather than tell his parents the truth, Nolan claims to have epileptic seizures to explain his spasms of unconsciousness when he spends hours in Amara’s world.
Amara spends every waking moment in servitude. From a young age she’s been told she carries the rare ability to heal the injured and so is held captive as the princess's personal healer. If the princess, trapped by a death curse, so much as scratches her knee, the walls come down around her, lightning bolts in her direction, and grass grows so fiercely it cuts her to pieces. Amara’s duty is to bear this pain until she magically heals herself. Amara doesn't see her freedom within reach until she witnesses something unexpected. Together, Nolan and Amara hold more power than they realize, but each must reach deep enough to free the other.
","Otherbound will require reflection long after the book is finished. Author Corinne Duyvis writes bout self-identification through language, and the complexity and depth take time to absorb. Half the novel is written through the eyes of a boy trapped in a girl’s body, which introduces the reader to the transgendered mind, and the novel also explores the tender love between two girls.
Otherbound suggests that there are many truths and that truth may not be tangible. By book's end, the reader will be questioning everything -- and when it comes to understanding human nature, that's probably a good thing.","Parents need to know that Otherbound is chock-full of violence. Although the violence takes place in a fantasy realm called the Dunelands, it bears a striking resemblance to the ongoing issues in the Middle East. The main character Amara is a teenage servant whose earliest memory is of her tongue being cut out. Servant women from the Dunelands don't need their tongues because they're not meant to be heard. Amara is frequently beaten by her male captor, and at one point her nose is broken from being slammed into a porcelain bowl. One man is killed in a fistfight, and a magic curse causes the natural world to attack Amara if she attempts to escape. Teens engage in consensual sexual relationships, and two girls share a passionate kiss. LGBTQ themes are explored.

Eleven,Poignant tale of dyslexic boy seeking clues to his past.,"Sam, who can barely read, lives with his grandfather and an unusual extended family. As he approaches his 11th birthday, he's haunted by fear of that number and strange dreams in which it's prominently featured. When he discovers an old newspaper article with his picture and the word ""missing,"" he's worried that his life is not what he thought it was. So he enlists the help of new classmate Caroline to read the article, track down the clues, and find out who he really is.
","This lovely, poignant mystery will not be to every kid's taste -- there's no action and there are no villains. But veteran author Patricia Reilly Giff doesn't need them to craft an utterly engrossing, deeply moving page-turner. There are many pleasures here, from Sam's touching friendship with Caroline to his delightful alternative family -- with his parents dead, he lives with his grandfather over their woodworking shop, next to a deli and a restaurant, whose owners live over them as well. Together the boy and three single adults form an unusual but very workable family, taking care of one another and parenting Sam.
Sam's reading difficulties are also beautifully described, as are the reactions of those in his life. He doesn't live in fear of others finding out -- pretty much everyone knows. Instead, he has given up on it ever getting better and has learned to make the most of his other talents. But his extended family, friends, and teachers have not given up on him, and, while supporting his talents, they make sure he doesn't close the door on reading.","Parents need to know that Eleven, by Patricia Reilly Giff, is the story of a dyslexic boy, Sam, whose mother is dead and who lives with his grandfather and an unusual extended family of neighbors.

"The Last Full Measure: Divided We Fall, Book 3",A rousing finale for saga of a second U.S. Civil War.,"Danny Wright started the Second American Civil War, but he thinks his fighting days are over now that the Feds have left Idaho. But the entire world is thrown into chaos again when nuclear blasts destroy New York City and Washington, D.C. Soon Danny and his friends are worrying about food shortages and the thugs who make up the Brotherhood of the White Eagle. The only way for Danny and his crew to live as free citizens may be to cross a ravaged Idaho and find a secluded place where they can build a society of their own.
","Many dystopian novels start well after civilization has collapsed, but this highly realistic tale of a second American Civil War demonstrates how quickly the social order might unravel in the U.S. Author Trent Reedy poses difficult questions about loyalty, patriotism, and citizenship, pitting his teen characters against an onslaught of obstacles. Although full of action and suspense, THE LAST FULL MEASURE de-glamorizes war and enumerates its awful costs. Having matured under fire, Danny and his friends must make some terrible sacrifices. Readers who persevere through all three volumes of the trilogy will find themselves amply rewarded.","Parents need to know that The Last Full Measure is the final book in the series that began with Divided We Fall. It presents a hard-hitting, realistic depiction of what might happen in the event of a second American Civil War. The language is rough but realistic given the circumstances, with frequent use of ""damn,"" ""hell,"" ""s--t,"" ""bulls--t,""and ""a--hole"" nd occasional use of ""p---y,"" ""d--k,"" ""prick,"" ""bitch,"" ""bastard,"" and ""pissed."" Daniel and JoBell clearly have a sexually intimate relationship, but their time alone is not detailed. Violence plays a big part in the narrative. Friends and foes alike are killed by missiles, gunfire, swords, and a public hanging. Much of the Eastern Seaboard is destroyed in two nuclear attacks.

"Afternoon on the Amazon: Magic Tree House, Book 6",One of the weaker entries in the series.,"A troop of flesh-eating army ants sets in motion a chain of events, taking Jack and Annie into a canoe without paddles, drifting down the Amazon. Piranhas, crocodiles, and snake-draped trees carry the story along as the duo searches for the second of four objects needed to release Morgan le Fay from a spell. Peanut the mouse accompanies them on their journey; a vine-swinging monkey provides the needed object.
","Snakes and crocs provide the standard elements of drama, but fall short of any heightened excitement; no real danger gets too close as the twosome stumbles along, evading one creature after another. Annie, the animal lover, here is terrified of all bugs, which surprises even Jack. The needed object, through no effort of their own, falls into their lap as an unwanted gift, which adds to mystery but detracts from the magic.","Parents need to know that there's nothing objectionable, but nothing too exciting here either.

The Dunderheads,Teamwork trumps an evil teacher; too scary for preschoolers.,"The teacher thinks she has a classroom full of misfits. The students know they have a tyrant for a teacher. When she makes one mistake too many, the kids all pool their individual talents to help fix the problem and show the teacher that a bunch of ""dunderheads"" can be successful.
","Older kids will love this story about how a motley group of students pool their unique talents to finally overcome their domineering, evil teacher. The aptly-named Miss Breakbone is not someone to tangle with, and she has ""no eye for talent,"" and gives herself a gold star every time she makes a student cry.  Of course, each of her students, whom she has labeled as ""dunderheads"" has a talent, of sorts:  Einstein is the brain, Pencil can draw from memory, Clips builds amazing things with paper clips, and so on. Together they are more than a match for Miss Breakbone's evil maneuverings.
Not only is the story rewarding, in that the innocent underdogs conquer the bully, but the writing is also entertaining and the artwork is packed with intriguing detail that will capture any reader's interest. However, because of the creepy and effectively evil illustrations, the electric chair, the growling ferocious dogs, the spikes and chains, and the less-than-favorable impression of teachers, this book is best for less sensitive readers.  The watercolor, pen, and ink cartooning is unique and expressive. The mean, domineering teacher is creepy, scary, and very evil-looking. The kids each have unique style, and the gadgets are intriguing. ","Parents need to know that this is not a book for younger kids. Most older kids will love the humor. However, the message is complicated (the teacher is evil, and the students work together to end her tyranny), and the cartoons are a bit scary (the classroom has an electric chair; there are ferocious dogs, etc.) The book is best for kids who have some experience with school and understand that this isn't a realistic portrayal of teachers and school.

They crashland in Europe and are taken into custody by agents of the International Alliance. No one believes Mia and Jules, though, insisting the invasion to be a hoax. Jules and Mia must escape and find absolute proof that Earth is about to be taken over by hostile extraterrestrials.
","Moving from the marvelous to the mundane can be jarring, and this mostly earthbound follow-up to a high-flying adventure in space may slightly disappoint faithful readers. Authors Amie Kaufman and Meagan Spooner make their lead characters Jules and Mia as adorable as ever, but running around Europe isn't quite as interesting as exploring an ancient, puzzle-filled, alien spacecraft. There's still plenty of crisp, quirky dialogue, and the action never flags, which may be enough for readers seeking a new spin on alien invasions.","Parents need to know that Undying is the second half of the science-fiction adventure begun in Unearthed, from the writing team of Amie Kaufman nd Meagan Spooner.

He turns to the World's Best Scientist, who proposes building a solar power plant on the moon. The CatStronauts team -- Waffles, Major Meowser, Pom Pom, and Blanket -- are chosen for the high-stakes job. The feline team races through speeded-up training so they can save the world from darkness. But they start running into problems before they even make it to the moon. It's going to take ingenuity, resourcefulness, and teamwork to get the job done -- luckily, the CatStronauts have all that in spades.
","Author and illustrator Drew Brockington tests the theory that everything is better with cats -- and finds the answer is a cheerful yes with this charming series on a super-team of feline astronauts. In CatStronauts: Mission Moon, Brockington -- a proud Space Camp alum -- strikes upon a winning formula: Start with some solid science, add a sprinkle of history, and throw in plenty of puns. He works in cat jokes throughout the lively text and visual elements, from the floating tuna can progressing across each chapter page to the ball of yarn used to patch a broken part. The squat cats are full of personality, from the always-hungry Waffles to the no-nonsense Major Meowser. Science doesn't get cuter than this.","Parents need to know that CatStronauts: Mission Moon is the first in a graphic novel series by Drew Brockington that celebrates space science and teamwork.

The trouble is, he'll have to betray everyone he's ever cared about at Spy School.
","EVIL SPY SCHOOL carries on the series' tradition of combining jokes, smarts, and action, including typically cinematic fight scenes, explosions, and near-death experiences. Here, Ben Ripley is finally lured to the dark side, and fans of the earlier books will enjoy more of the same wit, suspense, and double-crossing of the earlier books. This book is a little less of a page-turner, as Ben spends much more time getting his bearings with SPYDER than charging into action as in previous books.
The violence is kept to a plot-moving but not-graphic minimum, and Gibbs get points for his commitment to gender balance: Here, two teen girls have extraordinary smarts and power, and one of them even gets to be evil. Mystery fans will enjoy a balanced, fun, suspenseful tale of outsmarting evil that doesn't shortchange anyone in the process.","Parents need to know that Evil Spy School is the third book in Stuart Gibbs' teen-spy series, following Spy Camp and Spy School. Here, Ben Ripley continues his mission as an undercover agent, only this time for the dark side. A kid-friendly distillation of the spy genre, it has gunfire, fistfights, explosions, and lots of double crossing. However, it often upends expectations to show that spying is decidedly less glamorous than it looks in the movies nd that problem solving and smarts are essential to survival. As the teen spies fight bad guys, crack codes, and uncover secret missions, their biggest mission is learning to trust one another and develop a sense of ethics against the lure of weapons, gadgets, and the promise of lots of money.

The Orphan of Awkward Falls,"Girl fights to save friend in creepy, comic horror tale.","When Josephine moves to Awkward Falls she is immediately intrigued by the gloomy town's mystery. Who is the striking couple in the old photograph she finds in her bedroom? What's going on in the mansion next door? Her curiosity leads her to Thaddeus, a cloned genius who lives on hot chocolate and candy while performing operations on dead pets to bring them back to life with spare animal parts. When a murderer escapes the town's Asylum for the Dangerously Insane, it's Thaddeus he's after, and it's up to Josephine to save him.
","Josephine is likable, and the contrast of Thaddeus's scientific intelligence with his naiveté is funny. The town of Awkward Falls, with its sauerkraut festival and oddball residents, is another source of humor. However, as is often the problem with comical novels of this sort, none of the characters seems real enough to be fully engaging, and the illustrations, meant to add interest and a layer of gothic horror, are often so dark that it's difficult to discern their details. Still, the mystery of Thaddeus' background is intriguing, and deliciously creepy events unfold at an exciting clip as Josephine puts the clues together. The combat between idiot murderer, strange monsters, and clever children is particularly satisfying. Though it's by no means innovative, the book may appeal to fans of Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events or Mayrose Wood's The Incorrigible Children of Ashton Place.","Parents need to know that this comic gothic tale features an insane murderer who eats his victims, laboratory-manufactured monsters, and adults who are not very smart.

Children of opposite tastes and temperaments, each can't understand -- and often resents -- the other.

One passage describes how, \""across the space between us, we made a fishing line with our eyes and each pulled the other to the center.\"" Star Boy accidentally sets his father's canoe adrift, and is so ashamed that he tries to turn himself into a rock. Their mother has a miscarriage. The island survives a hurricane, and when the people gather to celebrate, Star Boy is humiliated and Morning Girl defends him.

The Ultra Violets,Fast-paced girl-power confection made for superhero fans.,"It's the classic superhero story: Unsuspecting normal characters are accidently covered in goop from a science experiment, which alters their DNA forever. The difference is the four characters in THE ULTRA VIOLETS are girls and best friends in a city where the top scientists and business owners are women. And in this city, strange occurrences are par for the course. Iris, Cheri, Scarlet, and Opaline are struggling to come to terms with their new powers and the changing dynamics of their friendship.
","The Ultra Violets are like the Powerpuff Girls and Johnny Test in print --  sugary, high energy, and flirting with stereotypes. Readers may find that 300-plus pages of this episode is a tad too long, with the author filling valuable page space with endless manicure references for one character; multiple shows of brash, tom-boyish behavior from another; obsessive ""bouncing curls"" references for another, and never-ending moping from the one who is obviously going to turn to the dark side. Boiling the high energy role models down to nail polish, hair, ""pantsing"" and moping does them a disservice.
Readers will enjoy the fast-paced dialogue throughout, as well as the action toward the end, but may lose interest after struggling through the first chapters. The novel starts slow, and the addition of so many asides and narrator interjections is more frustrating than cool. Author Sophie Bell gets some things right in this girl-power romp by inserting lots of science and math. Lab and business geniuses are mostly women and no one blinks an eye. It's great to see so many female characters driving the tech/science side of the story and Bell does a great job breaking down complex concepts for readers (and some of the main characters). It'll be interesting to see if, in future books, the narrator (Bell) will allow the story to unfold without so much ""hip"" help.","Parents need to know that The Ultra Violets is an origin story of four regular girls who become superheroes that contains superficial female stereotypes (concern for hair and nails, for example), while at the same time showing women as leaders in science, technology, and business.

She's supposed to monitor a strange pod while the scientist in charge sleeps -- a scientist who's just been staring at it for 30 years. But, just Chevie's luck, the thing fires up on her watch, and a dead man and a teen boy with a knife materialize before her. A heavily armed FBI clean-up crew arrives, locks up the boy, and packs into the pod. The head scientist hastily gives Chevie instructions and a Timekey in case they don't return. Chevie is still scratching her head in utter confusion as the team disappears -- for good. Arriving in their place? A crazed assassin named Garrick who's looking for his reluctant apprentice, Riley. As Chevie escapes into the city with Riley, they're shocked that Garrick is barely a step behind them. How does he know all the FBI passcodes and the location of the most secure safehouse in London?

The teen characters are fantastic -- Chevie especially, with all the cheek she gives her superiors and her raw FBI rookie talent.
The anything-but-reluctant assassin Garrick is pure villain, but he's not at all two-dimensional; it's particularly gripping when Colfer switches to his warped point of view. And all the dangers Chevie and Riley race into slyly peel away another layer of mystery and intrigue; it's brilliantly meticulous storytelling at high speed. Sci-fi fans ages 13 to 113, don't miss this one.","Parents need to know that The Reluctant Assassin is the start of a series from the author of the bestselling Artemis Fowl series, so many kids will want to read it. The publishers recommend this exhilarating time travel read for ages 12 and up, but it seems  better fit for teens who've already digested many high-action, high-violence PG-13 movies. The villain isn't the reluctant assassin -- he's very willing to kill and does it often, both for hire and for himself, with some gory detail. His assistant, 14-year-old Riley, is the reluctant one. Riley and Native American Chevie (hooray for girls in sci-fi!) face nonstop danger, including kidnapping, fighting for their lives in an arena, poisoning, and more. There's lots of talk of how they were orphaned and a view of a London slum with despair and death all around. Both Riley and Chevie are resilient characters who use serious smarts to stay ahead of the killer on their tail.

Emma-Jean Lazarus Fell Out of a Tree,"Outcast finds her niche in smart, funny read.","Unlike many kids in junior high, Emma-Jean is happy... in a way. By becoming a combination of \""Super Not-Care Girl\"" and \""Nancy freakin' Drew,\"" Emma-Jean can closely observe the kids around her, even if she can't count any of them among her friends. One of Emma-Jean's best friends had been her father who died two years before. Since then, she has detached herself from the kids at school. That's why it's all the more surprising when Colleen Pomerantz, a girl in her class, confides in her. On a whim, Emma-Jean helps out Colleen, only to set in motion a chain of events that will mean Emma-Jean might have to leave the safety of her outsider status and join the chaos of Gladstone Middle School.
","If only we could all have a friend like Emma-Jean Lazarus. Or at least be like Emma-Jean, whom fellow student Colleen Pomerantz thinks of enviously as ""Super Not-Care Girl."" Emma-Jean doesn't care what the other kids think of her, and it's a good thing too, because everyone thinks she's really strange. When her mom suggests they look up ""strange"" in the dictionary, they find an apt definition of Emma-Jean: ""extraordinary, remarkable, singular."" All words, incidentally, that describe Lauren Tarshis' new book. Tarshis omits the hackneyed formula of the junior high melodrama where boys, crushes, and notes read aloud in class rule the day. Instead she addresses real problems kids face at school: friends who tend to bully or teachers who seem to have it ""in"" for you. Better still, the style of writing reflect's Emma-Jean's train of thought which is intelligent, logical, and humorous; the book is fun without ever feeling frivolous.","Parents need to know that this book addresses the death of a parent. Also, Emma-Jean writes several fake letters with no consequences.

"At the Bottom of the World: Jack and the Geniuses, Book 1","Bill Nye's passion, humor shine in science-rich mystery.","AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WORLD introduces 12-year-old Jack, who's overshadowed by his foster siblings Ava, 12, an engineering genius, and Matt, 15. When wealthy inventor Hank Witherspoon recruits the kids to help with his work, Jack ends up doing housekeeping and secretarial work. It's a welcome break to join Hank on a trip to Antarctica. Hank's friend Anna, a quirky biologist, is missing from the science base, and Jake is the first to realize she isn't just off on a research trip. Jake leads Ava and Matt on a mission to figure out where Anna might have gone and why -- and to try to rescue her before an approaching storm makes the effort hopeless.
","Bill Nye is beloved for getting kids excited about science, and he hits a bull's-eye again with this charming middle-grade debut -- with co-author Gregory Mone -- starring three smart, curious kids. At the Bottom of the World kicks off their Jack and the Geniuses series by deftly blending realistic tech thrills with human warmth and humor. The science is woven in seamlessly, deepening but never disrupting the story. In a nod to his TV show legacy, Nye adds fascinating notes at the end on the real-world inspirations for the devices featured in the story and Antarctica and its role in scientific research.
Despite his unlikely circumstances, Jack has a realistic 12-year-old voice. He's a self-deprecating kid who likes an occasional prank, but his understanding of other people is key to the team's success. Nick Iluzada's detail and full-page illustrations, done in shades of blue, add to the fun.","Parents need to know that Jack and the Geniuses at the Bottom of the World is the first in a middle schooler series by Bill Nye (Bill Nye the Science Guy) and Gregory Mone about a trio of bright, resourceful kids using science and engineering to solve mysteries.

The three children live on their own with supervision from a social worker after waging a legal fight for emancipation from the foster care system. There are strong hints about difficulties with their foster families -- Jack lived with foster parents who gambled excessively and taught him to steal cars.

Also, they highlight a dazzling array of fields, including science, medicine, literature, the arts, sports, politics, fashion, politics, the military, and more from a variety of countries, including a 16th-century pirate from Ireland, a 20th-century Formula One race car driver fom Italy,  19th-century spy from Colombia, and many queens and warriors. Sixty artists from around the world contributed the colorful portraits that accompany each story. ","This lively collection of stories about pioneering women and girls is sure to inspire and entertain both kids and adults. Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls encourages kids to think big, follow their dreams, never give up, and never listen to anyone who says you can't achieve something because you're female. It's great as a read-aloud for boys and girls or independent reading for older kids and offers a wonderful introduction to the many possible career paths open to all. A sobering message in the preface reminds readers how much these extraordinary women struggled for recognition and respect: ""No matter the importance of their discoveries, the audacity of their adventures, the width of their genius -- they were constantly belittled, forgotten, in some cases erased from history. It is important that girls understand the obstacles that lie in front of them. It is just as important that they know these obstacles are not insurmountable.""","Parents need to know that Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls is a collection of 100 one-page stories about women throughout history who broke barriers and achieved great things.

And some are lesser known (at least in America), such as Matilde Montoya, Mexico's first female doctor, and Sonita Alizadeh, a 20-year-old rapper from Afghanistan who refused to be sold into marriage and whose song ""Brides for Sale"" went viral on YouTube. One story features a transgender American girl who broke barriers at her elementary school.

The Finisher,"Hunger Games, Potter fans will enjoy exciting fantasy.","Vega Jane, 14, lives in the village of Wormwood, and, as everyone knows, Wormwood is all there is. Everyone also knows that Wormwood is surrounded by a terrifying wilderness called the Quag, home to every horrific beast imaginable (and more that aren't). When one of her coworkers disappears into the Quag, Vega starts to wonder if there might not be more to the world beyond. And the more she starts to question the ruling Council's policies and wisdom, the more determined she becomes to find out the truth for herself by escaping Wormwood and trying to cross the Quag herself -- that is, if she can survive Duelum, where she'll have to fight to the finish against Wormwood's biggest, strongest warriors, who are capable of killing with one blow.
","Author David Baldacci's young adult debut is a winner. It's an exciting fantasy that combines elements of the Hunger Games-style dystopia with Harry Potter-type magic in a unique, engaging world. Vega Jane is a compelling action heroine who's loyal and cares deeply about family and friends. A large cast of colorful and well-developed characters round out Vega's world, which is richly imagined and vividly realized.

The novel's set in a fantasy world with frequent peril from scary monsters, and blood is mentioned a lot without being described in detail. Blows and injuries from tournament fistfighting duels are described in some detail. There are two or three quick kisses mentioned briefly, not too yucky for younger tweens.

Double Bass Blues,Gorgeous story of a boy's excellence and the power of music.,"In DOUBLE BASS BLUES, Nic shines as young musician with visible talent: eyes closed, head leaned into the neck of his double bass, slight smile on his lips as he plays. After his fellow orchestra members congratulate him for an ""epic solo"" during practice, he heads off, massive bass bag slung over his shoulder, for a long commute from his suburban school into the city. A threatening dog, bullies, plunking rain, whooshing windshield wipers, and other sounds and stressors might be enough to ruin any other kid's glow, but not for Nic. They all get channeled into his art t his final destination, where he finds refuge in family, and, again, music.
","This powerful book beautifully honors determination, making music, and Black boyhood. Nic's journey in Double Bass Blues is thrilling to watch unfold. As he walks, buses, and walks again to get into the city, Nic gracefully shrugs off bullies, keeps the sounds of the rain and windshield wipers in his head, and walks up stairway after stairway with that heavy bass. His arrival in the arms of his granddaddy is a long sigh of relief, and the realization that Nic is not the first musician in his bloodline to a refuge built of family, music and love.
With only about 30 words and 13 lines of dialogue, Rudy Gutierrez's stunning art does a lot of the story's heavy lifting. His swooping curved lines and sharp jagged edges evoke the different moods of Nic's journey. And the way Nic's face and hair coloring changes slightly from spread to spread captures the beauty of Blackness. This book is bursting with music, dedication, the importance of family, and Black excellence. Young readers will be able to connect on one or more levels, but this wonderful boy with his beloved bass is bound to steal the hearts of all. Don't miss this book; it's a keeper.","Parents need to know that Andrea J. Loney's Double Bass Blues, illustrated by Rudy Gutierrez, won a 2020 Caldecott Honor.

Nic, a talented young double bass player has a long, rough, commute from his suburban school, where he's admired for his musicianship, back into the city, where he lives and his granddaddy waits. Nic's determination, grace, and, ultimately, joy, as expressed in the immersive art, will engage readers of all ages. Nic's classmates are racially and gender diverse, though the SUVs lined up on the road outside school suggests a lack of economic diversity. Background characters on his journey home are also a mixed crowd, while Nic, his grandfather, and the grandfather's friends are all Black. The language is very mild, with some teasing, and a bully calls Nic a ""chump."" With its expansive pictures, accessible text, and affirming messages, this is a book young kids will enjoy.

Stoner & Spaz,"Edgy, sardonic book is OK for mature readers.","Ben, a teen with cerebral palsy and an obsession with movies, has been properly brought up by his prim, overprotective, but caring grandmother. Colleen, his classmate, is a drug addict and dealer who sleeps around. Together they are ''Stoner & Spaz''  When at their first meeting Colleen vomits down the side of Ben's grandmother's car, their unlikely friendship doesn't seem destined to last. But each treats the other as a real human being, something neither has experienced before. And, since Colleen's jock boyfriend isn't threatened by Ben and is even, in his own fatheaded way, kind to him, they begin spending a lot of time together, despite Grandmother's disapproval. Colleen makes Ben begin to see how he's been wasting his life holding himself aloof from everyone out of self-pity. And Ben helps Colleen begin to make her way out of her haze of drugs, at least temporarily.
","Ben tells the story, and his sardonic view of teen life, and of himself, is mostly amusing and clever, and the part of his humor that is self-pitying is knocked flat by Colleen's wicked directness. Though it's Ben's voice and story, the book is really about Colleen, a charming, if disgusting, junkie who's too smart to be behaving this stupidly.
Poet and novelist Ron Koertge's forte is tight, witty dialogue, and he uses it to great effect here. Conversations between Ben and Colleen, his grandmother, his neighbor, and his classmates sparkle with sharp patter reminiscent of '40s movies. This brief, fast-moving, funny story, with doses of sex, swearing, and drugs, will keep even reluctant teen readers turning the pages.","Parents need to know that one main character in this book uses drugs and wonders why they're illegal. In the end she goes back to using drugs. There is some gritty language as well as references to masturbation, oral sex, molestation, homosexuality, and a (not graphic) sex scene. But teen readers will likely take something else away:  Through a unique friendship, Colleen makes Ben begin to see how he's been wasting his life holding
himself aloof from everyone out of self-pity. And Ben helps Colleen
begin to make her way out of her haze of drugs, at least temporarily.  They become more complex than their
derogatory monikers -- and Ben in particular matures and is able to see himself in a new light.

A Different Pond,Exquisitely tender family story of Vietnamese refugees.,"In A DIFFERENT POND, a young, unnamed boy gets up long before dawn to go fishing with his father, to catch dinner for their Vietnamese refugee family before the dad goes off to his second job. They drive to a pond where they have to climb over a highway barrier and walk past a ""No Trespassing"" sign. They light a small campfire, and while fishing, the dad shares bologna sandwiches he made, and stories about the Vietnam war. When they've caught two crappies, they drive home, and the boy is left in the care of his older siblings for the day, as the dad and mom leave for work.
","This tender, masterful family story about a hardworking refugee dad and his son focuses on a simple outing that speaks volumes about their lives and the strong ties that bind them. In A Different Pond, author Bao Phi chooses just the right sensory detail to bring the reader into the experience. As they drive before the sun comes up, ""Dad turns on the heater,"" and when they finish fishing, they wash their hands ""with a small nub of green and white soap."" Phi also has a poet's ear for language. The minnows they buy for bait ""swim like silver arrows in my hands."" And the boy looks up ""to see faint stars like freckles."" Phi references Vietnam and the war, giving the reader a glimpse without weighing down the story. ""Dad tells me about the war, but only sometimes. He and his brother fought side by side. One day, his brother didn't come home.""
Thi Bui's evocative illustrations have a look a bit like graphic novel art. The body language of the dad and boy clearly conveys the affection they share, and Bui's midnight blue night scenes evoke the early hour. She also finds ways to show us that the neighborhood is diverse -- there's a sign in Spanish for a restaurant -- and also that it's somewhat gritty -- they pass a homeless man with his belongings piled high in a shopping cart. This tale is so artfully rendered in text and art, readers will be very glad they came along on this intimate family fishing trip.","Parents need to know that A Different Pond won  2018 Caldecott Honor. It's written by spoken-word poet Bao Phi, whose family came to the United States as Vietnamese refugees and settled in Minneapolis, and illustrated by Thi Bui, also born in Vietnam.

A boy gets up long before dawn to fish with his father so that they can catch dinner for the family before the dad leaves to work his second, weekend job. The beauty is in the subtle, evocative detail. This is a moving father-son story as well as an immigrant/refugee story, and a shining example of picture books at their best.

Worse, Mana returns home to find the place trashed and her mother missing. A mysterious government agent claims to be her frumpy mom's partner in alien hunting and tells Mana that he's searching for a piece of technology that might either save the world or destroy it. To navigate the trail of secrets surrounding her family, Mana must rely on her own developing instincts, her new ability to jump to incredible heights, and the support of her best friend, Lyle, a boy for whom she's beginning to have romantic feelings.
","Author Carrie Jones finds an accessibly breezy tone for her narration and concocts a sci-fi adventure that offers plenty of fun, even if its plot is not particularly groundbreaking. Mixing comedy and action is a delicate balance, and this combination of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Men in Black expertly straddles genres. Main character Mana develops her sense of self-reliance as she searches for her kidnapped mother, and her transition from coddled cheerleader to tough alien-hunter is fun to witness.
The romantic subplot is handled with aplomb, even if the clever banter seems  little forced at times.

BE DIFFERENT, BE BRAVE, AND BE YOU begins with a direct address from kid Sonia, telling readers that she and her friends are planting a garden. She talks about all the different plants that make a garden special, relates the garden to differences between kids, and tells readers that when they're curious about someone else, it’s OK to ask them questions. Sonia then introduces her difference/condition (diabetes), and then 11 other kids introduce their own unique ""powers"" -- from courage to self-calming practices to knowing almost everything about one topic. Each character contributes to the garden project in a unique way that plays to their strengths. The ending concludes on an empowering note.

Even kids who aren't living with any of the challenges that are covered will be able to connect to the characters’ feelings and experiences.
And the artwork is gorgeous -- vibrant, saturated colors portray detailed scenes in a vast garden and impart a sense of joy, while the kids of various ethnicities, genders, and abilities happily contribute to their joint project. Though the garden as a symbol for the beauty in human differences might go over younger kids’ heads, older readers will have no problem identifying this main theme. The question at the end of each two-spread page helps kids stay engaged with both the book (and any adults reading with them).

After she rescues a baby from a life as an abused beggar, and sneaks off to hear Gandhi speak, her father sends her off to England to live with spinster aunts and attend a \""proper\"" school. But the change of scenery doesn't chasten her, and she quickly sparks a domestic rebellion in her own family.
","In SMALL ACTS OF AMAZING COURAGE, Gloria Whelan provides informative look at England and India after World War I, capturing an important period in the history of both countries. Rosalind is a perfect character for telling that larger story, as she is dealing with her own ideas about independence at home.
Though often charming, the characters surrounding Rosalind remain two-dimensional. The plot makes a predictable march and the ending leaves the thorniest issues unresolved. There's some lovely writing, and readers will be impressed by Rosalind's perceptive reflections near the end of her story -- but this is mostly a history lesson dressed up in a coming-of-age tale. Nevertheless,it's likely to entice young readers to seek out more on Gandhi and the end of colonial authority in India.","Parents need to know that Small Acts of Amazing Courage is a historical novel that unflinchingly portrays racist and classist attitudes in British India in the early 1900s -- both British disregard for the dignity of Indians, and upper-caste Indian treatment of lower-caste people. There's also a strong message about thinking for yourself, and not accepting unjust authority. This is an intriguing entry into what India was like in the aftermath of World War I, and a primer on Gandhi and India's struggle to be free of British rule. There's little direct violence, but there are references to the 1919 massacre at Amritsar, Indian rebels being tied to British cannons and ""blown to bits,"" and children deliberately deformed and put to work as beggars.

"Half Lost: The Half Bad Trilogy, Book 3",Gory and too-quick ending for riveting witch series.,"White witches are in an all-out war with the Alliance -- black witches, half-codes, and some white witch sympathizers -- and they need Nathan now more ever. But Nathan is in mourning after his father is killed and takes it out on the white witch Hunters looking for Alliance camps. He's killed dozens of Hunters looking for his old love, Annalise, the girl responsible for his father's death. And Nathan works alone, with the powers he gained by eating his dying father's heart -- invisibility, for one. But when the Alliance camp is breached, his friend Gabriel convinces him to do more than kill Hunters on his own -- the Alliance has a plan to take the white witch government down, and they can't do it without his help.
","This intense and violent trilogy actually ends poignantly -- get your tissues -- and it ends way too quickly. Most fantasy finales that teens are used to are gargantuan tomes that drag out every last battle scene and conflict and wrap everything up with another 100 pages -- Cassandra Clare's books immediately come to mind. But the whole Half Bad Trilogy could have always been more grandiose, with more of Annalise, more of Gabriel, and especially more time with the spiritual guide figure in HALF LOST, the witch Ledger. She or he -- they never say -- offers to train Nathan in his many gifts, and he refuses to do more than battle him or her once, then says goodbye. Ledger's consideration of whether Nathan could be the one to wield so much power also seems rushed. And the climactic battle cuts off abruptly with little bits of the aftermath filled in months later -- and after all that buildup.  Author Sally Green could have always given readers more. But the fact that many will be hungry for it means that she's created memorable and compelling characters in a unique, captivating witch world.","Parents need to know that Sally Green's Half Lost is the end of a fantasy trilogy about witches that the publisher is marketing to age 12 and up. However, the amount of violence here and the overall edginess of the content make it pretty consistent with books most publishers aim toward the more mature YA crowd -- high schoolers, not middle schoolers. This particular brand of witch culture is especially violent overall. Add in an all-out war between white and black witches, and the body count here is high. Gory moments are often caused by the main character, Nathan, whose head we're in for most of the book. He gets his finger sliced off on purpose; he slices off thumbs and an ear; he gets ""hot, slippery guts"" spilled on him when he slices open an enemy; and he slits many throats. Also, there's a near death from a magic bullet wound where poison eats away at insides. Bombs and grenades explode, magic lightning shoots out of fingers and stuns many, and some are shot and killed with bullets. Expect two sad deaths of characters close to Nathan. Sexual content is also mature, with kissing, nakedness, and lovemaking between two male characters, though nothing is described beyond that. Nathan throws ""f--k"" around quite a bit and often ""s--t."" He's 17 and smokes twice. The mature content isn't only meant to shock; the main character must come to grips with how the violence he's committed has changed him.

Piper,"Dark, violent retelling of creepy legend has gorgeous art.","Maggie, a deaf outcast in a small -- and small-minded -- village dreams of being understood and loved in PIPER. She's smitten with the mysterious pipe-playing stranger who says he can rid the villagers of their rat problem. Village leaders agree to a deal but regard his entitled behavior with distrust. Maggie, used to being treated callously, warms to his attention but is slow to recognize his fixation on power and vengeful justice. By the time the piper kills the rats, village leaders complain the deal is unfair. The piper, angered, kidnaps their children. Maggie persuades him to tell her where to find the children but refuses to join him. The furious villagers attack the Piper, leading to a horrifying tragedy.
","The story of the Pied Piper gets a fascinating -- and sinister -- treatment in this lush graphic novel exploring themes of bullying, fairness, justice, and abusive relationships. Author Jay Asher teams up with Jessica Freeburg for this complex reimagining of the familiar legend. It's plenty creepy, and readers willing to lean into the discomfort will find an unnerving portrayal of a pathologically abusive man: The piper homes in on an isolated, vulnerable woman and charms her even as he seeks to control her. Maggie evolves from victim to hero, recognizing him as a master manipulator and standing up for kindness and compassion despite her trauma.
An introductory note on what we know -- and don't know -- about what really happened in Hamelin sets a chilling stage for what's to come. And Jeff Stokely's illustrations give the story its strange, alluring mystery with rich colors, expressive faces, and spot-on pacing.
	 ","Parents need to know that Piper is a graphic novel that adds more grim layers to the already creepy legend of the Pied Piper, said to have spirited away a town's children when he wasn't paid for ridding them of rats. The piper in this version by Jay Asher (Thirteen Reasons Why) and Jessica Freeburg is vengeful and violent, killing those who cross him and trying to manipulate others to suit his needs. The villagers, for the most part, are coarse, unkind, and suspicious, and sometimes deceitful. Many bully Maggie, mocking her deafness, and she makes up fantastic stories in which they suffer terrible consequences. It's an unsettling story, but it's full of thought-provoking material on authentic relationships, healing from trauma, and choosing how you want to view the world.

The Secret Subway,Spectacular strange-but-true tale of first New York subway.,"As the streets of New York City grew dangerously congested in the 1860s, Alfred Ely Beach thought he'd found a solution: an underground pneumatic tube to whisk people through the city. Getting the OK for such a project would be difficult in the city run by Boss Tweed, however. So Beach officially sought permission to build a small mail tube, but secretly he built a short tunnel and rail car, powered by a fan, to carry passengers. He hoped it would be the basis for a new transit system, but opposition from politicians and business owners killed his dream. His underground station was forgotten for years, until it was unearthed during excavation for the modern-day subway.
","The story of how Alfred Beach tried to build an early subway for New York City is fascinatingly recounted for the picture-book set with vivid, lively language and jaw-dropping artwork. THE SECRET SUBWAY is a quirky bit of history -- how many books aimed at preschoolers talk about Boss Tweed? -- and Shana Corey does an admirable job explaining the obstacles Beach faced in an accessible, engaging way.
The extraordinary artwork by Red Nose Studio (aka Chris Sickels) merits a full pictorial explainer on the inside of the book jacket. Resembling stills from an animated film, they're composed of clay model figures, cardboard collage backgrounds, hand-drawn accents, and meticulously crafted details. The innovative themes may prompt readers to start building their own dioramas.","Parents need to know that The Secret Subway chronicles New York's first subway, which was built secretly in an attempt to get around the corruption of Tammany Hall -- and forgotten for years until construction of the subway system we know today got started. While the book does a solid job explaining the political challenges in broad brushstrokes, parents may need to explain a little more to this young audience about Boss Tweed and political machines and why the subway's inventor resorted to deception to work on his project. The history is fascinating, and astonishing artwork using clay model figures and meticulously designed scenes brings this curious, well-told story to life.

Sunrise Over Fallujah,"Realistic, nonpolitical view of the war in Iraq.","Robin, a young man from Harlem (and nephew to Richie, the soldier from the author's Fallen Angels), enlists in the army after 9/11, much to his father's angry disapproval. He is sent to Iraq as part of a Civilian Affairs unit, which is supposed to follow the fighting troops and help win the hearts and minds of the Iraqi people. But in the confusion of this difficult situation, Robin finds himself in combat as often as in talks.
","So far there have been very few books for young adults about this ongoing conflict, but this is one that does the job admirably. Writing about the reality of a current conflict for children, or even young adults, is of necessity a balancing act -- how much to show, how far to go, in accurate depictions of horrific events. Veteran author Walter Dean Myers walks that fine line about as perfectly as it can be done. He doesn't pull his punches, but neither does he go overboard. He has just enough violence and swearing to keep it realistic without wallowing in them, and thereby gives about as accurate a picture of the fog of war in this particularly foggy war as one can give to children.
	He does this, in part, by keeping some emotional distance between the readers and the characters. The book is moving, but the reader never gets to know the characters well enough to be truly shattered by the things that happen to them. Again, a balance -- there's just enough emotional involvement, but not too much. And he shows the boredom and the humor that are just as much a part of army life as violence and death, even in a war zone.
 From the Book:
	I didn't know if I had the same will to win as the guy from the 3rd. What I did know was that I wanted to do my part. The officers let us sit around and talk up the war and I thought that they did it on purpose. It was like being in a locker room before the big game.
	""I seen a 240 take a guy's leg off from a hundred yards,"" a big-headed corporal said. ""The whole leg came off and the sucker was just laying on the ground, looking at his leg as he died.""
	I felt a little sick.","Parents need to know that this is a book about the realities of the Iraq war. It takes no political positions, and though the violence and swearing are considerably less than they might have been, given the subject, there is still a bit of swearing and some gruesome descriptions of violence -- heads exploding and pieces of flesh. Also, a female soldier is nearly raped.

Monster,Provocative book about teen on trial for murder.,"Steve's in jail, on trial for murder. He's young, he's terrified, and he's black. He's sure no one will believe him. Does Steve even believe in himself? You decide when you read this fast-moving book written like a movie script. The courtroom mystery hits home with enough drama and realism to attract even reluctant readers.
 ","The suspense and drama keep reluctant readers turning the pages, while more advanced readers will respond to the issues raised. Walter Dean Myers writes about human beings who make their own choices and react to their own circumstances -- even the minor characters have enough individuality to ring true -- and, as a result, teen readers care about them. They want Steve to be found not guilty, even as they try to figure out if Steve really is guilty. Steve's feelings about himself, his terror of jail, and his reaction to the epithet ""monster,"" leave the reader guessing.
The format of this taut story regulates the pacing. Edge-of-the-seat courtroom scenes written entirely in dialogue wind the reader up, then thoughtful journal entries allow readers to catch their breaths. Readers can feel Steve's terror and confusion, and will ponder Myers' point about how the road from innocence to trouble is taken in small, almost invisible steps, each involving a ""lack of positive moral decision.""","Parents need to know that this book is about a teen on trial for murder. While part of the story is told as a movie script, it employs highly realistic writing, with both poor and proper grammar used appropriately for each character. Grainy photographs contribute to the realistic atmosphere. There is some gritty material: characters are beaten up, the rape of inmates is implied, and Steve is terrified of being sent to prison. The high drama in this dialogue-driven story will appeal to even reluctant readers. And teens will appreciate debating whether Steve's guilty or not, and related issues, such as the fairness of our judicial system.

"""Why Is This Night Different from All Other Nights?"": All the Wrong Questions, Book 4","Friends, villain clash on speeding train in gripping finale.","Young apprentice investigator Lemony Snicket is determined to unmask the evil Hangfire, put an end to his murderous deeds, and save the town of Stain'd-by-the Sea once and for all -- but time is running out: He learns that Hangfire will be on a train out of town and vows to be on it (even though he has no money to buy a ticket) to confront him and solve the mystery of the Bombinating Beast. His associates and many of the town's denizens from the first three books end up on the train, too, including his ditsy chaperone; bumbling police officers Mimi and Harvey Mitchum and their rotten son, Stew; librarian Dashiell Qwerty; nd the mysterious Ellington Feint. Can Snicket figure out who connects to Hangfire and end the villain's reign of terror before the train reaches the city? And will he ever see his sister, Kit, again? ","Like a nail-biting Agatha Christie mystery, this volume gathers all the suspects, schemers, and investigators in one place -- a speeding train -- to expose the murderer. Readers finally learn who  Hangfire is, how the various plot threads connect, and see what Snicket is really made of. Two violent deaths make this installment darker and heavier than the others, adding a level of moral ambiguity to both the story and the Snicket character that kids may not be expecting. It's not all dazzling wordplay, sly humor, and savvy crime-solving this time; real life-and-death choices get made.
The writing, as always, is the real star, with fun and clever descriptions (""her hair lay sprawled on the pillow like a mop had jumped off the roof"") as well as poignant expressions of self-doubt and regret (""I walked amongst them like a shadow, casting darkness over everyone I knew""). No word yet on whether young Snicket will be back to solve another mystery, but some situations remain unresolved, and Snicket does allow that ""there was still work to be done,"" giving fans hope for more.","Parents need to know that Lemony Snicket's ""Why Is This Night Different from All Other Nights?"" is the fourth and final book in the All the Wrong Questions noir mystery series set in the strange, faded town of Stain'd-by-the Sea and starring the ""almost 13-year-old"" Snicket. Readers finally find out who Hangfire is and how characters and plot threads from books 1 through 3 connect. It's a satisfying, if shocking in some ways, conclusion that will surely leave readers wanting more young-Snicket mysteries. There are two violent deaths: One murder occurs offstage, but characters find the body marked by a bloody stain; the other death happens in a gripping, action-packed scene that's described, but there's no blood. And there's a scene where a kid appears to have been killed but isn't dead. A scary, monstrous creature gets loose, and passengers are shaken up when train cars derail.

The Schwa Was Here,Going unnoticed isn't always fun.,"Calvin Schwa is one of those kids who doesn't get noticed, even when he's standing in the middle of the boy's bathroom singing ""God Bless America"" while wearing an orange sombrero and a cat costume. When Antsy Bonano does finally notice him, the decide to test the ""Schwa Effect,"" then to make some money from it. They go one dare too far, however, and end up doing penance to a crabby, rich old man with a beautiful blind granddaughter.
Fun aside, though, not being noticed can be tough, especially for the Schwa, whose mother disappeared when he was five and whose father seems to be out in space most of the time. As Antsy learns more about the Schwa's miserable life, he's determined to be the one who notices. But the Schwa has something more dramatic in mind.
","Neal Shusterman has a unique imagination, which can make his books hard to describe. This one skirts the edge of fantasy, sometimes perhaps sticking a toe over the line. The form is a sort-of legend, reminiscent of Maniac Magee, but the voice is a not-totally-consistent but often wicked Brooklyn smart-alec. The combination is fluidly readable, unpredictable, and poignantly funny.
The chapter titles give a pretty good idea of the mood of the book: ""Manny Bullpucky Gets his Sorry Butt Hurled off the Marine Park Bridge,"" ""Which is Worse: Getting Mauled by a Pack of Dogs or Getting Your Brains Bashed out by a Steel Poker?"" and so on. But there's also a lot to think about and talk about here, most notably the whole Schwa Effect -- it may be a comic exaggeration, but it's all too real for many tweens.","Parents need to know that this is a borderline-fantasy take on a real problem: Young adolescents who feel invisible, unnoticed.

A Couple of Boys Have the Best Week Ever,Giggles abound in friendship-focused read-aloud.,"James and Eamon experience a week of pure bliss while visiting Eamon's grandparents.
","The book is full of moments that kids will appreciate s James and Eamon spend a week together with Eamon's grandparents. They stuff themselves with banana waffles, play lots of video games, and wrestle. In other words, the title is no lie (though the outdoorsy-vacation look of the book's cover is a little deceiving). Especially kids who have been lovingly spoiled by grandparents will love details from the coffee ice-cream icebergs with hard chocolate sauce to the grandparents' willingness to let James and Eamon set the schedule, even if it means a day full of video games instead of the aquarium trip grandpa suggests.
Balloon dialog humorously belies some of the text, making for some funny juxtapositions.

"Her Dark Curiosity: The Madman's Daughter, Book 2",Horror-heavy sequel adds Jekyll and Hyde homage.,"After Juliet is jilted by Montgomery and set adrift in the Pacific, she starts her life afresh in London as the charge of Professor Von Stein, an old colleague of Juliet's father, the very one who supposedly turned Dr. Moreau in for his unethical animal experimentation. But though Juliet is a proper Victorian lady out in society again, she's still a girl with a big secret: The animal organs that saved her life as a baby are failing, and the serum she's taken her whole life now barely keeps the shaking and fainting spells at bay. So she finds a low-rent apartment, buys a chemistry set and fresh animal organs from the market, and starts to work on fixing the serum. She's so caught up in her work that it isn't until she's at the butcher one day that she sees her bloody organs wrapped in an even bloodier newspaper story: A serial killer is on the loose in London. The Wolf of Whitechapel, they call him. Not only does the Wolf claw his victims to death in a way Juliet remembers vividly, she also knows the names of the victims. Each had wronged her in some way. Was Juliet really the only one who escaped the island?
","What a great set-up: Juliet's back in London, but she's not alone; and Edward's not alone in his body -- Mr. Jekyll is what he calls himself in polite society. Ha. Even better, absolutely no one is who he or she seems to be, except probably Juliet's guardian and her friend Lucy.
The first two-thirds of HER DARK CURIOSITY keep the surprises coming. The last third -- well, except for a rousing, gory climax, there's a lot weighing it down. Too much talk about experiments and codes that sound pretty far-fetched; too much of Juliet brooding, feeling guilty about her love life, and hating her darker nature; and too much detail about the secret, sinister organization she's fighting against. And to end it, there's a pretty hasty set-up for the third book, which seems like a big departure from the first two. ","Parents need to know that Her Dark Curiosity, the sequel to The Madman's Daughter, is part of a horror-heavy sci-fi series. Continuing some of Book 1's themes of animal-human experimentation based on the H.G. Wells classic The Island of Doctor Moreau, it adds an homage to the Robert Louis Stevenson novella Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Now a serial killer -- one of Juliet's father's creations -- is rampaging through the city of London. He claws his victims to death; Juliet visits a morgue secretly for a closer look at the damage. The climax is gorier than the first book's, with wild animals ripping apart some humans, gunshots fired, and one man burning alive. So, yes, this is heavy on the horror like the first novel is. Also similar to the first, this has compelling themes of ethics in science. For example, when does scientific discovery cross a line? Characters drink and smoke, with mentions of hard liquor; Juliet, a teen, seems to stick to wine with dinner. The sexual content is more mature than it is in Book 1: Juliet sleeps with one suitor, though it's barely described, and kisses another before falling asleep with him.

All of This Is True,Writer uses teens' secrets for stories in riveting thriller.,"In ALL OF THIS IS TRUE, four teens can't believe their luck when they are befriended by a YA author they idolize. That initial excitement turns to sorrow, anger, and dread when their lives unravel and the relationship turns out not to be all that it seems. The four teens -- Miri, Soleil, Penny, and Jonah -- are shallow, privileged students at an exclusive prep school on Long Island. Being on top socially matters to them, so they feed on the attention and associated fame from being in author Fatima Ro's inner circle. They eat up Ro's advice on living an authentic life and adopt her cult-like terminology, but when they put her advice into practice, deeps secrets are exposed and lives are shattered. The teens are left wondering whether they were Ro's pawns all along and can't be sure of what was true and what was a lie.
","This sharp, riveting social drama and psychosocial thriller is impossible to put down. Author Lygia Day Peñaflor goes meta with All of This Is True, spinning a YA story about a YA author who mines the lives of teens for her subject matter. The novel starts out feeling like fluff, but as it progresses it delves into interesting issues around teen social structures, mob mentality, social media, and who stories belong to. Because of the shallowness of their lives, Miri, Soleil, Penny, and Jonah are so thrilled by the friendship and reflected fame of being close to famous author Fatima Ro that they don't question why an adult would want to be their friend, or the downsides of exposing their entire lives to her. The subject resonates in this over-sharing era of lifestyle bloggers, influencers, and Instagram fame. The thriller aspect comes from the creepiness of Fatima's cult-like hold over the teens and her new-age terminology that they weave into their lives, such as ""inside/out"" for total transparency and ""precious truths"" for their deepest thoughts.
The format of the book is interesting but bogs it down at the outset. Between the two television interviews, the published journal excerpts, and passages from two novels, there's a lot to keep track of. But it falls into place about one-third of the way into the story.","Parents need to know that All of This Is True is about the manipulative relationship between four teens and the YA author they idolize. The story is part social drama, part psychological thriller. Flattered to be befriended by a novelist whose work they love, the shallow, status-conscious teens eat up the attention she shines on them, to disastrous consequences. The story is set in a wealthy  community on New York's Long Island, where the teens attend an exclusive private school. Cliques, privilege, elitism, and social-media fame all factor into the story. Characters make some bad decisions, though there's no drinking or drug use in the book. Characters swear infrequently, including ""s--t,"" ""f--k,"" and ""bitch."" Issues of honesty, social status, cliques, and idol worship provide interesting discussion topics.

Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever,Snowstorm tale lacks some punch but stays funny in 6th book.,"It's November, and Greg is already worried about making Santa's naughty list. To get info directly back to St. Nick, Greg's mom enlists the help of an elf doll that she calls Santa's Scout. That doesn't stop the mischievous misadventures, though, as Greg ices over someone's driveway (thinking a hose would be faster than shoveling) to make money to feed and clothe his online pet, pretends to use his mom's exercise game (but just sits and presses the buttons instead), and accidentally defaces school property with posters that stain the walls (and there's no way he's owning up to that). But when a blizzard strands Dad comfortably at a hotel and the rest of the family is stuck with limited food and no electricity, that's when the Christmas holidays really get interesting.
","Fans of the Wimpy Kid series could definitely do worse than having CABIN FEVER handy during cold winter weather. Greg's still up to no good in his own cluelessly funny way. Seeing how his family handles being stranded in a snowstorm is the highlight of the book. On the other hand, flashbacks about Greg's strange doll and the president's physical fitness test aren't as engaging and are too big a departure from the main story.
	As always, there are reminders that being a kid is so different today. Parents reading along will laugh about the sad state of Greg's playground (all the toys are removed for ""safety reasons""), the kids sneaking energy drinks when the school soda machine is removed, and that Greg gets rewarded with cybercash for watching his online pet watch commercials. While the later volumes in this series lack a little punch compared with the early ones, there's still plenty to laugh at and discuss with young readers.","Parents need to know that the sixth installment in the extremely popular Wimpy Kid series is the mildest yet. There's almost no violence except for a few barely bullied kids. And a couple of cartoons show Greg in the bathroom with his underwear on. Parents will probably be more concerned with Greg's behavior. As usual, he's not owning up to his mistakes, but he usually pays the price in excessive worry and/or (fair) punishment from his parents or the school. Parents may like the jabs at sites like Webkinz that get kids to hit their parents up for money -- a worthy topic of discussion -- and the safety restrictions at school that are so excessive that all of the playground equipment is removed.

"The Last of August: Charlotte Holmes, Book 2","Art heists, tortured romance in Holmes-Watson teen tale.","THE END OF AUGUST finds 16-year-old Jamie Watson spending a thrilling but uneasy Christmas holiday, after surviving the events of Book 1. It starts at the Sussex home of Charlotte Holmes' brilliant, dysfunctional family, but the teens are soon dashing off to sleazy quarters, dens of espionage, and dubious art scenes in Berlin and Prague. Jamie (who narrates most of the story) and Charlotte struggle with their intense, complicated relationship. Meanwhile, Charlotte's favorite uncle (and Jamie's dad's onetime best friend), who's been investigating art forgery, suddenly disappears, and she's convinced the Moriartys are, once again, to blame. Travel, intrigue, mayhem, deceit, and disguise soon follow -- complicated by the reappearance of August Moriarty, Charlotte's onetime tutor, whose life took a disastrous turn after she developed a crush on him.
","Brittany Cavallaro's second entry in the Charlotte Holmes trilogy is a dark, complicated story that keeps the pages turning right up to the shocking conclusion. Dysfunctional families, blood feuds, art forgery, murder -- these are only  few of the challenges facing 16-year-old Jamie Watson and Charlotte Holmes as they sort out their strong bond and loads of baggage. As Jamie navigates a world in which he's fascinated, thrilled, and completely out of his depth, and Charlotte follows an internal compass known only to her, there's plenty of angst about their relationship, lots of romantic tension, nd deadly situations a-go-go.
There are also great travel vignettes describing the local scenes, architecture, and culture in Berlin and Prague. Some comical interludes involving elaborate disguises, art auctions, and school friends lighten the mood.","Parents need to know that The Last of August, Brittany Cavallaro's follow-up to A Study in Charlotte, plunges teen characters Charlotte Holmes (descendant of Sherlock) and Jamie Watson (descendant of Doctor) into a dark world of murder, technology, international intrigue, and art forgery, as well as the multigenerational blood feud between the Holmeses and the Moriartys. It's all, supposedly, in aid of finding Charlotte's favorite uncle, who's suddenly disappeared, but there's always good reason to suspect deceit and subterfuge on many fronts. The latest of their families to have a life-changing if tortured connection, the two 16-year-olds have a strong bond that they're constantly questioning as events unfold and they try to do the right thing -- according to their own reckoning. Murder's all in a day's work for several adult characters, and the teens are, at various times, kidnapped, imprisoned, drugged, and beaten. One adult character is being poisoned by another; another has disappeared; and nother is shot to death. There's a lot of romantic tension and snarky banter about people's sex lives, gay and straight, but no explicit detail. Expect some swearing (including ""f--k"" and ""s--t""). But, as the story wends its way to a shocking conclusion that sets up the trilogy's final volume, dark deeds and dark forces are, overwhelmingly, everywhere.

The book quickly veers into more imaginative territory as he suggests she pack something to shoo off the ""bedtime beasties."" After that she must pack her dog to fend off the beasties, a light to see with, and eventually, the house and her father. The task proves to be so tiring that she ends up falling asleep. It's so fun that she asks her dad if she can ""run away again tomorrow.""
","This funny, sweet bedtime picture book has a simple yet imaginative storyline. The humorous text, written in short rhythmic passages, is easy for early readers to master.

This is a great pick for children who just don't like to sleep -- and you know who they are.","Parents need to know that this is a book about bedtime drama -- and that while the protagonist may want to run away, she ends up being too tired to go through with her plan.

Spells,Kids may need help jumping into clever frog-prince tale.,"The small green frog is full of wishes and dreams. One day he finds a book of spells, and tries to cast all sorts of magic words into the caldron, hoping to become a handsome prince and kiss the princess. Different combinations have different results, until finally he gets his wish ... for a moment. Unfortunately for him, a simple twist at the end brings him back to reality.
","This rather quirky story might be called a fractured fairytale, a playful twist on the story of the frog and the princess, and it is cleverly told. This time the story is told from the frog's point of view, and it doesn't turn out all that well for him. The format is as clever as the tale. Once the frog starts putting together his spells from the torn-up pages of the spell book, the pages of the actual book are cut in half.  On one side, the spell has been divided in two so the reader can make it start and end in a variety of ways. The top half of the other side shows the head of the creature the frog becomes, the bottom his bottom. This gives the frog, and the reader, all sorts of possible combinations that are silly and not quite what the frog is hoping for. The format is fun and unique and meant for someone comfortable with reading and following what is going on. However, it may be rather confusing for some kids, especially for  a younger reader trying the book out on his or her own.  Also, the twist at the end, written in small print and located on the very last page, might be missed altogether.
As befitting the book, the illustrations are truly eerie, a bit mysterious, and definitely magical. The animals are especially fantastic. Subtle tones are set against black paper, and created by pencil, watercolors, shredded paper and a bit of glitter.","Parents need to know wthat this book is very clever, maybe too clever for younger readers.

","The adventures of these two amphibians make for some of the simplest -- and most enjoyable -- chapter books for developing readers. Toad and Frog are, indeed, friends, and their respect for each other comes through on every page. Arnold Lobel's writing is engaging without being cloying, and the vocabulary is basic without being babyish. The story is illustrated with swamp-toned sketches of the friends and their surroundings.
Even though the characters are fictional, the feelings they share (and convey to their young readers) are very real, and the care they show for each other and the world around them stands as a good example of behavior. Children seem to relate strongly to these tales. In response to ""The Letter,"" in which Frog becomes Toad's pen pal to fulfill his friend's desire for mail, one boy said, ""I never get mail either! That is sad!"" The themes of friendship and growing up seem to resonate strongly -- even if they're expressed by amphibians.","Parents need to know that kids readily relate to these two friends, and the stories in Frog and Toad Are Friends strike a chord with developing readers. The short five tales about friendship have simple, easy-to-follow plots that will engage both advanced and emerging readers alike. These stories explore the many facets of friendship and make for a timeless read.

Dread Nation,Riveting alt-history post-Civil War zombie thriller.,"DREAD NATION is a historical zombie thriller that takes place in an alternative universe in which the Civil War ended when the dead at Gettysburg began to rise up and consume soldiers from both armies. Protagonist Jane McKeene was born just two days before zombies -- aka shamblers -- emerged, and the fact that she's obviously biracial has complicated life for her rich, white mother, the mistress of a powerful Kentucky plantation. In an effort to help fight the undead, the government enacts the Native and Negro Reeducation Act, which forces black and indigenous children to attend combat school, where they're basically taught to be zombie slayers to protect whites. Jane is nearly done with her training at  prestigious Baltimore combat school to become an Attendant (a bodyguard to wealthy whites), when she and her beautiful light-skinned classmate Katherine are taken away to serve as border patrol at a dangerous frontier outpost, Summerland. At Summerland, which is led by a racist religious fanatic and his lawman son, Jane manages to convince everyone that blue-eyed, golden-haired Katherine is white, and that she's the lady's Attendant. After Jane succeeds in installing Katherine among the white citizens, the two young women uncover a host of dangerous secrets -- about the town, the undead, and the future.
","The action is so compelling in this fantastic alt-history zombie thriller that re-imagines post-Civil War America, it's the kind of novel that's difficult to stop reading once you start. Dread Nation's main character, Jane, is everything you want in a protagonist: courageous, clever, funny, willful, and impulsive, but also vulnerable, generous, and selfless. She doesn't bother with humility -- she knows the damage she can do with her sickles and that table manners and upper-crust etiquette are trifling considerations. And although there's a tiny love triangle with two viable suitors, the romance is way on the back burner while Jane (who's biracial but not fair enough to pass) and her perfectly put-together classmate Katherine (who is described as having a passing-for-white complexion, blue eyes, and golden hair) work together to defeat the nefarious plans of Summerland's vile father-and-son preacher and sheriff. Katherine enjoys the finer things but also resents how her beauty is also a burden and that she's underestimated (even by Jane, once in a while) because of her face.
Jane and Katherine lead the charge, while the men in the story are all supporting characters, whether they're good, evil, or roguish. Red Jack, Jane's former beau, is desperate to find his little sister (who, like Katherine, can ""pass""); Gideon is the genius forced to keep Summerland's electricity flowing; and Summerland's reigning father and son believe in the despicable white supremacy that keeps the frontier town's black Attendants in place. In flashbacks, readers will also get to know Jane's white, plantation-running Momma, as well as the various black aunties, particularly Aggie, who raised Jane at Rose Hill. There's also a layered quality to the story: Readers can enjoy it for the surface layer of zombie slaying or dig in further to uncover the sociopolitical and historical commentary. Readers of color may especially connect to the themes of oppression and systemic racism.","Parents need to know that Dread Nation is an alternative-history zombie thriller that takes place after the U.S. Civil War ends -- not with the South's surrender, but when the dead begin to rise up on the battlefields of Gettysburg and Chancellorsville. Author Justina Ireland explores what would've happened had zombies (or shamblers, as they're called in the book) stopped the war in order for Americans to come together to battle the undead (or force black and indigenous folks to fight them). Like Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, the book features a good deal of violence, as is appropriate in a story about zombie slayers (lots of deaths either from the undead eating live humans, or from humans shooting, stabbing, decapitating the undead, or from people beating, stabbing, and shooting one another). There are also some racial slurs of the era (""darkie,"" ""colored,"" ""pickaninny,"" ""coon,"" etc.) in the story. Parents and teens who read the book together can discuss a host of sociopolitical and historical issues, from institutional racism and white supremacy to shadism, passing, educational segregation, well-intentioned but ineffective white benevolence, and more.

Suicide Notes from Beautiful Girls,"Lurid violence and body count mount in grim, dark thriller.","High school juniors June and Delia used to be best friends and had an almost telepathic relationship. Then, about a year ago, things went weird and they've hardly spoken. But when June, along with the rest of the school, gets the shocking news that Delia has committed suicide, she's sure it's not true and that her onetime BFF was murdered. As she pursues a relentless quest for the truth, it gets harder and harder to know what's real -- or whom to trust.
","Fans of the dark side will appreciate the moral ambiguity in this fast-moving tale of a relatively innocent teen girl trying to do the right thing in an increasingly dangerous, untrustworthy world. Others may find SUICIDE NOTES FROM BEAUTIFUL GIRLS too lurid or too profoundly hopeless.
Told in alternating present-day and flashback segments, it effectively establishes the characters and their complex motivations, while offering a glimpse of pure evil, making it more akin to a horror tale than most thrillers.","Parents need to know that, besides several violent deaths, Suicide Notes from Beautiful Girls is packed with sex (same- and opposite-sex), drinking, drugging, deception, and seriously toxic relationships.

Tomorrow I'll Be Kind,Book about kindness is beautiful but preachy.,"In TOMORROW I'LL BE KIND, three friends --  bunny, a cat, and a mouse -- get in a variety of situations that call them to be kind. Every two pages, a keyword like ""helpful,"" ""gentle,"" ""generous,"" and so forth are presented in a hand-lettered and large, stylized font. The pages in-between show how this word can be brought to life in brightly colored, commonplace settings (playground, playing at home, bike riding at the park, a street baseball game, etc.). The final pages review the keywords and show the animals asleep and dreaming together about all the ways they had been kind.
","This attractive book delivers its message with too heavy a hand, but it's engaging illustrations and hard-to-argue-with lessons on kindness will appeal to young readers and adults. The hand- lettering of the keywords and bright, inviting pictures show kid-friendly ways to be helpful, honest, generous, and kind. The illustrations cluster around the keywords, or weave in and out of the letters in playful ways, but this sometimes makes them difficult to decipher. The illustrations mostly extend the text in critical ways -- showing just how kids can ""take the lead,"" ""wait"" or ""think of what others need."" Although some examples are abstract enough that the pictures will only make sense to older readers. The colors and clothing on the animals are generally gender neutral, meaning all kids will be able to see themselves in these pages.
The biggest gripe is that the text teaches so explicitly about how to behave with kindness that it can come off as preachy and too obvious. Still, a book aimed at instructing kids on how to be more kind is a wise addition to any children's bookshelf, and one this pretty is likely to be requested over and over.","Parents need to know that Tomorrow I'll Be Kind, by Jessica Hische is the follow-up to her best-selling Tomorrow I'll Be Brave. This book follows a bunny, a cat, and a mouse as they model for young readers various ways to be kind. They offer bandages to a friend with a scraped knee, share gifts, save money to pay for a broken window, give comfort to a friend who's grandma died, donate toys, and offer to share ice cream, among other situations. Messages about being helpful, being a leader, taking responsibility, sharing, and more of the same are impossible to miss. The animal friends are impeccable role models; even when they make mistakes, they always do the best thing to turn it around. The stylized hand lettering of the ""kind"" key words and the colorful illustrations will certainly ppeal to kids.

Using only her wits, she outsmarts the beast, finds the prince, and learns an important lesson about the importance of believing in yourself and expecting respect from those who love you.  ","THE PAPER BAG PRINCESS is the stuff that fairy tales are made of -- a true classic about what being a hero, challenging dragons, and finding true love is all about.

The Report Card,"Nora uses her genius to protest testing, grades.","Nora is a genius, but since early childhood she has hidden that fact from both teachers and family. She doesn't like to be different, to perform, to have people stare at her, to be expected to achieve according to someone else's rules. So she goes underground, keeps her giftedness to herself, and tries to fit in. But in fifth grade everything changes.
When she sees her best friend feel stupid because he did poorly on the standardized achievement tests, she decides to protest grades by getting low ones. But the attention this draws from her parents and the school leads to her secret being revealed, and her worst fears being realized: her school wants her in the gifted program, her parents want her in an exclusive academy, and everyone starts treating her differently. Perhaps a school-wide testing protest is the answer.

Here he has decided to go for more realism -- Nora's protest doesn't sweep the school, make the national news, or start a revolution. Rather than an unabashed triumph over the system of testing and grades, Nora accomplishes little besides being allowed to have some say in the direction of her life.
Since Clements has so clearly stated the problems with this system, some readers may find the ending disappointing, a rarity in his novels. But it may get both kids and adults thinking about the subject and, since he has provided no template for real change, wondering for themselves how things could be made different.","Parents need to know that the author is straightforwardly raising an issue of great importance to children: the use and misuse of grades and testing in school. But the way the main character goes about it is questionable at best, raising even more issues -- giftedness, protest, rebellion, and achievement.

"The Red Pyramid: The Kane Chronicles, Book 1",Percy Jackson author tackles more complex Egyptology.,"Everything goes wrong when 14-year-old Carter, his Egyptologist father, and 12-year-old sister Sadie go to the British Museum for a private viewing of the Rosetta Stone. Carter and Sadie watch as their dad mysteriously blows the stone apart and gets trapped in a sarcophogus that disappears into the floor. That's when long-lost Uncle Amos helps them escape on a magic boat that whisks them to a Brooklyn mansion in seconds. And that's just the start of magical occurrences that involve ancient Egyptian gods unleashed, magicians from the House of Life who are trying to keep them in check, and Carter and Sadie caught in the middle, desperately trying to channel powers they never knew they had. They have only a few days to figure it all out before the god Set builds a gigantic pyramid in Phoenix and tries to destroy the whole of North America.
","Percy Jackson fans will probably be satisfied, but they have to like ancient history as much if not more than they like god-on-monster action. There are so many gods and their backstories to keep track of, but then that's the history of ancient Egypt: complicated. Now that kids know what a ba is and how to pull things out of the Duat and restore Ma'at, etc., etc., subsequent novels in the series will be an easier read, but this one may take a couple read-throughs to get it all straight.
History lessons aside, this is a fun ride and mostly because Carter and Sadie are such great characters. They also have that signature sardonic wit that Percy was known for. Great one-liners come out of nowhere to lighten the mood when facing all manner of horrible creatures and almost certain death. When they are faced with a scary demon in the underworld it comes out that he's not only Lord of Blood and Wine, but also Lord of Perfume. Sadie asks politely if her brother can have a sample before they sail on.","Parents need to know that this series is by Rick Riordan, author of the hugely popular Percy Jackson series. While Percy cavorted with Greek gods and half-gods, brother and sister Carter and Sadie come face to face with ancient Egyptian gods, magicians, and god-monsters. There are plenty of battle scenes against gods and monsters that feel very much like fantasy, with a bit of bloodshed, and some scenes in a bleak afterlife. At the beginning of the book Carter and Sadie, who lost their mother a few years before, deal with the disappearance of their father, whom they fear will never return. Carter and Sadie, despite their differences (raised different places, and Carter looks more like his black father while Sadie looks like their white mother), are constantly looking out for each other as they deal with some harsh realities about Egyptian history and their place in it. The audiobook version is read by Kevin R. Free and Katherine Kellgren.

Bat and the Waiting Game,"Story of boy on the spectrum explores feelings, challenges.","BAT AND THE WAITING GAME is the second book in this series about an animal-loving boy on the autism spectrum. Bixby Alexander Tam, known as Bat, has a mom who's a veterinarian, and she allows Bat to keep the skunk kit she rescued in A Boy Called Bat. Bat's world revolves around caring for his baby skunk. But there are things that get in the way -- like school, his sister and her friends, every other weekend at his dad's house, and even his own budding friendship with a classmate. Bat's patience is tried, and that's not easy for a kid on the spectrum who focuses so well on the thing he wants the most! Waiting might be difficult for Bat, but he has a chance to rise to the new challenges he faces in this story.
","This loving and realistic portrayal of a kid who loves skunks explores the emotional complexities of life on the autism spectrum. Whereas A Boy Called Bat focused on the skunk kit that Bat's family had taken in, Bat and the Waiting Game gives the emotions that Bat has about his skunk a starring role. Because it's written from Bat's perspective, readers can understand what makes him tick. Apologies don't make sense to Bat -- so why waste breath on them? Looking people in the eyes is uncomfortable, which is why Bat avoids eye contact. Maintaining a friendship after an emotional outburst is really hard, but Bat tries his best to move forward.
Kids who have friends on the spectrum -- or who struggle with Bat's challenges themselves -- will find a flawed and lovable hero in Bat. Author Elana K. Arnold gives voice to a misunderstood population, and it's about time.","Parents need to know that Bat and the Waiting Game is the second installment in Elana K. Arnold's Bat series, and it looks a little more intently into the life and times of a boy on the autism spectrum. When Bat gets triggered by things he cannot control, he reacts physically by flapping his arms, standing on the balls of his feet, sometimes shaking his head back and forth. The adults in his life know how to calm Bat down, but Bat himself has the tendency to be self-critical, making this sequel more emotionally complex than its predecessor, A Boy Called Bat.

"City of Ashes: The Mortal Instruments, Book 2",City of Bones sequel is gripping but a lot gorier.,"In this sequel to City of Bones, Clary continues to be torn between Simon and Jace; an Inquisitor, who has an agenda of her own, comes from the Clave to investigate Jace's relationship to Valentine; and Valentine gathers an army of demons to destroy the Clave. And if none of that makes any sense to you, that shows that you need to read the first book before tackling this one.
","Fans will be glad that author Cassandra Clare wastes no time in recapitulation of the first book -- she slams straight into the action here. In the first book, City of Bones, a complex world of demons, werewolves, vampires, faeries, and Shadowhunters, hidden within our own and filled with politics, factions, and history, was set up and partially explained. CITY OF ASHES won't make much sense without having read the first book.
And there's a lot more of that action than in the first book. It's also a lot bloodier, sometimes unnecessarily, and sometimes disturbingly so, such as when a major character's throat and wrists are slit. But fans of the series will find many of the elements that first drew them in: an engrossing, if melodramatic, writing style that makes the pages fly by; a complex and fully realized parallel world; intriguing mysteries that are more fully fleshed out here, but not yet solved; and appealing teen characters who are gradually discovering new and unusual abilities. Teens who don't mind the gore will find this is gripping sequel.","Parents need to know that there is a lot of gory violence here -- more so than in the first book. This installment includes throat and wrist cutting, dismemberment, stabbing, severed limbs, and more, all with lots of blood. There are also mild sexual references, including to incest and homosexuality, and some kissing. Teens who didn't read the first book will be confused by this one.

Some Bugs,"Makes looking at bugs look exciting, gets kids outdoors.","SOME BUGS shows all kinds of insects and points out their different characteristics in simple rhyming verse. ""Some bugs STING./ Some bugs BITE./ Some bugs STINK./ And some bugs FIGHT!"" Scale is provided by placing the insects in settings with plants, logs, a picnic basket, or flower pot, where they're observed by larger creatures: a cat, raccoon, bird, mole, and little kid.
","Some Bugs does a fantastic job of introducing kids to the world of insects. By focusing on what a bug does -- flutter, crawl, roll up in a ball, hop, glide, swim, hide, etc. -- the book gets kids interested in the actions they can observe, rather than focusing on the insects' names. Yet each insect is identified on a busy two-page spread at the back.
The colorful mixed-media spreads (in some ways reminiscent of the more spare Eric Carle books) draw readers in and should inspire kids to get outside and look for bugs in their own backyard, neighborhood, or park. ","Parents need to know that Some Bugs is a colorful, rhyming picture book that in very simple text describes a bunch of different insects in terms of they what they do -- flutter, glide, click, buzz, build, hunt, etc. It makes bug life look exciting and bug hunting/observing look fun. It also urges kids to get outside, ""KNEEL down close,/ LOOK very hard,/ and find/ SOME BUGS/ in your backyard!"" A spread at the back identifies each insect pictured in the book, including a katydid, monarch butterfly, mosquito, boll weevil, bumble bee, stink bug, and praying mantis. Some Bugs is a great choice for Earth Day or any day.

Creature ABC,"Part alphabet book, part captivating animal encounter.","This massive ABC book features two photographic spreads for each letter. The first two pages present the letter in both upper and lower case with a portrait of the featured animal; the second spread presents another portrait and the animal’s name.
","The bold, simple presentation of this striking book belies the complexity of the images. Andrew Zuckerman’s photographs encourage viewers to regard wild animals in a whole new way. Close-up portraits and focused partial shots invite readers to marvel at the toenails of an elephant, admire the flexibility of a giraffe’s neck, and go eye to eye with a lion. Some of the letter associations are obvious -- A for alligator, for example -- but some of the choices are pleasant surprises. N showcases nocturnal animals, J introduces a jackrabbit, and Q features a wonderful shot of a porcupine’s quills. A glossary provides more information about the featured creatures. The only flaw is the heft of this large book: Small hands won't be able to handle it on their own. But adults will be happy to pore over it with them, again and again.
	 Arresting portraits against a white background are simply beautiful.","Parents need to know that Creature ABC is a this lovely book that uses wonderful wildlife photos to help teach the alphabet.

How to Eat Fried Worms,Kids are sure to devour this gross-out book.,"Billy Forrester's always up for a dare, but this time he's in for a real challenge. His friends, Alan and Joe, bet Billy fifty dollars that he can't eat 15 worms in 15 days. Billy survives the first one, chokes down the second, and practically relishes the third.
When Joe and Alan realize that Billy's going to stick to his goal -- and even enjoy doing it -- they try everything they can to keep Billy from reaching his goal. Billy, with the help of his family and his friend Tom, tries to stay one step ahead of their tricks. They even create new recipes -- from Southern Fried Worm to Whizbang Worm Delight -- to help Billy reach his goal.
","There's one thing to be said for HOW TO EAT FRIED WORMS: It gets kids to read. Its disgusting premise, a bet about eating worms, is so in tune with middle-grade humor that even kids who say they hate books will read it and recommend it to their friends. In the end, this may not be literature, but the humor will genuinely appeal to kids reluctant to leave behind the silly humor of early reader series like The Adventures of Captain Underpants.
Its short chapters and numerous pictures help young readers ease the transition to longer chapter books. But the book, which has now spawned a movie, will have less appeal for adults. Grown-ups are likely to get tired of the repetition -- there are only so many ways to cook a worm, after all -- and might feel slightly sick along the way.","Parents need to know that this book's title isn't just a gimmick; it's actually a story about eating real, live worms (or, in some cases, worms that have been cooked and killed). Kids will laugh, but adults are likely to get grossed out. There is a fistfight, and two of the boys cheat to win the bet. And since the book was released in 1973, some gender roles seem outdated.

But between the fact that a possum is determined to break into the henhouse, and the fact that the hen Moosh and the chicks are spending all their time with Lillian, a mysterious white dog next door, and acting quite strange, peace and quiet don't seem to be on the agenda.
","Between the plot complications, the wacky characters, and the wisecracks on the side that are clearly directed at the adult bystanders, not all kids are going to have the patience for this one. But for those who do, there are plenty of rewards, especially if they like characters with names like Vince the Funnel (a dachshund who seems eternally cursed with one of those veterinary lampshades) and frequent surprises. Not to mention interesting lessons about search-and-rescue operations, dog shows, and finding common ground in unexpected circumstances.","Parents need to know that The Legend of Diamond Lil is a follow-up to The Trouble with Chickens, the first chapter book by best-selling picture book author Doreen Cronin (Duck for President, Dooby Dooby Moo), and continues the barnyard adventures of retired search-and-rescue dog turned detective J.J.

Fetch,Spare text and evocative art capture dog's beach adventure.,"FETCH tells the story of a dog playing fetch at the beach. When he's sent chasing after a red ball, he ends up in the ocean, where he encounters a host of ocean creatures. Each page is printed with one action verb, and we see the dog swimming with fish, diving near a seal, playing catch with seagulls, paddling near dolphins, and even floating high above a lone shark who's not a threat, intent on its own ocean business. The story ends with the dog returning the ball to a little girl, ready to play fetch again.
","The heart of Fetch is in the art; though it's a simple story -- dog chases red ball -- it feels like high adventure. The dog crashes through waves and paddles next to leaping dolphins. In two of the spreads, Hurley cleverly turns the book sideways so the longer spreads can depict the mysterious depths of the ocean. Overall, she conveys the exuberance of play and freedom at the beach.
The spare text works well with the evocative art, though some of the verbs are more fun and vivid than others: ""splash"" vs. the more abstract ""meet""; ""shake"" vs. the more pedestrian ""run."" But the text is not the main attraction. Parents and kids alike can take pleasure in the bounding dog, let loose to play on the beach.","Parents need to know that Jorey Hurley's Fetch, similar to her cclaimed debut picture book, Nest, is spare and evocative with very little text -- only one word per two-page spread -- making it a good choice for very young children. The words are mostly simple action verbs: ""splash,"" ""swim,"" ""dive,"" ""run,"" ""float,"" ""play."" But the art tells the story in much more detail, graphically conveying  sense of unleashed freedom.

Will they be able to see past his appearance to the lovable bear who lies underneath? When the school bullies arrive on the playground, Boris gets the opportunity to redeem himself in the eyes of his classmates.
","While parents will have likely read versions of this story many times before, kids will get a kick out of Boris' trials and will be surprised and pleased by the final outcome. Even the bullies are swashbuckling rats who add excitement without ever crossing the line to real worry. The pictures could undermine the idea that anyone could possibly be scared of Boris -- he's just adorable -- but he is convincingly big and the other animal classmates are dwarfed in comparison.","Parents need to know that this sweet book has a good message and absolutely nothing offensive.

Prisoner of Night and Fog,"Compelling mystery offers intro, insight into Hitler's rise.","In early 1930s Munich, the National Socialist (Nazi) party is just coming to power. Seventeen-year-old Gretchen grew up hearing the story of how her father died saving Adolf Hitler's life, and her family's enjoyed Hitler's protection and favor ever since. When Daniel, a mysterious young Jewish journalist, tells her that the story isn't true, she determines to learn the truth about what happened to her father. The more she digs into the past of the burgeoning Nazi party's power elite, Gretchen finds herself really listening to what Hitler's saying and for the first time realizes that everything she's believed has been wrong. Daniel's as committed to the truth as Gretchen is, even when their questions and especially their blossoming romantic feelings put their lives in danger.
","PRISONER OF NIGHT AND FOG by debut author Anne Blankman is a gripping, compelling story that makes a crucial and complicated period in Western history relatable for teens. The characters are believable and well developed, and the plot deftly weaves a young girl's coming of age with political chaos and solving a mystery. The expositional writing at the very beginning is a bit weak:  It's sometimes hard to follow who's who. But characters quickly fall into place as the pace quickens. The ending is satisfying, but leaves plenty of room to look forward to the sequel, which is planned to pick up the action in 1933 when Hitler's elected Chancellor of Germany.","Parents need to know that the historical setting in early-1930s Munich makes Prisoner of Night and Fog  good way to introduce teens to the background causes of World War II and the Holocaust in some depth. Hitler's an important character, and kids can think about whether he had a clinical mental illness and about how someone with ideas like getting rid of all the Jewish people in Germany could gain so much political power. Violence is mostly in the form of fistfights, riots, and protests, but there's one throat slashing that includes detail like spraying blood. There's also a couple of instances of violent treatment of animals, including the killing of a beloved pet cat. The love interests kiss a half dozen times or so, but the descriptions are brief and the action's always above the shoulders.

He asks a variety of people, including his teacher, his grandpa, and the mailman, who give him a grab bag of evasive half-answers. The teen girl who walks him to school says, ""You plant a seed and it grows into a baby tree."" All this makes for charming, lightly humorous illustrations. Finally, the boy asks his parents, who answer him with straightforward, scientifically accurate information about conception and gestation, information that's also reassuringly simple and kid-friendly.

The young boy narrator tells his story in a realistic kid's voice that rings true to his age and is lightly humorous. His school friends, and the babies that grow on the baby tree he imagines, are nicely multiracial. The information the parents provide him in the story itself is accurate but not overly graphic.
The implicit message for parents is: Answer the question honestly, but don't overwhelm kids with information they didn't necessarily ask for.

A nearby note asks them to care for \""Jacob\"" until they are able to come back and get him. The couple, John and Marta, quickly discover that Jacob is mute, but they learn as the days pass that he has an uncanny affinity for music, and he also seems to be able to communicate with the many animals around the farm. While John and Marta do everything they can to make Jacob's life happy and to provide a loving home, they know he'll probably not be with them for long, and they feel it's their responsibility to search for whomever left Jacob with them. What should they tell their neighbors and people in town about how this unusual but remarkable child came into their care? What will happen if and when the writer of the note returns for Jacob?
","This wonderfully told story is, at its core,  mystery: Who is the boy on the porch, and where did he come from? Sharon Creech does a superb job of building tension as the story progresses, balancing vignettes of the boy's happy life on the farm with scenes of the anxious search for his identity.
The chapters are short and the prose simple and straightforward -- much like the humble country people it depicts. Yet there's also a realistic complexity to the main characters, and it's easy to relate to their shifting emotions as situations and circumstances change. This is a great book for young readers, who will enjoy both the story and the mostly fond depiction of rural life (in an unspecified year). ","Parents need to know that The Boy on the Porch is an easy-to-read, simple-to-follow chapter book by Newbery Medal-winning author Sharon Creech (Walk Two Moons). It's about a young mute boy who unexpectedly turns up asleep on the front porch of a childless couple's farmhouse, with a note asking that he be taken care of until the unknown writer of the note can return to get him. The tension in the story comes from the boy's new caretakers struggling to provide a loving and stimulating home while also trying to find who left the boy. The book could provoke fears of abandonment -- who leaves a child on the porch of a stranger's house? -- but the couple is so thoughtful and kind, and the boy's life with them so idyllic, that the overall tone is mostly positive. There are scenes of frustration and anxiety for both the couple and the boy but no violence at all. The story's resolution might be emotional for some kids -- and parents -- and not what they were expecting.

The Bear and the Piano,Enchanting book about the love of music and the tug of home.,"In THE BEAR AND THE PIANO,  a young bear finds a piano that's inexplicably sitting in a clearing in the forest. He touches it, makes a sound, and keeps coming back ""for days and weeks and months and years, until eventually the sounds that came from the strange thing were beautiful."" His bear friends gather in the clearing to listen, but then he's discovered by a girl and her father, who take him to the big, bright city where he plays ""sold-out concerts in giant theaters."" The bear loves music but also misses home. When he travels back to the forest, he's afraid the other bears are angry at him for leaving. But then he discovers that they've kept his piano safe in the shade and pinned his playbills and reviews on the tree behind it, so he sits down to give another concert: ""This time, for the most important audience of all.""
","This lovely picture book celebrates the transcendent power of art and the importance of maintaining connection with friends and family. The illustrations are beautifully evocative, with dreamlike light filtering through the trees in the forest contrasting with busy, darker-hued pages of success in the bustling city. Author-illustrator David Litchfield is based in the United Kingdom, but the city appears to be New York City, with mention of ""Broadway"" and street signs depicting the intersection of Broadway and West 58th Street.
The message is artfully subtle, never clunky or heavy-handed, and the takeaway for kids may be unconscious, calming any anxieties about following their deepest desires and dreams, and reassuring them that they'll be loved and supported even as they go forth.","Parents need to know that The Bear and the Piano by David Litchfield is a beautiful and moving book about the power of music and the abiding love of home and family. After a bear who finds an abandoned piano in the forest becomes an acclaimed concert pianist, he returns home to play for the bears who originally encouraged and supported him. The story deftly handles the conflicted emotions of leaving family and home to pursue your interests, offering an encouraging story of a bear who opts to leave home to develop his talent but is also able to maintain ties with loved ones. A sweet, tear-inducing story celebrating art and connection.

"Buckle and Squash: The Perilous Princess Plot, Book 1","Uproarious princess adventure is clever, sarcastic, zany.","Lavendar dreams all day of being a princess, while sister Ezra is much more practical, doing chores and taking care of her goat, Gertrude. But when Lavendar gets kidnapped by an evil villain named Clive, who's desperate for the ransom money and thinks she's a real princess, chaos and hilarity ensue as Lavendar tries to perfect the role, Ezra tries to save her, and Clive tries to pull off his kidnapping plan while doing as little actual kidnapping as possible. ","BUCKLE AND SQUASH: THE PERILOUS PRINCESS PLOT both challenges readers' assumptions about princess books and spoofs the genre. It covers every aspect of a classic princess story with its tale of adventure, kidnapping, dragon-slaying, and rescue, while simultaneously pointing out the utter silliness of such tales every step of the way.
Author Sarah Courtauld's writing is so vivid, fresh, and self-conscious that there are just as many word jokes scattered about as there are clever twists and turns. And though there's no shortage of references to death and plagues, they're made with an absurdity and slapstick that never feels gruesome or violent, much less sad. Devoted readers of princess fare will find the genre elevated here, and newcomers to reading or the genre will find it difficult to match this level of writing and engagement.","Parents need to know that Buckle and Squash: The Perilous Princess Plot, Book 1 is a quippy, clever take on princess fare that entertains while simultaneously unpacking the tropes of the genre. Sisters Ezra and Lavendar represent two sides of the princess coin: Ezra wants to slay dragons; Lavendar wants to be rescued from one by a prince. The book is set in medieval times and makes frequent reference to battles, sword fights, plagues, and untimely deaths, but all are presented with a tongue-in-cheek humor that keeps up the suspense without feeling morbid. A book that will please both princess lovers and their skeptics.

Gossip Girl Books,Addictive high-society fluff with iffy messages.,"Manhattan's young, rich, and beautiful throw parties, fall in love, and stress about getting into Ivy League colleges -- all while wearing designer clothes. Their comings and goings are recorded by a secret spy within their fold on GossipGirl.net. The 13 books in the series follow mean-girl Blair, earthy Serena, stoner Nate, edgy Dan and Vanessa, cute Jenny (and others in their circle). Beyond fancy vacations and charity events, they get glam in other ways: Serena models for a hot designer and Dan publishes a poem in The New Yorker. And then there are the inevitable romances: Nate and Blair. Dan and Serena. Nate and Jenny. Dan and Vanessa. You get the picture.
","This is really superficial stuff, but it's no wonder it's such a hit; these rich kids' designer lives are the stuff we've all fantasized about. It's just as easy to relish the high moments (Serena hooks up with a rock star; Dan and Vanessa finally get it on) as it is the disasters (Blair dates her Yale interviewer, only to find out he's the married father of one of her classmates; Nate gets busted trying to buy pot in Central Park). While none of the characters are particularly noble, it's fun watching them throw fabulous benefits (complete with Kate Spade gift bags!) or jet off to a tropical island for the holidays.
 The author expertly weaves their various storylines together for maximum energy. But do your kids -- the ones you trust not to take this world too seriously -- really have to read the whole series? (Probably just one or two will do.) The GossipGirl.net interludes are the perfect device, because they remind sophisticated readers of their place in the whole mess: We are not these characters. We are not their friends. We are simply gawkers.","Parents need to know that characters in these addicting guilty pleasures drink, smoke, do drugs, throw parties, and have sex. Their party lifestyle is glamorized (and their own parents are permissive about their drinking); sex is not graphic, but it isn't always equated with love, either. Also, brand names run throughout, from high-end clothing designers to skin products to alcohol brands. They are definitely fun books -- but for grounded teens who aren't going to be swayed by the bad behavior here.

Vamped,Vampire series debut pales in Twilight's shadow.,"Gina is not like other vampires you know. This is a girl who likes mall shopping -- and after clawing her way out of her coffin her first thoughts are about finding her stylist. But she has inner strength to match her mega-attitude, and when she finds out that an evil vampiress is recruiting unsuspecting high school kids into her own blood-sucking army, she decides to take charge. Between dodging stakes, motivating her troops, and making psychic connections with her vampire boyfriend, she's living a very busy (eternal) life.
","Teens will appreciate Gina's unique stake, or uh, take on vampirism -- she worries how she will survive eternity without being able to check herself out in the mirror, for example. In the end, though, the campy vamp protagonist is really all this book has going for it. The plot is slow to unfold, and readers will likely have lost interest long before the heated battles for vampire dominance begin.
  ","Parents need to know that there is certainly a lot of gore in this vampire book, but the narrator's a bit of an airhead, which makes the violence seem more yucky than horrific. The main characters do share some smokin' kisses -- and even wake up together half-clothed after spending the night together.

For one thing, her mom, the formidable Ms. Tucci, is no longer abducted by aliens, so Tip has to follow a lot more rules. Also, the Boov alien known as J. Lo, Tip's companion for most of the first book, is living with them but having trouble getting along with the locals. Then J. Lo learns that, back on the Boov world, he's being blamed for pretty much everything bad that happened to the Boov in Book 1. So, defying the woman known as Tipmom, the two head to the Boov world in the decrepit car Slushious, now converted to a spaceship. There, J. Lo is soon thrown into a dungeon, and Tip must brave sleazy politicians, flying billboards, people-sucking transport tubes, garbage-disposal facilities, space guns, and lots more if she's to save him. ","Just fasten your seatbelts and hold onto your hats, because Adam Rex is in classic form here. I mean, what can you say about a book whose narrator/protagonist is a 13-year-old with the given name Gratuity, who goes by Tip, whose BFF is a short gelatinous alien who goes by the name J. Lo nd who often converses with a deceased character from a previous installment in the tale? A book that features the unlikely meeting of the pop star and her otherworldly namesake at the Latin Grammys?
Also in classic form is  relentless marketing machine. Smek for President! coincides with the March 2015 release of the movie Home, a somewhat altered version of The True Meaning of Smekday. Just in case you might miss that fact, the book cover features a fetching portrait of the protagonists with the announcement that this is the series that inspired ""Home, Now A Major Motion Picture."" Protagonist/narrator Tip begins her tale with ""Maybe you read some other  book that got the Smekday Invasion wrong, or saw that animated movie they made about it ... "" If you didn't, she brings you up to speed anyway, as the events of the first book play a large role in the second installment of a planned series -- as does a fair amount of foreshadowing.","Parents need to know that Adam Rex's Smek for President! is the follow-up to his 2007 debut, The True Meaning of Smekday (adapted for the March 2015 movie Home). Rex's trademark mix of pure looniness, wild imagination, snarky comments, sudden wisdom, and sweet moments, complicated by oddball parent-child relationships, is in fine form, as protagonist Tip and her alien pal J. Lo take her Chevy-turned-spaceship to Titan, a moon of Saturn, where the inhabitants of J. Lo's world now live. The story combines text and graphic-novel sections nd delivers the goods in letting young readers share more wildly improbable adventures with the unlikely protagonists, complete with messages of family, friendship, and doing the right thing.

"Stormchaser: The Edge Chronicles, Book 2","Violent, overlong entry in imaginative Edge series.","Twig is thrilled to be sailing with his father, a renowned sky pirate captain. But when his blunder causes damage to the ship, he is grounded. This couldn't have come at a worse time: his father is about to go into the heart of a Great Storm to seek the magical stormphrax, which keeps the floating city of Sanctaphrax stable, and can purify the polluted waters of Undertown. Twig is determined to sneak on board anyway, but he is manipulated by a double-dealing crew member, and unwittingly exposes the ship, and his father, to terrible danger. Now it's up to him to salvage what he can of the voyage.
","Where the first of The Edge Chronicles was, well, edgy, this one goes over the edge. What was delightfully bizarre in the first book becomes unnecessarily gruesome in the second. The violence of a character named Screed is shockingly graphic and cruel, jolting the reader at times out of the fantasy world the author labors so hard to create.
Even this might be somewhat forgivable -- it is a small part of the story, after all -- but it happens during the long, seemingly interminable, middle section of the book, when there's little going on to distract the reader from it. Readers may feel they're slogging through the Mire with Twig just trying to get through the book. Strong writing and vivid imagination can't rescue this overlong entry, though patient readers will be rewarded by a very satisfying ending.","Parents need to know that this book is much more graphically violent than the first in this fantasy series. There are several cruel and bloody murders, after which the victims' toes are cut off, and one character's spine is broken. Readers who can handle the intense material will find an imaginative world here -- and fans will be excited to know there are other books in the series to pursue.

Her grandmother had a baby by an American soldier during the Vietnam War, but had to give her up, as the Communist party threatened to kill all American-fathered babies.
There is great excitement among the family who thinks that this American woman may bring money as gifts. Maybe she will bring family members back to America who have visions of riches from the few movies seen in town. The aunt arrives, without gifts but filled with love for her family. She also carries painful memories of leaving her mother. Binh and her aunt form a special relationship to help each other understand the different cultures.
","Even for sensitive readers, this book is a wonderful opportunity to expose young kids to a very different world and period of history, and it's a real eye-opener for American kids.
Not many families bring up the Vietnam War for dinner table conversation; it's hard to discuss for some adults, much less children. But Carolyn Marsden has made it easier by authoring WHEN HEAVEN FELL. Marsden has mastered how to describe a complicated period of history as though it's being interpreted by 9-year-old Binh. There are descriptions of children being killed by bombs and mothers hiding in the jungle to escape execution. These pieces are illustrated without blood, gore, or descriptive violence, but the fear is there. ","Parents need to know that this book is about recollections of the Vietnam War from the perspective of a Vietnamese family, including loved ones dying, bombs dropping, and villages destroyed.

There are few books that suitably describe this important piece of history for young readers, but this one has accomplished this through the eyes of a likeable Vietnamese 9-year-old girl. Though she was not yet born during this time, she is very curious and asks many questions. The reader learns of traditions, customs, and ways of life that are inherent in Vietnamese culture.

The Secret Hum of a Daisy,Girl struggles to find home in story of grief and healing.,"Grace and her artistic, free-spirited mother have never put down roots, something the 12-year-old is really starting to hate. But when her mother dies in a tragic accident, Grace is forced to move again to live with the grandmother who shipped her pregnant daughter away when she was still a teen. Grace is determined to cause enough trouble to be sent away, too, back to the home she and her mother shared with a warm family before that tragic night. But as she and her grandmother start to unpack the past and she meets other wonderful residents of the small town who share stories about her parents as well as their own heartbreaks, Grace begins to ""finally feel I am where I'm supposed to be.""
","Readers will certainly fall in love with the small town full of quirky, loving characters, but they may not be all that convinced of its believability.

The author's imaginative details about the nature-inspired art Grace's mother created, or the idyllic park her grandmother helped her community build, will leave readers wishing they could swing by for a visit, even while they'll know such a place couldn't really exist.
What's more real is Grace's grief: Even when the 12-year-old acts up or yells at her grandmother, it's easy to empathize with her as she sorts through complicated feelings of anger, sadness, and even guilt. It's hard not to get a lump in the throat as she and her grandmother get to a place where they can finally begin to heal together.","Parents need to know that The Secret Hum of a Daisy is about a girl forced to live with her estranged grandmother after her mother dies in an accident.

","This expertly written story shows that life after divorce has bumps, but it can be all right. WEEKENDS WITH MAX AND HIS DAD is not a gritty, in-your-face tale of loss. There's a sense of loss, and Max displays nxiety, but these characteristics are integrated, not spotlighted. For example, t times Max feels like ""somebody is sitting on his chest."" Sometimes he needs to run around -- a lot. On the day his dad moved out, Max was sent to his friend Warren's house, kept busy with movies and ice cream -- ""too busy to think about what was going on in his house."" Weekends with Max and His Dad provides a perfect opportunity for parents and kids to discuss divorce. The message is couched in the action. Max and his dad do stuff. Imbued in the stuff they do is the fact that life has changed forever -- but that they can make it through without losing themselves. With subtlety, it promotes  positive, natural dialogue about a very big life event.","Parents need to know that Linda Urban's Weekends with Max and His Dad shows what happens to a kid after his dad moves into his own apartment. Max, age 9, and his father, Leo, are getting accustomed to a new living situation by playing games and being very human. Yes, they both have big feelings, but the easy rapport between father and son provides a vehicle for gentle insights bout what it means to be a kid living in two homes. A great book to help parents and kids discuss divorce.

"Ivy + Bean: No News Is Good News: Ivy + Bean, Book 8","Girls start a newspaper in fun, mischievous adventure.","Everyone at lunch has low-fat Belldeloon cheese in single servings, and more important, they get to play with the red wax coating that can be molded into a thousand different shapes and uses. But Ivy and Bean can't get their hands on the expensive cheese until they score $10. To do that, they'll have to earn it, and when one of their fathers suggests collecting money for creating a neighborhood newspaper, they think they've hit the jackpot of easy money. Only now, they actually have to produce the newspaper, and what's more, the neighbors will read it!
","The eighth book in the Ivy + Bean series is by turns funny, relatable, heartwarming, silly, and prankish. It's an engaging read for young girls, with delicate black-and-white pencil drawings that portray the title characters' trials, tribulations, and fascinations with realism and wit. This book celebrates differences and girl friendship -- Ivy is quiet, Bean is loud, and in spite of their best efforts to resist their parents' urge to pair them together as friends, they realize they really do like each other. Readers will find a sidesplitting adventure that speaks their language, and parents can appreciate that this is the sort of book series that fosters a deep love of reading and sparks curiosity.","Parents need to know that Ivy + Bean: No News Is Good News, Book 8 of the popular Ivy + Bean series, has a few very minor instances of mischievous behavior (playing with fire with a magnifying glass, pretending to be dead, and spying on neighbors to write about them for a community newspaper). However, it's all done with a very light touch and lots of humor, and the girls ultimately learn some lessons about the lines they've crossed.

Animal Farm,Classic satirical allegory about the abuse of power.,"After years of oppression by Farmer Jones, the animals on his farm rise up and chase him away. They plan to run the farm themselves, for their own benefit. At first, the animals are able to work together and support each other. Gradually, however, the pigs begin making helpful suggestions about how the farm should be run. Before long, the pigs are at the top of the social ladder and the rest of the livestock are wondering what happened.
","The story and language are very simple, but Orwell is unnervingly precise in the way he depicts each step on the road from revolution to tyranny. ANIMAL FARM has been popular and highly acclaimed since its publication in 1945. In 2005, Time magazine chose it as one of the 100 best English-language novels, and the book ranks at 31 on the Modern Library List of Best 20th Century Novels. ","Parents need to know that Animal Farm is a biting satire of totalitarianism, written in the wake of World War II and published amid the rise of Soviet Russia. Although it tells a fairly simple story of barnyard animals trying to manage themselves after rebelling against their masters, the novel demonstrates how easily good intentions can be subverted into tyranny.

Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer,Series starter about teen lawyer teaches Courtroom 101.,"Thirteen year-old Theodore Boone gives legal advice to friends at school. He gets in over his head, though, when an illegal immigrant who has witnessed a murder seeks his help. Theo uses his great knowledge of the legal system -- and a little help from his lawyer parents -- to see that justice is done.
","This plot-driven novel hits a few dry spots along the way, but the author manages to weave in some legal basics and kids interested in the law will appreciate the Courtroom 101. Although Theo can be a little too good to be real at times, he is confronted with some tough moral conflicts that will give teen readers plenty to consider. In the end, the author has created an engaging enough premise to keep tweens looking forward to the next installment of the series, Theodore Boone: The Abduction.","Parents need to know that this book is a tamer version of Grisham’s adult novels. The central murder is described without excessive violence or detail, and there's no bad language or sex. The story delves into social issues such as homelessness and illegal immigrants. Theo sometimes breaks rules such as hacking into computer systems to help solve crimes, but he is generally driven by his interest in seeing justice served. He is surrounded by positive adult role models and knows when to ask adults for help.

Can she use her love of writing, even though English isn't her first language, to help her family, friends, and the immigrants pursue their dreams?

Georgie does goofy dances, plays beauty shop with her, and lets her sleep in her room. But Georgie is even more interested in gaining acceptance from her new stepsister, Tangie. As an 11-year-old, Georgie wants to know things that a teen big sister would know bout friends, guys, and looking and acting cool. But Tangie is still grieving the loss of her little sister and resents the intrusion of two stepsisters she doesn't want in her house. When an emergency occurs, Georgie blames herself, nd she defies the rules when she tries to make it better. This story of loss, healing, and renewal explores the meaning of family -- long with mean friends, crushes, and making things right. ","This moving story tackles divorce, illness, and loss head-on, and kids will appreciate the story's realness and the characters' slightly risky adventures. The loss and change that the girls undergo is heartrending, and the friend drama is very intense. That said, after all of the name calling, the reconciliations feel a little chaotic and flimsy, considering the things that have been said. And when friends threaten to abandon one another nd flip their switch at any imagined slight, it feels less like friendship and more like danger.
Still, the sense of family bonding and community connectedness is upbeat and hopeful, even though adults and kids alike fight with as much passion as they love. Fewer brand mentions nd more delving into the sensory world would have helped the story truly take flight.","Parents need to know that Love Like Sky is a touching story about an 11-year-old girl named Georgie who's djusting to going between her parents' houses.

"Nightshade, Book 1",Gripping werewolf thriller explores lust more than love.,"Calla Tor is no ordinary 17-year-old blond beauty; she's an alpha Guardian -- an elite werewolf who is part of a pack that protects the mysterious and powerful Keepers (witches) living in Colorado. One day Calla breaks a Guardian vow by shifting forms to save the life of a human guy. She reveals herself to him, thinking she'll never see him again, but when she returns to her elite private school, he's the new guy in town. His name is Shay, and he's only got eyes for Calla, but she's spoken for in an arranged betrothal to Ren, the sexy alpha male of a rival pack. Ren and Calla are destined to be ""mated"" on Halloween, unifying the two packs, but in the two months leading up to her marriage ceremony, Calla realizes Shay isn't just a normal human, and her feelings for him are too complicated to ignore. Calla must choose between her desire for Shay and the unknown and her relationship with Ren and their devoted pack.
","Andrea Cremer's first novel is as fast-paced and emotionally driven as you'd expect in a best-selling novel aimed at teen girls. Like many comparable heroines, Calla is a powerful protagonist who is nonetheless insecure when it comes to romance. She's inexperienced and unbelievably drawn to both her sexy alpha-male fiancé, Ren, and the sweet and passionate mystery guy, Shay. But by focusing so much on Calla's stomach-flipping feelings of infatuation, lust and (could it be?) first love, Cremer creates a heroine who somehow lacks the substance and spunk of Hex Hall's Sophie, the Mortal Instruments' Clary or Paranormalcy's Evie. Calla isn't particularly clever or funny or smart. She is, however, a fierce fighter, doting sister, and protective friend. Sadly, when it comes to her singular interest in Shay, she loses some of her appeal. The two guys each have their merits, and the story is obviously going to divide fans into Team Ren or Team Shay, but it's fairly obvious (at least in this first book) whom the author means Calla to be with ultimately. The cliffhanger ending may frustrate some readers, but luckily the sequel is already available, so you can immediately move on to Wolfsbane.","Parents need to know that this paranormal romance-adventure is heavy on violent action sequences and even heavier on teen hormones. The Guardian werewolves are involved in bloody skirmishes with other paranormal creatures, and there is a slight body count. Sexuality, love, and marriage are all discussed at length, because the protagonist is betrothed. There is some passionate kissing and touching, as well as the standard language you'd expect in a PG-13 movie (""s--t,"" ""ass,"" ""bitch,"" etc.). The book follows a strong, independent but emotionally fragile female protagonist who must choose between two lives and two suitors that represent different values.

The Kind of Friends We Used to Be,Accurate and heartwarming story about tween friendship.,"Marilyn and Kate are trying really hard to be friends again. They used to be best friends, but last year things changed. Marilyn thinks life for Kate would be a lot easier if she just took her advice on fashion, and Kate thinks Marilyn spends too much time thinking about her hair and what other people think of her. Will they ever get on the same page and get their friendship back on track?
","Dowell does a great job of capturing the ups and downs of tween friendships, as well as the way friendships can naturally change as kids discover their own interests and passions. Marilyn and Kate are wonderful, warm characters that girls can really identify with, and the middle school situations they find themselves in are common and very well written, with a nice touch of humor.
Kate's fascination with guitars and huge black boots are completely opposite from Marilyn's love of cheerleading and fashion, and there doesn't seem to be much common ground. The novel does an effective job of showing how much work friendships can be, but also shows how important friendships are, and that the effort is worthwhile.","Parents need to know that there isn't much to worry about here.

Saint Anything,Sensitive romance digs deep into difficult relationships.,"Sydney has always felt overshadowed by her charismatic but troubled big brother. After he’s imprisoned for injuring a boy while driving drunk, she feels more invisible than ever: Her mom is obsessively focused on him, and Sydney’s expected to fall in step. She seeks anonymity and a fresh start by enrolling in the public high school. Before long, she's pulled into the orbit of the Chatham family: lively, welcoming Layla is soon her best friend, and Layla's quiet brother, Mac, and their friends make her part of their circle. Sydney takes solace from her time with the Chathams, especially their mother, whose health is failing. When her own mother finally takes notice of her, Sydney fears her carefully built world will fall apart.
","Sydney, the likable, relatable heroine of this well-crafted romance, is a perfect example of how complicated life can be even when you try to make the right choices and be a good friend and daughter. Prolific author Sarah Dessen can always be counted on for nuanced characters and naturally unfolding plots. She's at her best in SAINT ANYTHING: The opening is high drama, but then Dessen settles into a comfortably paced, intimate story of a teen trying to find her place in her family and among her friends. The core teenage characters soon feel like familiar friends. Both maternal figures are simplistic characterizations, though their roles -- sage-sounding board and controlling disciplinarian -- will resonate with teens.
The rippling effects of alcohol and drug use are treated subtly but firmly. Dessen is less careful with a story line involving a sexual predator: The victim is dismissive of counseling and, without explanation, decides not to press charges. ","Parents need to know that Saint Anything, the thoughtful 12th novel by Sarah Dessen (The Moon and More), deals with underage drinking and substance abuse in a touching and realistic way. Two peripheral characters have made a mess of their lives -- and others' -- through drug and alcohol use. Central characters occasionally drink, but drunk characters are presented as repulsive, making selfish choices that cause widespread damage. Well-intentioned but distracted parents make some poor choices but eventually work hard to make things right. The victim of a sexual assault chooses not to press charges against her attacker, with no discussion of why she made that decision. Due to the mature content, we recommend this book for a slighter older audience than the publisher suggests.

The Wonderling,"Peril, appealing characters fill rich, imaginative fantasy.","Stuck in the Home for Wayward and Misbegotten Creatures for as long as he can remember, young fox-headed, human-bodied Number Thirteen, aka THE WONDERLING, has a grim life and little hope, just like all the human-animal hybrid children imprisoned there and enslaved when they get old enough. But when, at age 11, he overcomes his terror long enough to save small, birdlike Trinket from cruel bullies, she dubs him Arthur, after the King, and opens up a world of possibilities. She's determined to escape and find her lost relatives in the city of Lumentown; he dreams of learning where he came from, but is he brave enough to join Trinket in her crazy scheme? And then what?
","Author-artist Mira Bartok's first work for young readers builds a rich, complicated world populated with creepy villains, Dickensian street urchins, and brave orphan heroes with unexpected talents. World-building takes a bit, but by the time Arthur (soon to be known as The Wonderling) and Trinket escape the horrible orphanage and begin their wild adventures, readers will be laughing, cheering them on, thrilling at their predicaments, and hoping they manage to stay out of trouble, or at least keep from being eaten.","Parents need to know that there's a lot to love in The Wonderling, author-illustrator Mira Bartok's first book for young readers and the first installment in a new fantasy series. There's darkness and scary stuff as young hero Arthur, a ""groundling"" (human-animal hybrid) with a fox's head, one ear, and a human-type body, makes his way through a richly imagined steampunk world from creepy orphanage to creepier prison in quest of his roots. But readers unfazed by the monsters and situations of, say, Harry Potter should have no problem. Friendship literally changes the young hero's life, and there are strong messages of kindness, empathy, family, teamwork, using your talents, and helping others.

Barn Cat: A Counting Book,This book keeps readers counting and guessing.,"A welcome combination of rhyming verse and distinctive woodcuts, BARN CAT keeps readers counting and guessing what this single-minded cat is looking for. The farm setting works well for this simple math lesson, which is further reinforced by large numbers on the corner of each page.
 ","Award-winning artist Mary Azarian's bold, lush woodcuts sing across the pages of this fun counting book. One full-page spread shows three monarch butterflies resting on purple flowers while the striped cat, with one eye open, spies on them.

Keeper of the Night,Girl's story following mother's suicide.,"In a series of short chapters, some only a few lines long, Isabel, a native of Guam, tells of the months following her mother's suicide. Holt's prose is fluid, and her treatment of the aftermath of suicide is sensitive and realistic.
","Holt's gentle prose, along with the somewhat dark and affecting subject matter, will not be to every young reader's taste. There's little action, and though the writing is simple, direct, and clear, the short, journal-like chapters make keeping track of the narrative a challenge for inexperienced readers. But children with a taste for stepping into another world will find Isabel a sympathetic character, and the setting unique and vivid.
In a series of short chapters, Isabel tells of the months following her mother's suicide. It's left to Isabel to take care of her disturbed siblings and to try to understand why her mother didn't want to live. Lest this sound like all gloom and doom, though, Isabel's difficulties weave through a life that, while not exotic, is different enough to be fascinating. Kimberly Willis Holt details the rituals, family relationships, foods, and festivals of small-town Guam, and Isabel befriends an American girl whose life and attitudes are contrasted with Isabel's.","Parents need to know that despite the subject matter, this is not a wrenching book -- poignant, but not devastating.

Her selfish sister, Myrtle, is punished with bugs and snakes coming out of her mouth. But Ethelinda's plans backfire when Myrtle uses her affliction to force townspeople to give her whatever she wants, while Rosella is married to a greedy prince who only loves her jewels.
","The author's light sense of humor and deadpan descriptions of absurdities, along with the short length and easy-to-read text, make this a delightful snack rather than a heavy meal. But she never talks down to her audience, which makes this a good choice for young readers, reluctant readers, and reading aloud. This is the first of The Princess Tales, a series of short retellings of fairy tales by the Newbery-honored author of Ella Enchanted. Some may find the values here a little questionable: Myrtle's outrageous behavior is never punished, bringing success to her and her nasty mother. She even helps Rosella deceive the prince to get him to behave somewhat better, but he still gets to keep half of the jewels Rosella produces, while she gets to give the rest to the poor. But it's all meant in fun, and it's unlikely any young readers will take Myrtle as their role model.","Parents need to know that the behavior of both sisters is filled with points for discussion, as the bad sister gets what she wants through blackmail, and the good sister marries a man she does not love.

Confessions of a Shopaholic,Chick-lit fave gets a movie tie-in.,"The first in a series, CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC is getting a new marketing push because it's now a movie starring Isla Fisher (out February 2009). Becky Bloomwood is so far in debt she dreads opening her mail, but her answer to everything is to shop. It would be a waste of money not to take advantage of a good sale, right? Her job as a financial reporter for a British magazine called Successful Saving doesn't pay much, so Becky has two choices: stop spending as much money, or find a way to make more. When option one turns out to be a bust, she's determined to increase her fortunes, whether through a second job or a rich husband. She'll show that insufferable-but-handsome Luke Brandon she's not the inconsequential airhead he thinks she is.
","This book is not for readers who don't know Gucci from Prada. Becky's shallow obliviousness can grow tedious after a while, but her funny charm is endearing nonetheless. The many odes to shopping are balanced by hilarious scenes such as a job interview where Becky gets caught for lying on her resume (she says she speaks Finnish -- and it just so happens the company has new Finnish clients they want her to meet!).  Asking for realism in a chick-lit novel is like expecting a low-fat eclair -- Becky's solution to her financial problems could only happen in fiction -- but Kinsella keeps Becky grounded enough that readers care even when she's over the top. Teens may not understand all the British financial references, especially in the second half (and indeed, Becky herself barely does, either), but they are crucial to the plot. Knowing the exchange rate for pounds to dollars will help translate Becky's debt into its true horror.","Parents need to know that, as the title suggests, this book features rampant consumerism; it describes shopping trips the way a chef might wax eloquent about a gourmet meal or an artist rhapsodize about a masterpiece. The main character, Becky, is shallow and self-absorbed, though by the end she's a little less so. There are several references to adults drinking and sex (nothing explicit). It's implied that couples have sex by the third date.

Market Day,Presents folk art to young kids.,"South American wooden fish and fruit, clay jalopies and carts, papier-mache, vegetables, folk figurines, and pounded tin stars fill the pages of this bright, rhyming story about market day. The folk art photographed for the illustrations is fascinating, but its complexity may confuse young readers.
 ","Lois Ehlert used her own collection of folk art to accompany her lovely rhyming text about going to market. The first scene of a wooden Guatemalan rooster and chickens appliqued on a Colombian cloth field is charming. Unfortunately, too many of the scenes feel crammed with art, and even the balanced pages present a visual dilemma for children. Because the illustrations are photographs of authentic but unrelated folk objects, nothing is in proportion to each other.
MARKET DAY makes an important contribution by presenting folk art to young children. The explanation of origins and materials used, however, probably will fascinate grown-ups more than kids. Children will be disappointed by the lack of main characters, unless they notice the four repeating clay Mexican figurines, which often are hard to find.","Parents need to know that there is nothing objectionable in this busy, collaged book.

Blue Like Friday,Quirky friends make this sweet story soar.,"Olivia and her friend Hal -- a quirky boy who has synesthesia, which makes him say things like Friday is ""a light, pretty blue. With frills"" -- decide to play a prank on Hal's mother's boyfriend, hoping to break them up. But there are complications -- and they begin to worry about what happened to him. Life becomes more stressful when Hal's mother doesn't return from her outing -- for several days.
","This book manages to be both funny and heartwarming, without ever being cloying. This is mainly due to the sweet friendship between offbeat Olivia and even more eccentric Hal. (""Hal is like a little white mouse with a twitchy nose. You can't help liking him, even if the twitch drives you mad."") Readers may have a hard time believing how worked up Hal and Olivia get over his missing stepfather. It's also sort of surprising that Olivia waits several days before telling her mother that Hal's mother has disappeared, especially since Hal is so distraught over it. Kids may find the answers to both missing-person crises a bit anticlimactic, though the easy answers -- and Hal and Olivia's inability to sort them out -- do say something about their childlike thinking. It might have been worthwhile if Hal's synesthesia had worked more into the plot. As it is, his condition is more of a marker of just how unusual he is. 
But, these are just small criticisms. Readers will be touched by how vulnerable Hal and Olivia can be with each other. In one scene, he bursts into tears in front of her because he is so relieved his mother is OK; in another, she tells him she loves him, knowing he wasn't going to worry that she was ""proposing to him or anything."" In the end, it's impossible not to like Hal and Olivia, and to be moved by their sweet, small story.","Parents need to know this story focuses on a girl and her best friend, a boy who has synesthesia (which means when a certain sense is activated, another is activated at the same time).

Very young kids might be frightened by images of a zombie with a detached eye and a severed foot, as well as a skeleton who keeps falling apart (literally). But the overall mood is fun and festive.

El Deafo,"Charming, funny comics memoir of growing up deaf.","A bout with meningitis at age 4 leaves Cece with impaired hearing. As she goes off to first grade, she wears the Phonic Ear, a giant hearing aid strapped to her chest. Although she can understand some conversations, she still misses a lot of what's being said by those around her. She wants nothing more than to have a best friend, but can the Phonic Ear provide a way to find one?
","Funny, perceptive, and truthful, EL DEAFO expertly captures the experience of wanting to fit in and find a best friend, whether you're deaf or can hear perfectly. Young Cece is a hugely likable main character, alternately feisty and insecure, engrossed in her fantasy life while attuned to the pitfalls of reality. Cartoonist Cece Bell may use anthropomorphic rabbits as stand-ins for her characters, but their humanity shines through on every page.","Parents need to know that 2015 Newbery Honor Book El Deafo by Cece Bell is a sweet, funny, and affecting graphic memoir of growing up with a hearing impairment. From kindergarten onward, Cece wants a best friend to call her own, but her deafness and feelings of insecurity sometimes get in her way.

How to Take the Ex Out of Ex-boyfriend,Hijinks ensue as goofy girl schemes for her man.,"When Giovanna's twin brother decides to take on the school's popular clique and run for student body president, she knows she has to support him. So she does -- by dumping her boyfriend Jesse when he signs on as the rich, popular kid's campaign manager.
A few disaster blind dates later, and it's clear the break-up was a mistake. Can she win Jesse back -- and save her brother's doomed campaign? It's going to be a bumpy ride for emotional Giovanna -- who's prone to making embarrassing mistakes.
","It's easy for readers to relate to ""emotional"" Giovanna: This book is full of disasters, from bad blind dates to a really bad party, all played for laughs. Really, funny is pretty much all this book has going for it. Giovanna's relationship with Jesse -- which she ends in a passionate moment and quickly regrets -- is never really in jeopardy (they continue flirting/fighting until the book's inevitable romantic conclusion). Other storylines, such as Giovanna's tense relationship with her stepmother or her mother's tragic death, aren't developed, and many of the secondary characters remain flat.
But in the end, this is good, clean fun with a happy ending for everyone. It's a fun enough summer read by the beach/pool/mall food court.","Parents need to know that this book is pretty clean. Passionate kisses aren't described beyond saying their power ""stopped time."" The twins don't serve alcohol at their party, but three drunk guys show up; Giovanna takes the responsibility to drive them home. Giovanna sometimes talks about how her mother's death took away some of Dante's spirit.

No Roses for Harry!,Everyone comes out a winner in delightful story.,"Who hasn't received a well-intentioned but totally inappropriate gift? Harry determines to lose the embarrassing rose-patterned dog sweater from Grandma, but his efforts are constantly thwarted, until he receives help from a loose stitch and a nesting bird. Marvelous illustrations keep kids giggling at fashion victim Harry even as they sympathize with his plight.
 ","Children approaching the peer-group and fashion-consciousness mode of preschool and first grade readily respond to this story, which safely and humorously displaces some of their concerns onto Harry. The old-fashioned style of the book (first published in 1958) doesn't seem to be a problem, and, for many grown-up readers, it's a bonus. Nostalgia-prone adults will love Graham's small town, where people dress up to go shopping and every little store has its resident pet.
Margaret Graham's deft rendering of Harry's features -- ears, eyes, tail, and posture -- eloquently convey Harry's dejection and shame when he finds himself mocked by his canine peers. Likewise, as his family searches fruitlessly for the missing sweater, Harry assumes a look of combined innocence and craftiness.","Parents need to know that the depictions of dogs, cats, birds, and insects, not to mention Harry himself, are a delight for both children and grown-ups. Harry goes to great lengths to try to ""lose"" an unwanted gift.

"Seeing Redd: The Looking Glass Wars, Book 2","More violent battles, less clever than the first.","Having defeated her evil aunt Redd in the previous book, Alyss hardly has time to settle into her rightful role as queen of Wonderland before she is beset on all sides. The king of Boarderland is scheming against her, Homburg Molly is kidnapped, and Hatter Madigan has disobeyed orders and may be a traitor.
Meanwhile, Redd is planning a new assault, and gathering a new army on Earth and in Boarderland, where she may be teaming up with the king. And she has discovered a way to enhance her powers of Black Imagination far beyond Alyss' own formidable White Imagination.
","The Looking Glass Wars was a terrifically original and thrilling new entry in the fantasy field; this second book suffers from the dreaded sophomore slump. Those who loved the first book will enjoy it well enough, but it doesn't have that thrill of the new; the clever literary playing with the Alice in Wonderland story that made the first book so much fun.
Instead we get nearly nonstop battles and scheming. Redd's sojourn on Earth, where she gathers the dregs of humanity (many of whom turn out to be exiled Wonderlanders) is amusing, and the climactic battle is epic and exciting. But there's a flatness to the proceedings that would seem to indicate an author who used much of his best ideas in the first book.","Parents need to know that this is a violent series, which, of course, is part of its appeal. There are many battles and deaths, and some gruesome moments with fingers bitten off. There's some drinking, cigarette smoking, and drug use.

Where the Mountain Meets the Moon,Chinese girl's Oz-like adventure begging to be read aloud.,"Minli is a young girl who is an only child in a very poor family in China. She helps her parents work hard in the fields all day long every day. At night her father loves to tell her stories, but her mother is full of sighs and complaints about their hard life. One day, to help find fortune for her beloved parents, Minli sets off to seek out a character from one of her father's tales known as the Old Man in the Moon. To find him, she must travel far away to the Never Ending Mountain. Along the way she meets a dragon who longs to fly, an orphaned shepherd boy, and a prince, and befriends them all. In return, they help her solve some riddles and help her find her way. In the meantime, Minli's parents are desperate for her return, but her father's stories and a talking goldfish help them cope, and Minli finds a different kind of fortune than she expected.
","This is a a beautiful book that is bound to become a classic. Lin's love of Asian culture is evident in her creation of vivid new folktales that are built into the narrative in such a way that they become a seamless part of the story and their messages are thus relevant and meaningful. Minli is a strong and lovable heroine that boys will enjoy as much as girls. This story has been called a Chinese Wizard of Oz, but in fact it has an even more timeless appeal and a universal story in the mother who wants more, the daughter who wants to repay her parents, the wise father, and the engaging characters she meets on her quest. The story also offers an elegant design with color illustrations and Asian graphic style that make the book itself a gem. Many children will read this book more than once, and it could well be one of your favorite Newbery books of all time.","Parents need to know that this is a charming fantasy with very low violence, making it a great family read-aloud for various ages. Minli's quest not only introduces her to many lessons about greed, but her mother also learns to value what is most important as she anxiously waits for her daughter to return.

Otis and the Scarecrow,Tractor reaches out to silent friend in tale of empathy.,"During the summer a new member of the farm shows up: It's a scarecrow who stands alone in the field and scares the crows away. Friendly tractor Otis and later his barnyard animal pals try to welcome him. But the scarecrow doesn't smile or say hello. By autumn, the scarecrow still keeps to himself as Otis and friends gather at the big apple tree and play the quiet game; whoever can outlast the others before cracking up or making a sound wins. One day, it stars to rain, and Otis thinks ""about how the scarecrow must feel"" being all alone among the pumpkins, and he chugs over to join him, then sits with him silently. The animals follow and are silent, too, until they can't be still any longer and start ""giggling, quaking, and laughing."" Otis thinks the scarecrow ""didn't look so lonely anymore, surrounded by friends.""
","OTIS AND THE SCARECROW is a quiet, gentle story, beautifully illustrated in gouache and pencil, with utumn scenes full of pumpkins and cornstalks in a mainly orange, tan, black, and white palette. Kids may learn empathy from watching  friendly Otis reach out to an outsider and may find something to relate to from their own classroom and playground experiences. But the subdued pace and lack of action may not be every kid's cup of tea.
Teachers could easily use this story to teach a lesson about empathy for those who, for whatever reason, are nonverbal or don't feel comfortable talking or joining in with the group. ","Parents need to know that Loren Long's Otis and the Scarecow, the fifth in the bestselling picture book series about Otis the tractor, is a low-key story that emphasizes empathy for an outsider. It's unusual in that one of the main characters, the inanimate scarecrow, doesn't speak and maintains a fixed expression. But friendly tractor Otis sill wants to reach out to him and let him know he's part of the farm family.

"Mr. Lemoncello's Great Library Race: Mr. Lemoncello's Library, Book 3",Kids battle fake-news-posting villains in exciting episode.,"Kyle Keeley (a typical kid with great gaming skills) and his brainiac friends are looking forward to MR. LEMONCELLO'S GREAT LIBRARY RACE, which is supposed to be just another outrageously cool contest to promote the wacky Mr. Lemoncello's latest game release. But the evil Krinkle Brothers, makers of the world's most boring games, have other (sneaky, rotten) plans. Soon the contest is about lots more than finding out facts about famous people -- it's about saving the reputation, and game empire, of Mr. Lemoncello himself!
","Maybe the best Lemoncello yet, with a gripping plot, wild inventions, sneaky villains, and clever tweens who put aside their differences and pool their talents to save their hero and his library. Author Chris Grabenstein is in top form as he packs the story with book references, problem-solving challenges, loony pronouncements by the wacky Mr. Lemoncello -- and, along the way, a detailed how-to for examining that internet news story you just read to see if it's real or fake, and who's trying to make you believe it. Sometimes, as the story teaches a skill or warns of a hazard, it adds a message or two on the side, as here, where one of the kids has a personal reason for knowing hasty generalizations are a bad idea:
""'Please,' said Abia. 'I beg of you: Do not go there.'
""'Go where?' said Elliott, sounding defensive.
""'Holding everybody in the state of Missouri responsible for the acts of two creepy old men.'
""'But it makes sense,' said Diane.
""'In the same way that it makes sense for the airport security screeners to give my father extra scrutiny every time he flies because his skin is brown and his first name is Muhammad?'""","Parents need to know that Mr. Lemoncello's Great Library Race is the third installment in best-selling author Chris Grabenstein's series aimed at showing kids the wonders of libraries. Like other books in the series, it's packed with book references, creative challenges, diverse characters, and over-the-top details (like a private jet shaped like a banana, or drone slippers that let the wearer fly). It's also a timely response to the growing problem of fake news and other internet falsehoods, offering a great how-to (disguised as a mystery adventure) for figuring out whether that shocking information you just read online has a shred of truth attached. A bit of fart humor (whoopee cushions play a minor role) and occasional butt/poop references aside, there's nothing to worry about here and a lot to like.

Ashlords,Alchemy and magical horses star in solid dystopian tale.,"ASHLORDS opens with Imelda, as she scatters components into the ashes of a phoenix horse before it's dawn rebirth. As a Dividian, the Empire's lowest social caste, Imelda can't afford to train regularly or enter races, but videos of her brilliant phoenix alchemy and wild riding tricks go viral and draw the attention of the Ashlords. They offer her a scholarship to participate in ""the Races,"" a brutal, multi-day race that riders generally train their whole lives for. Pippa, a famous amateur racer, is the favorite -- s the Ashlord daughter of former champions of the Races, it's in her blood to win. Adrian is a Longhand, a caste of violently repressed rebels, who's in the Races to begin a new revolution against the Ashlords. Told in the alternating points of view of these three characters, the elaborate pre-race ceremonies and violent nights of the Races as riders defend their phoenix ashes or seek to preemptively end the race for other entrants make for a fast-moving read. The context of the Races -- n empire on the verge of civil war -- raise stakes that aren't resolved, laying fertile ground for Book 2.
","This exciting fantasy featuring horses with phoenix powers and interesting characters is weighed down by the inclusion of too many ideas. The descriptions in Ashlords of phoenix horse alchemy, their deaths and rebirths, and the thrill of riding these magical creatures is beautifully portrayed. The tightly drawn world of the Races runs like a movie in the reader's mind. Imelda, Pippa, and Adrian have compelling motivations and conflicts. Their efforts to be better than the world expects of them are powerful.  Reintgen falters in world building and included several confusing story elements. The Dividians were failed invaders -- that's why the Ashlords oppress them -- but it's a mystery that the Dividians stayed in the Empire at all. Overlaying racial and class differences on this already complicated society means it's difficult to draw parallels to the world we live in now. There are also gods who favor the oppressive Ashlords and enslave spirits in the afterlife, but readers never learn why on either account. This book is a mixed bag -- an entertaining read that leaves the reader with lots of questions. Luckily for readers who get hooked, there'll be a sequel.","Parents need to know that Scott Reintgen's Ashlords is the first book in a duology about phoenix horses who flame out at night and are reborn as the sun rises, as well as the young people who race them. Imelda, Pippa, and Adrian, have much to lose in the brutal, multi-day Races, and the stakes couldn't be higher: Escalated oppression and civil war threaten to sweep them up regardless of who wins. In a world that values success at any cost, characters struggle with betrayal, what it means to do the right thing, and loyalty to community, family and self. Characters represent a variety of skin colors, described variably as ""dark-skinned,"" ""pale,"" and ""golden."" Very mild when it comes to sex (a couple of quick kisses) and language (""fool,"" jackass""), this book delivers on violence. Characters use guns, swords, switches, batons, and poison to injure or kill, but the violence is not excessively gratuitous or gory. The unique conception of phoenix horses, the alchemy that lends them different powers upon rebirth, a touch of blood magic, and a complex politics mean this action-packed tale will appeal to a variety of readers.

The Sledding Hill,Ghost boy tells the story of a book-banning.,"Eddie has a lot to deal with. His father and his best friend, Billy, are both killed accidentally within a month, and Eddie is the one who finds both bodies. Now he's being haunted by Billy, who's lso the narrator of the story. His mother is being drawn further in to a fundamentalist church, led by Reverend Tarter, who's lso an English teacher at Eddie's school and is trying to manipulate Eddie into joining the saved, while working with his congregation to get a book banned at school. That book, Warren Peece, is a made-up book by the real author of this book, Chris Crutcher, who becomes a character in his own book when he gets involved in the effort to stop the banning. And that book happens to be the only meaningful thing Eddie has found to help him deal with his grief. So Eddie, though he hasn't spoken since he found Billy's body, is determined to save the book, and to take down the reverend at the same time.
","This story of a book-banning makes a provocative case for freedom, but sometimes the characters seem to act s the author's mouthpiece. The Sledding Hill is a diatribe cloaked in humor, a mostly enjoyable read that addresses a compelling issue in a way that will get kids talking.
In real life, Chris Crutcher's books have been the target of censorship efforts, and here he takes on would-be book-banners directly by writing a book in which they will find no bad language, sex acts, or violence, but the content is designed to be objectionable to them anyway. ","Parents need to know that The Sledding Hill, by Chris Crutcher, deals with the death of a parent and a best friend, racism, the separation of church and state, religious zealots, and book censorship in schools.

Unpregnant,Road-trip-to-abortion tale is touching comedy of errors.,"In UNPREGNANT, Veronica Clarke is the picture of high-school perfection: valedictorian candidate, dating the cutest guy in school, on the homecoming court, and hangs out with a clique of popular girlfriends. The polished exterior gets scratched when she discovers she's pregnant, even though she and her boyfriend use condoms. She's on track to attend Brown University on a scholarship -- she's the first in her family to go to college -- and she's terrified the pregnancy will derail her life. Because strict abortion laws have shut down minors' access to abortion clinics in her home state, she calls on former friend Bailey Butler to help her drive 1,000 miles to the nearest clinic where she can get one legally without her parents knowing about it. The two spend the trip confronting their broken relationship while dodging shady characters, getting into trouble, and learning some harsh truths about themselves
","This touching road-trip tale of a girl seeking an abortion takes a lighthearted approach to some tough topics. The authors of Unpregnant, Jenni Hendriks and Ted Caplan, mostly succeed in setting serious topics such as unwanted pregnancy, abortion, trust, broken friendships, and high school stress in a comedic setting. The end result is a mostly fun but shallow take on these issues. The road-trip aspect of the story is enjoyable. It has lots of twists, turns, dangers, and laughs while also giving Veronica and Bailey time together to work out their problems. The two are stereotypical good-girl and social-outcast characters. Veronica is the perfect, pretty, high-achiever, and Bailey is the odd, friendless, scary kid at school. Veronica's story highlights the problem with working so hard to keep up appearances. She's actually lonely and isolated because she thinks sharing her problems will tarnish her perfect image. Bailey's story shows how some people choose to isolate themselves socially because they're afraid of getting hurt. Both characters have good emotional development throughout the book.
However, issues of teen pregnancy and abortion -- the book's main plot point -- isn't discussed in the depth it could have been. Veronica does confront her Christian upbringing and previous thoughts on abortion, but the girls' friendship is more central to the story. Even though most of the book's topics are handled well by the authors, the behavior of Veronica's boyfriend is an exception. His actions are played for laughs too many times, when in real life he could be considered dangerous.","Parents need to know that Unpregnant is a funny road-trip story of teen girls on a wild car ride from Missouri to New Mexico so one of them can get an abortion. High school senior Veronica has a seemingly perfect life, but the future she wants for herself is threatened when she discovers she's pregnant. Afraid to let people in her life know what's going on, she turns to her ex-best friend and social outcast, Bailey, to take her to the closest abortion clinic, 1,000 miles away. The two go on a secret road trip and along the way engage in questionable behavior: breaking rules, lying, stealing, drinking, and smoking pot. The characters talk frankly about abortion, and the main character’s friend makes lots of jokes to her about it. Decisions around unplanned pregnancy, teen sex, and facts about abortion laws factor into the story, providing discussion opportunities for families. Other worthwhile discussion topics include the stress of trying to live up to high expectations, how to make good decisions, the downside of trying to create a carefully curated image, and issues of trust in all types of relationships.

Molly McGinty Has a Really Good Day,Molly takes her eccentric grandma to high school.,"Molly, who lives with her eccentric grandmother, Irene, keeps her whole life organized in a binder. So when that binder disappears she is thrown for a loop, especially since today is Senior Citizen's Day at her Catholic school, and Irene is the only grandparent to accept the invitation. Tripping and giving herself a black eye gets the day off to the kind of start Molly expected without her binder, but it's going to get worse. Much worse.
","Unbelievably prolific, Newbery-honored author Gary Paulsen can toss off a slight little thing like this with one hand tied behind his back, and probably did. It's mildly amusing, not very believable, and drills home his debatable, rather stereotypical Message -- that being organized and enjoying life are incompatible. This has been done many times before, and better.
The book's size and cover art make it look like a transitional story for second- or third-graders, but its tale of middle school crushes, delinquents, rebellion against authority, poetry slams, and The Message is aimed at older kids. Perhaps it would work for the high-interest, low-vocabulary crowd, but it doesn't seem powerful enough to grab the interest of a reluctant reader.

Not Just a Witch,Magic and humor mix with dark details for strange brew.,"Heckie has just graduated from Good Witch school with the power to turn humans into animals (using her Knuckle of Power and Toe of Transformation), and she is determined to Do Good. Unfortunately she and her best friend, Dora Mayberry, have a terrible quarrel at graduation, so she is on her own. Moving to a small town to make the world a better place, Heckie gathers a group of children and other witches to help her find bad people who deserve to be turned into animals. But when an unscrupulous furrier discovers her power, he charms and deceives her into a scheme to turn prisoners into snow leopards for fur coats.
","Eva Ibbotson is loved by her many fans for her lighthearted fantasies filled with amusingly eccentric characters, usually adults, and this one fits the form. And there are some creative turns -- and hilarious moments (such as when the Heckie's half-dragon/ half-worm tells her how much he hated his aquatic life, before he was transformed, ""Being a duck was the most boring thing that ever happened to me."") But young readers drawn in by the witchy-premise might be confused by the mix of magic with all-too-real crimes, such as abuse of old people and animals.
Ibbotson's bizarre sense of humor has been compared, with justification, to Roald Dahl's, which sometimes bothered adults even as it delighted children. But there is a big difference between the ridiculous unreality of James' parents being killed by an escaped rhino, and the all-too-real scene in this book when one of the children is found after having been beaten into bloody unconsciousness by the adult villain. ","Parents need to know that the younger readers might be sucked in by the title and fun premise here -- but the author mentions a number of fairly brutal crimes, which makes this book a better fit for older kids. One pretty major character is found beaten and bloodied by an adult, while a girl remembers her cousin beaten by white supremist thugs, for example. The witches at the heart of this story, Heckie and Dora, try to do the right thing, and ultimately learn to use their powers in gentle ways. They also model some lovely lessons about forgiveness and the strength of true friendship.

"Island of Fire: The Unwanteds, Book 3","Magic, mystery, mayhem, and a leadership message for tweens.","ISLAND OF FIRE begins right at the edge of the cliff where Book 2, Island of Silence, left off. Artime has lost all its magic, and the Unwanteds find themselves in a very desolate, bleak situation with little hope of survival ... that is, unless Alex can figure out how to restore the world they once knew. All he has to help him is a mysterious clue on a scrap of paper, one of Mr. Today's cloaks, and the support of his few remaining friends. On top of that, his friends Lani and Samheed have disappeared (captured on Warbler Island), Megan has reappeared but wearing a necklace of thorns that has taken her voice, all the magical creatures have turned to stone, and Simber lies at the bottom of the sea. Also, Quill is still a threat, and, its leader, Alex's evil twin brother, Aaron, has gained even more power. Finally, after a frustrating struggle, and due to some pretty amazing teamwork, Alex does discover the key to decoding the message, but only to face one new challenge after another as he attempts to grow into the role of mage that he has reluctantly accepted. And the adventure's not over yet.
","Readers may find Island of Fire a bit different from the previous books in the series: a little less magical, with more emphasis on the frustrating obstacles that follow one after another. But, what may be lost in magical fantasy is gained in breathless adventure. Kids will love following  Alex, Sky, Sean, Lani, Sam, and the other Unwanteds as they form a strong team, unafraid of tackling each challenge and working together with the magical creatures of Artime to fight the evil forces, rescue their friends, and rebuild their community. And they will appreciate the message, common to each book in this series, that creative, democratic community is a healthier place than one that exerts a tight control over its people and rules through fear and enforced silence.  Anyone who was hoping that this book would be the final solution to Artime's problems may be disappointed that it ends with another cliff-hanging episode. Other fans will be celebrating, knowing they'll soon be reaching for Book 4. ","Parents need to know that Island of Silence is the third book in the Unwanteds series, following Island of Silence, and will only make sense if kids have read the first two books. However, middle grade readers who have been waiting for it will not be disappointed. Like the earlier books, this one is packed with adventure, challenges, unexpected twists and turns, and a plethora of strong, heroic characters, both male and female. Creativity, community, and courage are valued; pettiness and rigid control in the face of fear aren't. The gently developing complexity in relationships between a couple of the main characters seems honest and real. A few frightening images, like  dark caves and the orange-eyed creatures, add a sprinking of terror. And there's some violence: A couple of kids are punched and kicked, a couple endure the implantation of a necklace of thorns and are temporarily blinded, other people are enslaved, tied up in closets, and/or sent off to the ""Ancient's Sector,"" to their deaths, and Alex and his friends fight the Quillean soldiers with magic.

"Sent: The Missing, Book 2","Intriguing premise, but too much exposition.","At the end of Found, Alex and Chip discover they are really princes from the Middle Ages, and they are returned there just in time for their murders, with Jonah and Katherine tagging along to try to prevent them. But messing with history is tricky business, especially when you're not all that clear on what is supposed to happen, and when the central event is, in fact, an historical mystery. Jonah and Katherine must find a way to let the princes die while saving their friends -- who do not want to be saved.
","The first book in The Missing series, Found, was a page-turning suspense thriller; this second book has moments of that too, but they are broken up by lengthy exposition. Given the obscure (for children) historical setting and the importance of the real events to the plot, some exposition was certainly necessary, but author Margaret Haddix, who is brilliant at suspense, is less successful here, with explanations that are sometimes confusing and go on too long.
	Nevertheless, that very complex and mysterious historical context gives this novel its fascination. It's like a deeper and more serious version of the '80s TV series Voyagers!, in which history must be corrected. Time travel, suspense, and deeply researched and thought-out historical complexity are a potent combination, and with 36 children trapped out of their times, this series should have a future nearly as long as its past.","Parents need to know that the story centers on a possibly true historical murder of two children, which is depicted, though not graphically, in the story.

Rainbow Magic Series,Friends' fairy adventures are fun intro to fantasy.,"The RAINBOW MAGIC SERIES follows best friends Kirsty Tate and Rachel Walker, tweens who first meet during family vacations to Rainspell Island, where they help Ruby the Red Fairy and get involved in the first of many adventures to come. In each set of seven books in the series, the two girls meet a new group of seven fairies, all of whom have something in common (rainbow magic, weather magic, party magic, flower magic, and so on) nd all of whom are somehow at risk of losing their magic because of a plot by the mean Jack Frost, who's usually motivated by a feeling such as jealousy or greed. The fairies (who are led by King Oberon and Queen Titania) recruit Kirsty and Rachel for help, typically in the form of recovering some kind of magic item that's also the target of Jack Frost's minions, the bumbling goblins. Inevitably, the girls face some kind of challenge or peril, think quickly to save the day, and help restore peace to Fairyland ... until the next time the magic finds them.
","This series won't win any awards for originality -- once you've read one of these books, you've pretty much read all 200+ -- but it's a sweet, fun introduction to fantasy for young children. The dangerous situations and quickly resolved cliffhangers are both fast-paced enough to keep kids interested and mild enough to ensure that those who aren't ready for anything edgier won't get too stressed about what's going to happen to Kirsty and Rachel. There's a somewhat stereotypically ""girly"" focus on fashion (the outfits of Rachel, Kirsty, and the fairies are always carefully described), but at least the fairies have a wide range of hair and skin colors and clothing styles.
If you're reading these aloud to your kids, once you're used to the books' pattern, you may find your mind wandering to bigger-picture questions -- just how many weeks off school do these girls have, anyway? And why aren't there any boy fairies? -- but as series for young readers go, Rainbow Magic is a fine choice. It's not a problem to read the different subsets of books out of order (any references made to other adventures are quick and in passing), and it's possible that a little fairy magic could encourage kids on the verge of ""real"" reading to make the final leap, which is always a good thing.","Parents need to know that the Rainbow Magic series is made up of several smaller sets of seven adventures, for a total of more than 200 individual books. Each story follows best friends Kirsty Tate and Rachel Walker as they help their fairy friends resolve a problem involving bad guy Jack Frost and his goblin minions. Each story follows best friends Kirsty Tate and Rachel Walker as they help their fairy friends resolve a problem involving bad guy Jack Frost and his goblin minions. Though the stories are all pretty similar, they're a fine introduction to fantasy adventures for young kids; there's always some kind of suspense or mild peril, but it's always resolved quickly and painlessly. And Kirsty and Rachel are model tweens -- respectful, polite, helpful, and clever (they usually use their brains to outwit the bad guys, rather than brawn) -- who value their friendship and their secret alliance with the fairies. These books are great for read-aloud.

"Witherwood Reform School, Book 1","Creepy school holds kids captive in dark, funny fantasy.","Ever since their mother died, 12-year-old Tobias and 11-year-old Charlotte Eggers have been stuck with one horrible governess after another rather than being cared for by their father, who isn't coping too well. When a dire prank on the governess takes a worse turn, their dad's had it -- and he dumps them in the middle of the rainy night at the gates of WITHERWOOD REFORM SCHOOL. He doesn't really mean to leave them there for long, but his plans go awry, and soon the terrified but resourceful kids are imprisoned by toothy creatures and creepy adults in this strange academy -- not for long, if they can help it.
","Kids who have a hard time seeing the funny side of emotionally harrowing situations, from scary monsters to mourning and parental abandonment, might want to pass on this book. But readers steeped in Neil Gaiman and Lemony Snicket will find Witherwood Reform School a fast, entertaining read. Some will gripe that very little is resolved at the end of this volume, which is largely a setup for future installments. Keith Thompson's appealing illustrations bring the characters and their predicaments to life.","Parents need to know that there's plenty of cartoonish creepiness in Obert Skye's latest series start, and sensitive readers may be more appalled than entertained by this variation on the Hansel and Gretel theme. The 11- and 12-year-old sibling protagonists get dumped at the gates of a spooky house in the dead of night by their own father, fter the kids send live tadpoles to an awful doom by putting them in their horrid governess's food. Monsters, locked rooms, dark hallways, dramatic reversals, and zombie-like characters abound, and there's n evil headmaster who keeps everyone in line with mind control.

Beauty and the Beast: Lost in a Book,Belle gets lured into book in dark but enchanting spin-off.,"In BEAUTY AND THE BEAST: LOST IN A BOOK, Love and Death, two sisters who are eternally at odds, make a wager that Belle will abandon the Beast before the enchanted spell in his castle can be dissolved. Defying her oath not to cheat, Death creates a magical book to draw Belle closer to her so that she might win the bet. Belle loves to read nd has been given the keys to the Beast's extensive library. All the characters from the movie (Lumiere, Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, and Chip -- the servants-turned-household items) treat her lovingly s she passes her days in captivity. But Belle is troubled by the Beast's withdrawn and quick-to-anger behavior. She longs for a different life. The magical book might just offer her the perfect escape.
","Well-crafted and enchanting, this Disney confection offers  fascinating escape with some spooky twists. Lost in a Book lets fans of the Beauty and the Beast movies delve further into Belle's magical world. This book-within-a-book reads a lot like a Disney movie feels, with its descriptive fantasy world patterned in colorful prose. The well-read observer (bookworm lert!) will recognize the Shakespeare quotes with as much glee as Belle recites them. Someone new to Shakespeare, Spenser, and various Greek myths, might be encouraged to seek out these literary gems, if only to get closer to Belle, who is so bookish and smart that she takes on more depth in this depiction.
As book-smart as she is, Belle has difficulty dealing with the Beast's tantrums. She stands up to him and encourages him to laugh at himself, but is this cycle of bad behavior and reconciliation  healthy one? Lessons of compassion and courage re one thing, but getting into a relationship with someone who lashes out and can't take responsibility for unacceptable behavior is another. This book's weakness is the Beast's weakness; it's not sure how to solve the tantrum issue. But it does offer a lovely escape, which is exactly the point.","Parents need to know that Jennifer Donnelly's well-written fantasy novel Beauty and the Beast: Lost in a Book plays off Disney's 2017 live-action Beauty and the Beast movie. It's a gothic tale in which Belle is caught in a scheme devised by a character named Death, who places a deadly bet with her sister, Love, that Belle will abandon the Beast. Death conjures a living book, utterly entrancing Belle, luring her closer to her own demise. Elements of Death's plot are creepy and graphic, such as zombie marionettes who try to trap Belle. The Beast's tantrums, in which he breaks things, threatens to hurt people, and abandons Belle or traps her, are frightening. Belle does stand up for herself, but her circumstances really don't lend her much support, safety, or freedom.

"Found: The Missing, Book 1",Time-travel series start is suspenseful.,"Neighbors Jonah and Chip, both 13 and both adopted, both receive anonymous letters telling each that he is ""one of the missing,"" and warning them of unspecified danger. After some investigation, they find that they were two of 36 babies found on a mysterious airplane that appeared, and then disappeared, at the airport 13 years earlier. Now they are being stalked by threatening men who can vanish at will, and who may be able to travel through time.
","This has all the qualities of a B movie: hokey dialogue, not entirely believable characters, and a science fiction premise where the science doesn't make a whole lot of sense. But, like a B movie, you won't care while you're reading it -- it's just too suspenseful and exciting. This is your classic can't-put-it-down, read-under-the-covers, when's-the-next-one-coming-out thriller.
Margaret Peterson Haddix, author of the popular Shadow Children series, knows a thing or two about suspense, such as how to maintain it without a lot of the usual fighting, battles, and near-death experiences that most authors seem to think are necessary. Of course she uses the usual tricks of the trade: chapter-ending cliffhangers, creepily mysterious events, gradual revelation of dire secrets, and general air of foreboding. But she uses all that in the service of a radically original and intriguing (if still somewhat fuzzy) premise. The cliffhanger ending will have kids panting for the next one.","Parents need to know that there's little to be concerned with here: some brands are mentioned, there's some mild fighting and use of a Taser.

Dreamdark Series,Exciting faerie series with a fantastic tomboy heroine.,"This series centers on the world of faeries at an age when ""mannies"" are plentiful and faerie civilization is on the decline. All seven Djinn who created the world (all but the mannies), in a deep sleep hidden throughout the world, are allowing the decline to continue. That is until a faerie sprout named Magpie Windwitch, who for years had been on devil-capturing quests with a gaggle of crows, decides to wake the Djinn King in order to stop a powerful devil named the Blackbringer from taking over her native Dreamdark. She must convince him that faeries are worth saving before she can conquer the devil and find the other Djinn.
","Magpie is a fantastic heroine -- the ultimate scrappy tomboy, resourceful, brave, and kind of quirky. The intro to the series bogs down occasionally with detail in this richly envisioned faerie world (complete with art from the author), but the writing is so engaging readers will hardly notice. Once the action ramps up and the true nature of the hiddeous Blackbringer is established, readers will be racing to finish and start the next one.
Whisper, a faerie who can weave silk with her voice, is escaping devils with a Djinn asleep in a lowly tea kettle. She tries to find passage across the mountains to safety and meets the champion Hirik, a brave but secret-laden faerie also after the Djinn, and redemption for his clan. The second installment is even more action-packed, with more devils to fight and more characters to root for. Also, heroism and strength come from unexpected places.","Parents need to know that this faerie series has fantasy violence that includes battles between faeries and creatures called devils, but, refreshingly, the faeries try to capture the devils, not kill them. In the first book a rather menacing devil called a Blackbringer sucks victims into an abyss. In Silksinger, a character is mutilated but later restored to his former self. There are some sad deaths, but because the main character can visit the Moonlit Gardens (faerie heaven), the characters are never really gone. Girls rule here, and young Magpie at the center of the series is a fierce, brave warrior who is also a great friend to her band of crows. Crows smoke frequently, and there's some swearing in faerie dialect that sounds quaint rather than crass.

Mapping the Bones,Twins' lives are torn apart in haunting Holocaust book.,"MAPPING THE BONES starts in 1942 in Poland with brother-and-sister twins who are barely surviving in the ghetto. Chaim is a poet who rarely speaks, and his sister, Gittel, recalls their story between chapters. They escape the ghetto and wander the wilderness, during nights ""filled with terror, the sound of gunshot, a scream, the gleam of knives, the creak of a door that should have been locked, the nightmare darkness that closes its cold hand around your throat."" This harrowing Hansel & Gretel tale is told through children's eyes, as they're held prisoner in a Nazi labor camp, trying to avoid the dangerous ovens looming on the horizon.
","This poetic, powerful story is disturbingly tragic and gripping. Mapping the Bones is not an easy read, but a compelling and necessary one. After the children escape the ghetto, they're separated from their parents and the story turns more graphic, as the second half of the book follows their capture by German soldiers and their struggles to survive in a labor camp, where they're subject to inhumane experiments.","Parents need to know that Mapping the Bones by Jane Yolen is a tragic, powerful story about a Jewish family that's been relocated to the Lódz ghetto in Poland during World War II, where they're stuffed into a small flat with another family. As the situation in the ghetto worsens, 14-year-old Chaim pawns his mother's engagement ring so that both families can escape into the forest and across the border into the Soviet Union. Gittel, Chaim's twin sister, recounts their harrowing journey in snippets several decades later. The violence becomes more graphic as the story progresses and the children are forced to live in a labor camp. There are mentions of death, children being tortured, and, of course, the Holocaust.

"Firebrand: Elemental, Book 2",Dystopian fantasy displays sharper edges in second volume.,"Having saved themselves at great cost from Roanoke Island's pirates in Elemental, Thomas and his fractious crew of friends and family members, now in the pirates' commandeered ship, still need a new place to call home. Using his newfound elemental powers on the ship's radio, Thomas hears a message urging all refugees to head to Fort Sumter. But as they head south, he and his crew discover their powers fading; by the time they reach the refugee colony, they fear its distrustful, rather sinister inhabitants. Is Fort Sumter the haven they've been searching for, or have they stumbled into an even worse predicament?
","A nonstop adventure fantasy with an intriguing near-future setting, FIREBRAND mixes history and fantasy to present a fresh take on the standard tropes of apocalyptic fiction. The series' second volume is a little harsher than the first in its presentation of violence, but not excessively so. The plot offers plenty of twists, as well as a deepening sense of the characters. Author Antony John inspires confidence that he'll be able to carry this saga to its conclusion with inventiveness and skill.","Parents need to know that Firebrand, the exciting second volume of a fantasy series set in a dystopian near future in North Carolina's Outer Banks, features pirates, a colony of treacherous refugees, and a group of survivors with the power to command the elements.

From George Washington to Barack Obama, every page presents an occupant of the White House -- all men, so far -- with his own story to tell, his own successes and failures, and his own way of looking at things.
","Historian Ken Burns and illustrator Gerald Kelley deliver young readers a visually engaging, information-rich introduction to U.S. presidents that invites lots of exploration and return visits. Whether you and your kids are history buffs (like Burns' daughters, who would exclaim ""Grover Cleveland, Again!"" when mentioning the only man to win and lose the presidency, then win it again) or prefer trivia and a good story, there's something here to appeal to just about everyone, send readers off on further explorations, and launch some interesting discussions.","Parents need to know that Grover Cleveland, Again! is noted historian Ken Burns' lively, age-appropriate introduction of United States presidents (from Washington to Obama) to young readers.

The Call of the Wild,Classic animal tale of dignity and survival.,"Buck is a large dog living the good life on a comfortable California estate in the 1890s when he's kidnapped and transported to the Yukon in Canada to be a sled dog during a gold rush there. At first he tries to rebel, but he is soon beaten into submission. As he passes through a succession of owners, he finds that ancient instincts from his wolf ancestors are awakening within him, enabling him to survive and prosper in the brutal wilderness of the North. It is a tale that is brutal at times but ultimately an uplifting story about inner dignity and what it takes to be a leader.
","THE CALL OF THE WILD is a great work of literature; there can be no doubt. Written in a style that is at once muscular and poetic, it is both an adventure story and a meditation on civilization vs. savagery, with savagery clearly having more appeal to the author. As Buck gradually reverts to the instincts and behaviors of his wolf ancestors, he becomes both more alive and more truly himself. This, and its implications for human beings, gives young readers plenty to think and talk about, which explains why this book continues to be a favorite for discussion groups and classrooms.
	There's a brutality here that not all children will find to their taste, and modern American children are more likely to want to discuss the way Buck is treated than the way he acts. The sensibilities that drove the author and his original audience have changed dramatically since the time this book was written, and animal rights and treatment are a hot topic with children these days. ""The law of club and fang"" is a long way from the experience of most modern young readers, who may not agree with author Jack London's view of the whole situation. This, of course, can also prompt interesting discussions, though they may be different from what the author was thinking of when he wrote it.","Parents need to know that Jack London's Call of the Wild, originally published in 1903, has moved kids for generations and is considered a great work of literature. Its fast-paced drama hooks even reluctant readers. That said, it also reflects the sensibilities of another age. This is a story of survival, which entails a great deal of brutality by and toward dogs. It may be a bit much for sensitive young animal lovers of today, when beating dogs with clubs is not considered an acceptable way of training them. Dogs fight each other to the death, and tear out the throats of dogs and men, yielding geysers of blood when the jugular is ripped open. Buck, the canine main character, is often beaten, once almost to death. But ultimately, this is a story of dignity and leadership that will grip kids and hold them.

It's used not only as a jump rope but also to secure possessions to the roof of a car that heads north, to dry flowers and diapers in a city apartment, and to help make new friends. The story is told from the point of view of a young girl, who relates the rope's history in her family and how it helped them realize their goal of having a better life.
","Together, author Jacqueline Woodson nd illustrator James Ransome have tackled a huge topic and made it accessible for young readers. Woodson uses spare, poetic text to show through a single family how hopes and dreams of a better life drove an estimated 6 million African-Americans in the 20th century to leave the rural South for new beginnings in northern cities.

How to Code a Sandcastle,Solid coding lessons fill fun tale of girl and her robot.,"In HOW TO CODE A SANDCASTLE, it's the last day of summer vacation, and Pearl's sandcastles keep getting destroyed -- by waves, by Frisbees, by dogs. So she decides to enlist the help of her robot friend, Pascal. ""He’ll do whatever I tell him -- as long as I tell him in CODE. It’s not secret code -- it’s special instructions that computers understand."" Pearl sequences the task, breaking the big problem into smaller ones, some of which she instructs him to repeat in a loop. Pascal doesn't always understand the instructions; when she sends him out to get decorations, he comes back with a baby's binky. So she creates if-then-else code that specifies the steps more clearly. At the end, they create a moat to protect the sandcastle, and use a loop code to create a whole kingdom.
","This sunny book delivers lots of fun along with its serious computer lesson: Coding's a day at the beach if you use it to build a sandcastle. How to Code a Sandcastle successfully introduces basic concepts by using coding language to demonstrate how to break a simple task into its component parts, which is a good life skill s well as a computer skill. Author Josh Funk includes plenty of humor. The main character's not daunted when a ""flying saucer"" (Frisbee) knocks over her castle, or when it gets an unintended moat (via dog pee). But the lessons aren't just breezy, they're solid, and the pages at the end explain the coding concepts of sequence, loop, and if-then-else more fully.
Illustrator Sara Palacios makes sure the crowd at this beach is racially diverse, with lots of African American beachgoers, and families that are racially mixed. Pearl, the narrator, is way cute in her heart sunglasses and springy pigtails, and Palacios cleverly works in illustrations of people absorbed in beach reading, with one newspaper sporting a propos headlines -- ""Programmer fixes bug!"" and ""Memory leak disaster!"" -- and a magazine with a photo of an African American subject. The lesson goes down as easily as a refreshing ice pop on a hot beach day, and it's just as welcome.","Parents need to know that How to Code a Sandcastle is by Josh Funk, a professional software engineer who also writes kids' books, and illustrated by Sara Palacios. The book's a collaboration with the nonprofit organization Girls Who Code, and opens with a note from the founder, cheering on the idea of familiarizing kids at any early age with basic coding concepts, the way you'd introduce ""animals, history, and space."" It uses a real-world application -- building a sandcastle -- to introduce the coding steps sequence, loop, and if-then-else, showing how to break the task into its component parts. The book works for all kids, but since the main character's a girl who's African American, it definitely welcomes girls and kids of color to the coding party.

The Thief Lord,A modern version of the shipwrecked story.,"After their mother's death, Prosper and Bo run away from their unpleasant aunt Esther, who plans to adopt Bo and send Prosper off to boarding school. Arriving in Venice they fall in with a small group of children who live in an abandoned theater and make a living by stealing, led by a boy who calls himself the Thief Lord.
	Tracked by an eccentric detective hired by their aunt, the children instead capture the detective and hold him prisoner while planning a theft, commissioned by a mysterious Conte, of a broken wooden wing that comes from a legendary, and possibly magical, carousel.
","The great popularity of this book with children is something of a mystery. It is very slow to get started, the fantasy element doesn't appear until the last 75 pages, there's little emotional involvement, and the rest of the story meanders as much as the winding canals of Venice. For adults, the story is also problematic -- none of the grownup characters ring true or behave like any adult you've ever met. And the amorality of the children, and the author, is a concern.
But perhaps that's what makes the book appealing to children: For them the fantasy begins long before the magic appears, with self-sufficient children and adults who let them be, crime without punishment, and complete freedom. Living on their own in a theater in Venice, with kindly adults around to care for them but not bother them or make them clean up and go to school, must seem like a magical fantasy to children whose lives are programmed and whose every waking minute is supervised.","Parents need to know that they might be bothered by the amoral attitude of the author toward the stealing by the main characters. Though Prosper disapproves, he participates. Also, Bo's aunt and uncle abandon him to an orphanage because he doesn't behave well, which some children may find disturbing, though it is mitigated by the fact that Bo doesn't want to stay with them either.

She also has to deal with the tragic shooting death of her brother, who had been her main support, and the pain of her father, who seems lost in grief over the killing of his son. Caitlin is intelligent, but ""getting it,"" that is, understanding emotion or interpreting social behavior, is almost impossible. She has to use her intellect, the Facial Expressions Chart, and much verbalizing to herself to get it right. The reader sees all this from within Caitlin's mind, and it could not seem more real. Finally, with the help of her very understanding school counselor, the friendship of a younger boy, and the kindness of one of her classmates, she breaks through, and begins to understand empathy. As Caitlin starts to ""get"" compassion, so do those around her.
","Author Kathryn Erskine does a wonderful job of getting into protagonist Caitlin's head and taking us with her in this sensitive, captivating book that's simply a great read.
The story is a bit complex. With the school shooting, her father's overwhelming grief, and the responsibility Caitlin feels for bringing the situation to some kind of closure for everyone around her, it risks being more contrived and complicated than it needs to be. However, the tone is so perfect and the protagonist's voice so strong that it all seems quite possible.","Parents need to know that this winner of the 2010 National Book Award for Young People's Literature is insightful, and imparts a hopeful message. Part of the story is about how the community copes with a shooting at Virginia Dare Middle School that took the lives of two students and one of their teachers. One student was brother to the main character, Caitlin, a 10-year-old girl on the autism spectrum, disgnosed at that time as Asperger's Syndrome. Also, it is written from the mind of Caitlin, with all her thoughts and confusions, so the book may be difficult to read aloud. But the book's message is a poignant one: Every character is trying to overcome grief, develop empathy, and show tolerance for others. Ultimately, the entire community learns that problems and frustrations can be avoided ""by getting inside someone's head"" to better understand  person.

Now, if Simon wants his sexuality to stay a secret, he must help that classmate try to hook up with a girl he likes. When Simon's secret inevitably comes out, he faces both positive and negative reactions from his friends, parents, and classmates, including some outright bullying at school. He also must figure out what to do about Blue, for whom he now has deep feelings -- and who now knows who he really is. ","Despite the rather devastating premise, SIMON VS.

Simon's coming-out story might not break new ground, but it's sweet and romantic. 
Also, Simon gains some surprising insights about himself and life, and readers will enjoy his ideas. For one, he thinks that all young people should have to come out about their sexuality, not just gay people. He also realizes the logic in what Blue tells him -- ""people really are like houses with vast rooms and tiny windows"" -- meaning he's not the only one with a secret identity nd that even the people he's closest to are getting over private pain or discovering new parts of their personalities.

Rani Patel in Full Effect,"Powerful coming-of-age tale deals with abuse, addiction.","RANI PATEL IN FULL EFFECT tells the story of 16-year-old Rani who lives on the Hawaiian island of Moloka'i with her Indian immigrant parents. Not only does she feel like an outsider at school, but her relationship at home is also strained. Her parents' arranged marriage is falling apart and Rani is expected to pick up the pieces, even though her mom barely talks to her and her dad sexually abuses her. When Rani sees her dad with another woman, she shaves her hair off like an Indian widow and writes a powerful slam poem detailing her pain, anger, and frustration. Her drastic change catches the attention of Mark, the hot older customer who often visits her family’s store, and she jumps headfirst into a relationship with him despite the warnings from her friends. But her introduction to 4eva FlowIn', an underground hip-hop crew, and some questionable decisions, give Rani and her mom the push they need to break free from the people and situations that cause them pain.
","Sonia Patel’s emotional and powerful coming-of-age novel tastefully tackles the trauma associated with abuse and addiction as well as the road to recovery. With a blend of diverse languages and cultures, numerous early ‘90s rap references, and Rani’s poetic lyrics, Rani Patel in Full Effect creates a vivid depiction of life on the island. As a trained psychologist, Patel understands the frustration readers may feel with Rani’s decisions and mistakes, but she acknowledges that it’s realistic for survivors of abuse.
Although Rani initially lacks self-confidence and has a skewed sense of self-worth, her alter ego MC Sutra is full of life and positive energy. Most teens will never experience anything like Rani’s story, but as she “strive[s] to be [her] own queen bee” and slowly learns she “don’t need your praise to phase how [she] self-appraise,” teens will understand that Rani’s story is one of perseverance and empowerment.","Parents need to know that Sonia Patel's Rani Patel in Full Effect is about a 16-year-old Indian-American girl who lives on the Hawaiian island of Moloka'i with her parents during the early '90s. A big fan of hip hop, Rani raps to escape her dysfunctional family, break sexist cultural traditions, and eventually find her voice and identity. Although this story can help teens can learn the importance of determining their own self-worth and the power of perseverance, parents should be aware that the book tackles mature topics including sexual abuse and addiction. Incest, rape, and domestic violence are large parts of Rani's story but aren't described in graphic detail. Several characters drink beer, tequila, and champagne as well as use drugs, including marijuana, crystal meth, heroin, and cocaine. Strong language includes frequent uses of ""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""ass,"" ""hell,"" ""bitch,"" ""bastard,""  insults ""slut"" and ""skank,"" nd more.

Freckleface Strawberry: Best Friends Forever,Unlikely duo finds true friendship in fun boy-girl tale.,"FRECKLEFACE STRAWBERRY: BEST FRIENDS FOREVER is about the friendship that develops between Freckleface Strawberry and Windy Pants Patrick after the dodgeball incident of the second book in this series. The two unlikely friends find they share so many things in common, especially because they feel so different from the other kids. However, the other girls think Freckleface should play with girls, not boys. And the boys feel Windy Pants should play with the boys. The duo tries it both ways, and discovers the friendship they share is a special one after all.
","Kids will love this latest Freckleface adventure, and grown-ups certainly will enjoy reading it aloud to them. It's a cute, funny story that carries another very positive message about learning to respect and tolerate each other's differences, even value them. Julianne Moore's narrative is entertaining and sweet, LeUyen Pham's illustrations are playfully expressive, and an important lesson is gently nudged along to the end. ","Parents need to know that Freckleface Strawberry: Best Friends Forever is the third of Julianne Moore's Freckleface series. It can stand alone, but will make even more sense after reading the first two books. The issue here is whether a girl and boy can be best friends, even when they share many things in common. And, do they have to share everything to be best friends? Also, though it's not really a big issue in the book, Windy Pants Patrick has two moms. Parents should be prepared to explain that to kids who ask.

Left Drowning,Really racy romance with explicit sex and not much else.,"Blythe has been a drunken and depressed mess since her parents died in a tragic fire four years ago, but when she meets Chris -- and his offbeat but incredibly close brothers and sister -- she begins to be able to remember what actually happened that night, and build a new, healthier life for herself that includes studying, running, and hanging out with friends. But while she and Chris share an incredible attraction, and even hook up one steamy night, he says he's not ready for a relationship with her. Blythe understands he has demons of his own, but she isn't sure he will let her in to his past, even after telling him, \""You saved me. And I wish that you would let me save you.\""
","Well, this isn't full of subtlety or complex characters; readers won't even get a real sense of Blythe, the protagonist, or why everyone seem to think she's so special. Chris' siblings -- including drama geek Sabin, tough-talking Jesus freak Estelle and her sweet gay twin, Eric -- come across as especially two-dimensional.
In the end, this is a book full of descriptive sex scenes, dramatic fights and revelations, and philosophical talk about fate vs. chance -- all held together by some pretty over-the-top plotting. (Because of their pasts, both Blythe and Chris are wealthy, so this drama often takes place in hotel suites or huge houses overlooking water). Really, really mature readers who like racy romances might appreciate that this book does include a positive message: With love and support (and in some cases, therapy), the characters learn to have happy lives despite awful, tragic pasts. ","Parents need to know that Left Drowning features many vivid descriptions of sex, including intercourse, oral sex, masturbation, and more, including a character who wants her boyfriend to hit her during sex. Blythe's parents died in a tragic fire, which she recounts in detail, and Chris details horrific abuse at the hands of his father who both physically and psychologically tortured his siblings and him (he was beaten by a mallet, forced to carry heavy objects, nearly drowned in a toilet, and more). There's plenty of mature language, and lots of drinking until drunkenness, including by the main character (who's of legal drinking age). Another character gets a DUI and later has to go to rehab to get his drinking under control.

"Lord of Shadows: The Dark Artifices, Book 2","Faeries, demons, kissing, with thoughtful look at prejudice.","In LORD OF SHADOWS, Shadowhunters at the LA Institute -- the Blackthorn family, Emma Carstairs and her friend Cristina -- thought they would finally have some peace with the murderous warlock Malcolm Fade gone, but unwanted visitors just keep coming. First it's massive, tentacled ocean demons invading the Santa Monica Pier, snatching tourists. Next it's dozens of Centurions, secretive and bigoted Shadowhunter soldiers there to investigate Fade's death. And then it's Gwyn, a faerie from the Wild Hunt who implores Mark Blackthorn to come rescue his old boyfriend from the land of faerie. The Unseelie faerie king is about to kill him. As Mark, his brother Julian, Emma, and Cristina sneak to the land of faerie on a rescue mission, things go very wrong at home. Under the Centurions' watch, Malcolm Fade emerges from the sea, zombie-like, demanding Blackthorn blood to raise his love, Annabel, from the dead.
","As always, fans will eat up this extra-large helping of this Shadowhunter saga with parts lovelorn melodrama, demon and undead fighting, and political turmoil. It's a curious combo that usually works well enough for author Cassandra Clare, but Lord of Shadows seems to have more passionate kissing and more anguished couples than usual. There's Emma and Julian, of course, but also Mark and Kieran, Mark and Cristina, and Cristina and Diego. Adding to the anguish is lots of unnecessary lying that only seems to serve to keep the melodrama high. Why wouldn't Emma tell Jules that they'd be cursed if they were together? Her reasoning doesn't seem solid.
But in between forbidden lip locks, a lot goes down. A trip to the land of faerie sets up so many fascinating complications: promises that will be nearly impossible to keep, a deranged undead ancestor the Blackthorns are now desperate to find -- and under that, the whole current of political upheaval among the Shadowhunters. Who will win out? In one corner: the scheming ban-and-register-all-Downworlders crowd. In another: those like the Blackthorns who have part-faerie siblings and a warlock as their best ally. If you take out the fantasy element, does any of this sound familiar?","Parents need to know that Cassandra Clare's Lord of Shadows is the second book in the Dark Artifices series and part of a much larger Shadowhunters franchise. It includes six books in the Mortal Instruments series that take place a few years before this series starts, three books in the Infernal Devices series that take place in the Victorian era, a movie (City of Bones), and a TV show (Shadowhunters). So most teen readers will already know quite a bit about this fantasy world full of Shadowhunters -- those with some angel blood who fight demons and sometimes faeries, warlocks, werewolves, and vampires. It helps to read the Mortal Instruments series before starting the Dark Artifices, but it isn't completely necessary. This series has always been for mature teen readers, because of both the level of violence and the sexual content. While Lord of Shadows isn't as gory as the first book, Lady Midnight, it still has its moments. Two shocking deaths by sword near the end will upset fans. There's much talk of gushing blood in general: A sword comes free in a ""gout of blood"" after a faerie is killed, a throat is slit in a voluntary sacrifice, a wrist is sheared off and thumps to ground still holding a sword, and a faerie is beheaded, with talk of another severed head put in a bag. Other mature content includes sex between older teens (which is barely described) and much passionate kissing among straight and LGBTQ couples. Older teens and adults drink wine. Author Clare is known for her diverse characters and adds more to this series. Ty is on the autism spectrum, and another character is transgender; both are treated with respect and understanding by those closest to them.

Dodger,Clever adventure depicts Victorian streets with sly humor.,"On the streets of London, 17-year-old street urchin Dodger witnesses the escape attempt of a badly beaten young woman and rushes to her rescue. With the help of journalist Charlie Dickens, Dodger gets Simplicity, as the unknown girl chooses to call herself, to relative safety. But it soon becomes clear that her former captors will stop at nothing to get her back. It will take every bit of Dodger's street wisdom -- plus assistance from the likes of politician Benjamin Disraeli and London police founder Robert Peel -- to effect a permanent solution that will save Simplicity's neck and not plunge England into war.
","Mixing characters from fiction with real-life historical figures, DODGER is a captivating Victorian adventure that's sure to please both fans of Oliver Twist and casual readers. Author Terry Pratchett employs a narrative voice that's perfectly pitched to the material and which offers many sly pleasures. The plot is full of suspense and twists, but Dodger often works best in its smaller moments, when the characters stop their machinations and reveal their true selves.
Slightly older teens already familiar with the setting will enjoy a richer experience with the novel's many literary and historical allusions, but Dodger can be enjoyed by wide range of readers.","Parents need to know that 2013 Printz Honor Book Dodger is a clever, fast-moving, funny, and suspenseful historical adventure set in the streets and sewers of Victorian London. The main character, Dodger, has a reputation as a thief, but his heart is definitely in the right place. There's some violence, including the kidnapping and beating of a young woman and an encounter with a crazed barber, but it's neither graphic nor gratuitous. The characters and the narrator sometimes employ vulgar terms for excrement and body parts (""shite,"" ""arse""), along with a few instances of ""piss,"" ""bastard,"" ""damn,"" and ""hell."" Dodger shares a few kisses with his lady love, but the two are well-chaperoned. Having children out of wedlock is mentioned, as is the fact that poor, desperate girls sometimes turn to prostitution to survive. In general, the novel presents a realistic portrait of its era.

"""When Did You See Her Last?"": All the Wrong Questions, Book 2","More playful sequel, even as menace and mystery build.","The action picks up just where it left off in Who Could That Be at This Hour? Twelve-year-old Lemony Snicket is still in the strange, dilapidated town of Stain'd-by-the-Sea, staying at the Lost Arms with his ditzy chaperone, S. Theodora Markson. They're hired to solve a new case: find the missing Cleo Knight, a young chemist who's working on a secret project -- but for whom? Things get confusing fast as she's sighted in different places at the same time. Theodora's quick to call the case closed, but Snicket is always several steps ahead of her as well as the town's bumbling police officers. He's constantly gathering clues and connecting the dots, which all lead back to the same evil man behind the trouble in the first book: Hangfire.
","This sequel is just as clever, entertaining, and full of mystery and wordplay as the series starter, Who Could That Be at This Hour? But here Snicket and readers get to know the kooky Stain'd-by-the-Sea residents better, learn about some of their relationships (including two young sweethearts), and learn more about the town's history and old feuds. There's also more playful interplay between Snicket and the kids and adults he encounters. With wry wit, he constantly foils the bickering husband-and-wife police officers, outsmarts his chaperone, figures out the deeper mystery behind the many bizarre developments, and makes friends along the way.
Amid the laughs, twists, and turns, the tension and danger mount, leading to a dramatic conclusion that simultaneously satisfies and sets the stage for the continued pursuit of a major bad guy. Also, there's still much to learn about the trouble Snicket's sister is in back in the city -- a mystery that weighs on him throughout the book and about which readers get only a few hints. Stylized illustrations by Seth once again add intrigue.","Parents need to know that When Did You See Her Last? is the second book in the four-part All the Wrong Questions noir mystery series by Lemony Snicket, uthor of the 13-volume A Series of Unfortunate Events -- and alter ego of author Daniel Handler. This sequel is just as clever and suspenseful as Book 1, Who Could That Be at This Hour?, nd the 12-year-old Snicket is even funnier and more playful in his dealings with the kids and adults in the strange town of Stain'd-by-the Sea. There's more menace than actual violence, but a girl is imprisoned and chained up (readers only see the bruises from her shackles once she's free); a girl is stabbed in the arm with a knife (readers see her only after the injury is inflicted); a car crashes into a building; and it's mentioned that a man suffered terrible burns from an explosion years before. A girl's parents are drugged with laudanum to incapacitate them, and one adult celebrates with champagne and another has a glass of wine, although neither is shown drinking.

Return to the Willows,Rollicking sequel delightfully true to classic original.,"Picking up where we last saw our heroes Rat, Mole, Badger, and the irrepressible, well-meaning, disaster-prone Mr.Toad, author Jacqueline Kelly (who won a Newbery Honor for The Evolution of Calpurnia Tate) soon has them all embarked on new escapades in RETURN TO THE WILLOWS. Toad makes a brief foray into hot-air ballooning before being transformed into a genius by a laboratory accident; Rat develops a love interest; and an unlikely but fast friendship develops between Toad's brainy nephew, Humphrey, and Sammy, an impoverished young weasel. Disaster lurks around every corner, waiting for Rat, Mole, and Badger to save the day.
","This retains much of the original book’s fondness for lush descriptions, ornate adjectives, and philosophical sidetracks, which may be a turnoff for some kids who prefer a faster-moving story. But it also makes the book excellent read-aloud material. New Zealand-born author Texas resident Jacqueline Kelly keeps the Edwardian turn of phrase and supplements the more obscure Britishisms and foreign terms with explanatory, often hilarious footnotes for the benefit of the modern reader. The Wind in the Willows isn't every kid's dish, or every adult's for that matter, but those who love it will be glad to plunge into Kelly's ""respectful sequel.""","Parents need to know that Newbery Honor-winning author Jacqueline Kelly's ""respectful sequel"" to Kenneth Grahame's century-old classic is true to both the language and the spirit of the original, and Clint Young's lively, full-color illustrations make the book visually gorgeous as well. The original's leisurely pace and flowery language return here, often with comical explanatory footnotes, so those who found The Wind in the Willows slow going may have similar issues here. But the adventures are fun, the characters irresistible, the lessons plentiful--and the opportunities for kids who love big words are practically endless. And the same ornate language that may be an obstacle for younger readers is great for reading aloud.

But when her journalist mother is taken away for allegedly writing seditious works, Phaet must join the Militia to protect her siblings and have any hope of freeing her mother. Despite grueling odds, she pushes herself to succeed. But all Phaet's efforts could be for naught if she can't conquer her fears while remaining empathetic and humane.
","DOVE ARISING author Karen Bao keeps the plot moving smoothly, delivering action-packed scenes while steadily upping the stakes. The story moves its ""teen rebel"" tale to the moon, following reluctant enlistee Phaet Theta as she tries to save her family from disgrace and starvation by succeeding against the odds in the Militia.
The lunar setting is credibly depicted, and Bao populates the cast with multidimensional characters. The concluding chapters offer plenty of surprises, and the cliffhanger ending will leave readers primed for the next installment.","Parents need to know that Dove Arising features intense scenes of military training on the moon.

Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them,Rowling's humorous Magical Beasts 101 for charity.,"A facsimile edition of Harry's textbook for his Care of Magical Creatures class (complete with his, Ron's, and Hermione's margin notes), FANTASTIC BEASTS & WHERE TO FIND THEM consists of an alphabetical listing of magical beasts with a paragraph or two of description for each. The listings also give the Ministry of Magic (M.O.M.) classification for the level of danger posed by each creature.
The book also contains a forward by Albus Dumbledore, and chapters on the definition of beasts, history of Muggle awareness, and other basic information.
","Rowling's imagination seems to know no bounds -- this little volume contains descriptions of 85 creatures, some based on mythology and some entirely the author's creation. Though the descriptions are lively, reading Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them cover to cover can be a little dry for all but the most fanatic Potter fan. Most kids skim through to read all the clever margin notes that Harry and friends have written (the most fun part of the book).

The Lost Crown,Moving fictional diaries of Russia's last four tsarinas.,"Sarah Miller's historical novel follows the last few years of Russia's final Imperial family, the Romanovs, from the perspective of Tsar Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra's four daughters. Each chapter shifts the point of view between the four grand duchesses: smart Olga, doting Tatiana, sweet Maria, and mischievous Anastasia. Starting from the preamble to World War I in 1914 and continuing until the family's execution in 1918, the diary-style entries detail how the sisters handled everything from tending to wounded soldiers to their father's abdication and the subsequent years of house arrest, frightening transfers, and their final days before being executed along with their parents and four loyal staffers.
","After years of extensive research, Miller provides an amazingly detailed fictionalization of how the four grand duchesses spent their final years. Although it's not the most gripping novel at the start, the ""action"" picks up after the family's faith healer, Grigori Rasputin, is killed and their father abdicates. For many teens, it will be difficult to relate to these young women, who've been brought up in the isolated manner of all royal children, but parts of their story are universal: they long to be free of their constraints; they dote on but are jealous of their spoiled but chronically ill baby brother, Alexei; they love their parents unconditionally; they are closer even than the March girls of Little Women but still fight; they wonder if they'll ever fall in love, marry, have children. In the end, it's the girls' struggle to hold on to the beautifully ordinary aspects of daily family life that will move readers.","Parents need to know that this book is a fictionalized diary of Tsar Nicholas II's four daughters in the final years of their lives. The novel is based on the author's exhaustive research, but some teens may need help sorting out fact from fiction. The sisters mention but don't really witness any violence, as for the most part they were decently treated even in captivity. There's still some gritty material: As wartime Red Cross nurses, they discuss injured soldiers, amputations, and death -- and the family's ultimate execution is graphically described. Anyone who reads this book will learn a great deal about the Romanov family, although not so much about the revolution that led to their family's demise.

"Crooked Kingdom: Six of Crows, Book 2","Another impossible mission, another mature, riveting read.","In CROOKED KINGDOM, Kaz and his crew are still reeling after being double-crossed by the very crooked merchant Jan Van Eck. Not only did they not get their money for breaking into the Ice Court and retrieving Kuwei, a Shu who can make the dreaded drug jurda parem, but also Inej has been kidnapped and held as leverage. Of course with control over the manufacture of a powerful drug that turns Grisha into unstoppable soldiers on the line, there are plenty more enemies to make -- whole countries and gang bosses alike. Kaz's team's difficult rescue of Inej is just the beginning. Then Jesper's innocent father is lured to town -- more leverage -- Grisha such as Jesper and Nina are hunted down in the streets, and their faces turn up on wanted posters all over Ketterdam.
","Like the amazing Inej on a high wire, this satisfying sequel is both incredibly exciting and well balanced. Crooked Kingdom may have  bit less action than the nonstop Six of Crows, but readers who feel invested in these fascinating and flawed characters won't mind fewer gladiator-style prison fights in favor of a better grasp of Wylan's fear of his evil father or Jesper's fear of his good one and his gambling addiction. Between plotting and scheming to stay ahead of absolutely everyone -- gang bosses, merchants, police, whole foreign kingdoms -- readers are treated to a real understanding of these characters, of the nature and power of addiction and PTSD, and even of the damaging effects of slavery, prostitution, and prejudice.
And then we get back to the action. Yes, Kaz stays one step ahead even though it always looks as if he's not. But were it not for Nina's frightening new gift, Inej's ability to dodge knives at unspeakable heights, Jesper's unerring shooting accuracy, and the astounding talents of the rest of the crew, all of Kaz's uber-complex plans would go nowhere. It's a nail-biting joy to watch it all unfold and to see this ultimate team of underdogs best an entire city of enemies.","Parents need to know that Leigh Bardugo's Crooked Kingdom, the follow-up to the riveting Six of Crows, is related to her Grisha trilogy, but you can read Six of Crows and this sequel without reading the other series first. As with Six of Crows, the content is consistently mature and a better fit for mature teen readers -- high schoolers, not middle schoolers. Characters are complex, flawed, and sometimes responsible for some of the worst violence. While there's no arena fighting in this one, there are a few jarringly gory moments, the worst being a gunshot in an eye socket: ""[T]he blast didn't just take her eye but most of the top of her skull."" An important character is shot and killed, a torture scene includes a mallet that almost shatters a leg, and main characters take some truly bloody beatings (killing some in the process, including a man with broken nails in his windpipe). They are also shot at repeatedly and pelted with knives and throwing stars (one time on a high wire with no net). Explosions injure people, and corpses turn zombie-like or are taken out of morgues. Other mature content includes kissing and flirting, both straight and gay, and some drinking and drug nd gambling addiction among teens.

The Legend of Holly Claus,St. Nick's saintly child plays fantasy heroine.,"In 1878, a 10-year-old boy sends a letter to Santa Claus inquiring what Santa himself wishes as a gift. This act of generosity is the catalyst for Santa and wife to receive a baby. Holly is born of the purest heart and becomes the means for escape by an imprisoned-by-curse warlock named Herrikhan. He manages to set her infant heart in ice and threatens to return one day to collect it, and thus set himself free. \ \
The Land of the Immortals is closed then to the outer world, and Holly is forced to live in a castle constantly glistening with snowflakes to avoid melting her heart; and in isolation except for loving family and set of animal friends. Obsessed with the life in New York City as seen through her telescope, she discovers a way to escape. In Victorian New York, she brings happiness to all she meets by helping people, young and old, acknowledge their dreams. Herrikhan follows masquerading as a wealthy young man and potential suitor. Holly, however, has her eye on another lonely soul.
","This is a good read for kids who like fantasy, strong female characters, and a bit of innocent romance. A new take on the jolly, pink-cheeked, white-bearded man living in the North Pole, the father of Holly Claus has a temper, can be impetuous, is flirtatious with his wife, and struggles like any parent to settle his overachieving adolescent daughter.
This book in the Julie Andrews Collection is filled with flowery descriptions and accompanied by delicate illustrations. Certainly easy to read, the bulk of the drama is in the beginning and end, which may cause some readers to put it down and forget to pick it back up. However, this is a great holiday selection for kids who favor books with fantasy, romantic heroism, and plucky females.","Parents need to know that an evil warlock kills a beloved character and threatens to kill not only the main character but all loved ones associated. There's also young love, harmlessly illustrated through fluttering eyelashes and breathy dialogue. Holly and friends meet a Jewish family who share Hanukkah as another holiday observed during this time.

Big Bob and the Thanksgiving Potatoes,Funny story regardless of the season.,"Second-graders Big Bob and Big Gloria are best friends. When their teacher asks the class to make turkey decorations for Thanksgiving, Big Bob and Big Gloria tell him they are vegetarians. His response? \""Make Thanksgiving potatoes.\"" Although written around a Thanksgiving theme, kids often want to read this funny, intelligent story, regardless of the season.
 ","In this funny, thought-provoking story, Bob mentions many disadvantages of being big that young readers may not have thought of, including the mean things other kids say. Author Daniel Pinkwater writes with humor and feeling, conveying Bob's difficulties in a way that will bring out children's empathy. Because Bob tells the story in first person, some readers may identify with him and learn to understand how he feels.
As a read-aloud, repetition and an odd avoidance of contractions sometimes make the language awkward, but most children reading to themselves will hardly notice. Jill Pinkwater's pictures are deceptively simple and have the look of something a talented child might draw. BIG BOB AND THE THANKSGIVING POTATOES encourages fluent and independent reading, and the book's excellent suggestions for helping your child before, during, and after reading the story will help you make the most of the experience.","Parents need to know that amusingly childish pictures and simple, if somewhat stilted language convey an entertaining story.

Maggie's Monkeys,Sweet tale of love and imagination for preschoolers.,"When Maggie discovers that pink monkeys are living in her family's refrigerator, her mom and dad go along with her imaginary world, but her brother has a harder time with it. Finally, when some of his friends come over, he comes over to her side and sees why his parents have done so all along.
","Pink monkeys living in the refrigerator...what could be more ridiculous! Still, with its rather dreamy, softly-edged illustrations, this sweet and tender story will strike a chord with anyone who has had to deal with someone else's imaginary world, or has had one of their own.
Parents and kids will enjoy the silly things the family does to help manage the pink monkeys. They'll agree with the older brother who knows what is real and doesn't quite get why everyone else is going along with the fantasy, and they'll cheer when the brother stands up to his friends. All in all, this is a fun book, even though believing that a family of pink polar monkeys might actually move into the refrigerator is quite a stretch.","Parents need to know that this book deals with a little girl's imaginary world, and the family's methods for dealing with it.

Beezus and Ramona,The first Ramona book is a treat for all ages.,"Big sister Beezus struggles to manage life with her little sister, Ramona.
","Though more than 50 years old, BEEZUS AND RAMONA has lost none of its charm. The frustrations of being an older sibling to a rambunctious preschooler are the same no matter what the era. Kids will sympathize with gentle Beezus as she struggles with her little sister, Ramona. The text is sometimes a little dated -- the girls' father has handkerchiefs (they tie them to sticks for flags) and a new book costs only $2.50 -- but the story itself is timeless.
Each chapter stands on its own as a funny story but the book also holds together to make a fine long-range narrative. It's a satisfying read for kids who are frustrated by chapter-ending cliff-hangers or for families who are reading together across several days. It makes a great read-aloud book.

Dear Rachel Maddow,Teen can't stop confessing to her hero in poignant story.,"In DEAR RACHEL MADDOW, Brynn Harper's life is on a steady downward slide. Her father left the family, her brother died of an overdose, her mother married a cruel, abusive man, and her grades have tanked. Furthermore, Brynn's girlfriend broke up with her, and she's banned from working on the school newspaper -- her one passion at school -- until she raises her GPA. When her teacher assigns his students to write to a ""celebrity hero,"" Brynn chooses television news personality Rachel Maddow. After getting a response from Maddow, Brynn continues to write to her but saves the emails to her Drafts folder rather than sending them. The emails serve as a journal of sorts for Brynn. She writes about the turmoil in her life, both at home and at school, and about her grief over losing her brother to an overdose. An opportunity comes up at school for Brynn to run for a special student representative position. While these types of roles always go to the honors students, Brynn feels that the concerns of the average and special-needs students are rarely considered by the more elite kids and the administration. After watching The Rachel Maddow Show so often, Brynn has a good idea of what a representative democracy should be and how all voices should be heard. She takes what she has learned from her television hero and dives into the election at school, upsetting the entrenched power structure. Through it all, she has to figure out what she's going to do with her life and where to find the reserves to keep chugging along when life won't stop throwing her curve balls.
","A teen girl pours her heart out to her celebrity hero, Rachel Maddow, in this poignant and funny story. Dear Rachel Maddow starts out a little slow but picks up as Brynn Harper's personality starts to shine through her hundreds of unsent emails. Brynn's voice is witty and engaging. Her creative swearing is entertaining but will likely turn off readers who don't like profanity. The best part of the story is following along with Brynn and seeing what she faces on a day-to-day basis. She often wants to give up but finds a way to keep battling on. She's the kind of kid easily overlooked at school because she isn't a superstar, plus she has serious trouble at home because her dad left and her mom married a verbally and physically abusive man. She also faces some bullying at school but handles it quite well. In fact, she is a good gay role model for kids in that she owns her sexuality and it isn't an issue for her at all. When Brynn dives into the school election, you can't help but root for her. Her reluctant hero attitude is endearing.
The main downside to the plot is that Brynn has so much stacked against her at one point that the story starts to tip into bleak and overwhelming territory. Most of the secondary characters are one-dimensional, especially her opponent, Adam. But Brynn is such a fun, cool character, she more than makes up for that deficit.","Parents need to know that Dear Rachel Maddow is about a teen girl, Brynn, who writes to television personality Rachel Maddow for a school project. Brynn then ends up writing Maddow hundreds of emails she never sends, unloading her family problems, her deepest fears, and the social and political high school drama she's going through. Brynn's writing style is casual, funny, and profane, with lots of swearing, including variations on ""f--k"" and ""s--t"" and ""d--k,"" ""ass,"" ""douche bag,"" and ""bitch."" Drug use is mentioned in passing, as her brother died of an overdose. In one scene, a teen drinks to the point of getting alcohol poisoning. Both the drug use and drinking are presented as cautionary tales. The book offers good discussion points around kids who are invisible at school, parent/child relationships, and LGBTQ teens.

"When Sophie Gets Angry--Really, Really Angry",Kids will respond to Sophie's frustration.,"Incensed over having her toy snatched, Sophie spirals into a fit of monumental proportions. First she acts out, stomping and hollering. Then, still simmering, she's out the door, running off her excess energy.
Finally, a bout of tears erases the last vestiges of Sophie's anger. Now she is ready to climb her favorite tree and let nature console her. A soothed and collected Sophie returns to the welcoming embrace of her family.
","This accessible story helps kids understand that anger is a natural response, that it happens to almost everyone, and that there are ways to manage it. Most important, the author reassures children that their families will still love them when it's over. Full-color pages are alight with blazing reds, oranges, and purples at the height of Sophie's rage, only to be replaced with tranquil blues and serene greens as her equilibrium is restored.
Most kids will recognize their own behavior in Sophie's outburst. Molly Bang encourages readers to be responsible for their anger and angry actions, showing how Sophie works to resolve her anger on her own -- without time-outs or punishment. Sophie's choice of anger management -- running -- may be problematic for some parents. While older children can understand that Sophie is removing herself from the situation in order to calm down, younger children may require additional adult commentary.","Parents need to know that Sophie deals with her anger by removing herself from the situation and running.

Wolves,"Witty with incredible art, but too scary for some.","A floppy-eared rabbit checks out a book about wolves from the library, and learns facts that alarm him. An alternative ending stresses that this is a work of fiction, and the vegetarian wolf becomes the rabbit's best friend.
","Readers will find themselves as engrossed as the rabbit by the growing suspense in this book. Page by page, the innocent child-like creature is walking closer to danger. And the exquisite drawings definitely add to the drama. Always in black and white pencil, the wolf is drawn as a salivating, sharp-toothed, chop-licking predator, who is just waiting for the right moment, and gets his chance. The rabbit is a long-eared, friendly, beige-colored cutie who doesn't have a clue about what he's walking into.
The author's assurance that no rabbit was harmed in the making of this book, and her alternative ending in which both become friends, may be a comfort to some readers who find themselves horrified at the ending. Others may appreciate the witty, dry humor of the first version, and want to stick with it. Either way, this is a unique book, full of small clever details, fascinating art, and a story that most kids, especially the less sensitive ones, will enjoy.","Parents need to know that the illustrations in this book are fascinating, as are the facts. However, both may scare more sensitive younger kids. Also, the main character, a book-reading rabbit, is humanized, then threatened by the carnivorous wolf.

","This novel is a perfect mixture of a coming-of-age story, identity development, family dynamics, nd social commentary.

She's lso unafraid to tackle police brutality in the age of social media -- what that means for victims, and what it means for kids just trying to figure out who they are and how they fit in the world.

It's a snapshot of Ann's roller-coaster relationship with her family, food, weight, and body image. She seems stuck in a cycle of self-loathing and self-medicating with food. But when her Aunt Jackie announces in June that she and her longtime partner, Chris, will be married in August, and she wants Ann to be a bridesmaid, Ann promises herself that she'll lose 45 pounds and fit into a great dress by the time of the wedding. This marks the beginning of a journey in which Ann gets her first job, loses a friend, gains a friend, gets a crush, starts an infomercial diet plan, learns to dance, and deeply explores issues concerning her parents' divorce and the ways her relationships to food and family are intertwined.
","45 Pounds (More or Less) is not an easy read. Ann suffers numerous indignities (both real and imagined); she's in a lot of pain, and it's hard to witness her sadness and humiliation.

The Odyssey,"Essential, epic poem of Greek gods, monsters, and heroes.","When THE ODYSSEY begins, the heroic warrior, Odysseus, has been missing for 10 years, and dozens of greedy suitors are camped out in his house in Ithaca, courting his wife, Penelope, eating his meat and drinking his wine. Odysseus' son, Telemakhos wants to take his place as head of the household, but he is too young and inexperienced to rule over the suitors and he doesn't know if his father is coming home. With the help of the goddess Athena (who disguises herself as a family friend), Telemakhos embarks on a journey of discovery where he meets people who have known his father, and learns a great deal about Odysseus and about himself. Meanwhile, Odysseus is still trying to sail home from the wars; he must overcome numerous supernatural obstacles before he can reclaim his home and family.
","The Odyssey isn't just an important book, it's also a very exciting book and a beautiful work of literature. As the popular Percy Jackson series for younger readers attests, kids are fascinated by Greek tales of gods, monsters, and heroes, and The Odyssey is the original Olympian tale. The epic hero, Odysseus, overcomes supernatural creatures and all kinds of magic, thanks to gods warring among themselves. The prose of The Odyssey, while possibly daunting for middle school and younger kids, is worth appreciating with its beautiful, rhythmically repeated images: ""grey-eyed Athena,"" dawn spreading her ""fingertips of rose,"" etc.","Parents need to know that, as the name implies, The Odyssey is an epic poem of journey and discovery.

""We hang out all the time, even when you can't see her."" Earth relays its basic history: It was born 4.54 billion years ago, but plants, bugs, animals, and humans came much later -- the humans only 200,000 years ago. Back matter describes (in brief) continents, Earth's place in the Milky Way, and how the Earth supports life in the ocean and on land, with notes about the period of the dinosaurs, mentions of volcanic activity and climate change, nd a list of sources.
","This fresh, lively picture book covers basic Earth history in a fun, engaging way that will delight kids and teach them lots of scientific facts. Thanks to its friendly narrator -- the Earth itself -- and David Litchfield's bright cartoon-style illustrations, Earth! My First 4.54 Billion Years draws kids in and teaches them about our planet's place in the solar system, the development of continents, plant and animal life, nd human inhabitants. Concepts are stated in ways kids can easily understand, such as: ""My favorite things to do are spinning -- it takes me a whole day to go around once -- and circling the sun. That takes me an entire year."" The book works both as nonfiction and as a cute story with a cheerful main character.","Parents need to know that Earth! My First 4.54 Billion Years, by Stacy McAnulty nd illustrated by David Litchfield, is a fun, science-fact-filled picture book that gives a basic history of Earth and describes its location in the solar system among its seven ""sibling"" planets.

The Civil War,Brings Civil War to life; some gruesome photos.,"More than 100 photographs and illustrations from the Library of Congress bring to life to the story of the War Between the States. Civil War is a well-researched record of the camp life, the battles, and the heroic deeds of men in the Union and Confederate armies.
 ","Martin Sandler's narrative and the Library of Congress' collection of records make CIVIL WAR an outstanding book. Photographers and artists recorded the true face of the war, and from their pictures children learn about the boredom of daily camp life and the horror of battle. Graphic scenes show a kind of warfare much different from that depicted in films and on television news today.
Children will be fascinated by a startling fact: Hundreds of thousands of Civil War soldiers and sailors were under 15 years of age. Many served as drummer boys, but sometimes they dropped their instruments to fire the guns of fallen soldiers. Children will browse this or use it as a resource, and it can be read aloud to kids who lack the reading skill or maturity to read it on their own. Even for older children, the book will bring up hard questions that require an adult's assistance.","Parents need to know that black-and-white photographs and color drawings bring to life the tragic events of the Civil War. There are some gruesome photos.

The Negro Speaks of Rivers,Words and watercolors sing in a voice as deep as the river.,"This short poem by Langston Hughes was considered to be the ""song of the Harlem Renaissance."" Using the river as its primary symbol, it captures the history of African-American people from ancient times to today, and celebrates their courage and strength. Illustrator E.B. Lewis has created watercolors that bring the lines of the poem to life and make them accessible, and even more meaningful, to readers of all ages.
","This is a beautiful illustration of Hughes' classic poem, and one that will help all readers, but especially kids, understand the words that Langston Hughes wrote. The poem is moving, both real and spiritual, and the watercolors are breathtaking. The illustrator's note on the final page explains his own connection to the poem and the paintings, and adds a further element of meaning to the book. And, to show the depth of his connection, he has depicted himself as the person who is praying while being embraced by the river.
Sensitive, moving watercolors bring amazing depth and meaning to the lines of the poem that are printed against the various river scenes. Spanning the stretch of time from before the pyramids to the modern day, some paintings are dark, others filled with light, but all with the delicate kind of strength that Langston Hughes expressed in his words.

"Chosen: Slayer, Book 2",Demon-slaying sequel has more wit and angst.,"In CHOSEN: SLAYER, BOOK 2, Nina, chosen slayer of demons, is setting up a sanctuary for them. She's determined to only slay the bad ones from now on. But lines get blurred when she finds out her twin sister, Artemis, is in cahoots with a drug dealer who preys on the very demons she's trying to protect. And when she discovers that a major funder of their operations, someone her own mother tells her not to mess with, is preying upon innocents as well. They all have ties to someone called the Sleeper, whose rabid followers will do anything to help him regain his power, even if it means the end of the world as we know it.
","The mysteries are too easy for readers to solve, but Buffy fans will still enjoy this witty, angsty sequel as wooden stakes fly and the other kind of stakes get even higher. Chosen follows the same pattern as the first book, Slayer, so you'll know who the secret bad guys are and you'll know what they're after. You may be miffed that the characters are so blind to it.
That aside, Chosen works well when it combines action with wit. There are plenty of moments where ultra-strong Nina takes out a bunch of villains while delivering the perfect one-liners. They remind readers what a strange job she has in this world of demons that can siphon off your feelings or skip through dimensions or hold conferences at the Marriott. Though, sometimes the wit turns to cynicism, which leads to some serious angst. While these passages of intense reflection could have been edited down, Nina's doubts and indecision are relatable, even if her butt-kicking job isn't, and Chosen soon gets back to the butt-kicking action.","Parents need to know that Chosen is the second book in the Slayer series from the world of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series and movie. It's written by longtime Buffy fan/bestselling author Kiersten White (And I Darken trilogy).  It helps to have watched the TV series to keep up with some of the characters and lore that pop up throughout the story. Like the TV series, there's lots of demon fighting, mostly with stakes, knives, Tasers, and superpowered martial arts. Eyeballs are plucked out of vampires and also one bad-guy human, who then gets his neck snapped. There are plenty of injuries, including a slit throat nd broken bones, and there's much talk about the deaths of loved ones and loss. Other mature content includes a few kisses, straight and LGBTQ, and some swearing, including ""s--t"" and ""fecking hell,"" spelled like that. The main character, Nina, and friends get drunk on whiskey and absinthe and decide it's best to ask for a ride home. For most of Chosen, though, Nina is less decisive. Her guilt over past mistakes keeps her from trusting herself until she focuses every action on protecting those she loves.

The Widow's Broom,Shivery story with a surprise ending.,"A witch leaves behind a broom that can't fly anymore, but it can still do chores for the lonely widow who befriends it. But the neighbors think it's evil and want to destroy it. Spectacular sepia-toned illustrations highlight this shivery story with a surprise ending.
 ","The big attraction in Chris Van Allsburg's books is his stunning illustrations, but this is one of his better stories as well. Reminiscent of an entry in the old ""Amazing Stories"" TV series, this pleasantly atmospheric tale has a twist at the end that delights kids with the satisfaction of seeing overbearing bullies get their due through the cleverness of the meek.
The full-page pictures are done in textured shades of gray that give the impression of sepia-tone art. The style is reminiscent of the one he used in The Mysteries of Harris Burdick, but grainier. Some of them are cinematically dramatic, such as the picture of the witch looking to the skies, lit by flames, while others, such as a scene of surprised chickens being fed by the broom, are funny.","Parents need to know that this atmospheric story, accompanied by Van Allsburg's usual magnificent artwork, has an ending twist that delights kids.

Monkey and Me,"Monkey see, monkey do game for kids who love make-believe.","Written as a rhyming game, the little girl and her gangly stuffed monkey invite kids to make believe along with them. First they waddle like penguins and, then, with the monkey stuffed inside her shirt, they bound across the page like kangaroos. Likewise, they mimic bats, elephants, and finally...monkeys! In the end, they are both worn out with play and snoozing peacefully while one of the make-believe monkeys gazes playfully over the table top.
","With her usual muted red, brown, and gray tones and her cute, expressive characters, Emily Gravett has created another playful, quirky book for young readers to enjoy. Kids and their parents will find this one fun, and all too short. As the little actors get caught up in the ""monkey see, monkey do"" game, they will want the make believe to go on and on. And, more than likely, as the little girl dozes off at the table, they will take off on dramatic adventures of their own. Besides being a joy to read, this would be a perfect book for a beginning drama class.","Parents need to know that once they open this book they will find themselves playing along with their kids, and the little girl and her monkey, as they jump, cavort, and imitate different animals.

Small Damages,Luminous story of pregnant teen's summer in Spain.,"It's the summer of 1996, which 18-year-old Kenzie had planned to spend with her four BFFs at the Jersey Shore after their high-school graduation. But instead, her friends -- including boyfriend Kevin -- are at the shore while Kenzie's what-will-people-think mom has sent her off to Spain to live with friends of friends until the baby she's carrying, fathered by Kevin, is born and adopted by a Spanish couple. SMALL DAMAGES, Kenzie's story of that summer as told to her daughter, finds her learning new things and discovering new possibilities among the people and places she gets to know during her trip.
","This could well have been a minefield of clichés nd preachiness, like so many other books involving teen pregnancy, but Beth Kephart creates characters and events that feel right and ring true. Just as in real life, people are complicated, not just personifications of good or bad; even as Kevin abandons her and their child, Kenzie remembers all the great things he did that used to make her happy. Kephart's colorful descriptions of Seville and the Spanish countryside, as seen through Kenzie's eyes, reveal her unabashed love for the place.","Parents need to know that Small Damages is narrated by pregnant, 18-year-old Kenzie, who's packed off to Spain while her friends, including the baby's father, are enjoying a long-planned summer at the Jersey Shore. Besides the issue of unplanned teen pregnancy, the narrative, which is directed at Kenzie's unborn daughter, explores other adult themes -- the Spanish Civil War and its atrocities, bullfighting, the death of parents, parent-child conflict, love gone wrong -- and has occasional crude language (""butt,"" ""big-ass""). The complex characters, their intertwining stories, and author Beth Kephart's luminous writing keep this book intriguing and emotionally satisfying.

"Three Dark Crowns, Book 1",Thrilling but very dark tale of murderous triplet queens.,"In THREE DARK CROWNS, three queens -- triplets Katharine, Arsinoe, and Mirabella -- are busy preparing for their 16th birthday. There'll be the usual three parties, because they were separated when they were six years old. Katharine, who lives with those gifted in their immunity to poisons, will feast on a poison banquet to show her strength -- a strength she has yet to acquire. Arsinoe, who lives in a community of naturalists, will show off her familiar, an animal she desperately hopes arrives to claim her in time to show her strength. And Mirabella will dazzle her town of elementals by summoning the weather to do her bidding. Mirabella is the strongest nd most likely to impress a crowd. The priestesses in the temple want to declare her the next true queen. But to claim the throne, tradition dictates Mirabella must kill both her sisters within the year -- before they kill her.
","With triplet queens out to kill each other, this may not be a book to share with sisters, but if you're into dark, complex, nail-biting fantasy, you'll definitely share it with your friends. Three Dark Crowns will take an effort for some readers to piece together, as each queen's story is told separately. We meet Katharine first in a house full of Poisoners who regularly indulge in tainted banquets. Sickly from the lack of the immunity her gift should provide but still desperate to please, she gives off the creepiest vibe. Arsinoe takes longer to reach the same dark place; the desperate queen is slowly coerced into some shady magic practices to compensate for her weak gift. As for Mirabella, it's the bloodthirsty, cunning priestesses who add a delicious level of dark.
Each of the rites and rituals the queens endure -- the birthday parties, the festival of Beltane, the selection of the suitors, the Quickening -- are expertly woven into the story. Readers get the slow reveal of just what these doomed queens are up against. Will you root for the survival of one queen the way the towns do? For the small chance in this macabre world that mercy will rule out in the end? Even a reader's allegiance may shift with the cliffhanger at the end.","Parents need to know that Three Dark Crowns is the first in a fantasy series by the author of the acclaimed horror novel Anna Dressed in Blood. With the plot centering on 16-year-old triplet queens destined to murder each other in an attempt to rule, this dark gem is best for high school readers and up. The fractured way the story builds at the beginning also will make it harder for less practiced fantasy readers to follow. One queen is supposed to have the gift of poisoning and is sick often as she's trained to withstand poisonings. A boy prisoner is poisoned, and there's plenty of talk of other victims: past queens, assassinations, and even animals. A description of one bear-mauling death includes ""loops of entrails."" A hand is cut off as punishment; nother hand is stabbed through the middle and stuck in a tree as part of a ritual; nd there's a push off a cliff, talk of beheadings and arms chopped off, a near drowning, and a willing human sacrifice (we're spared much description). Teens drink wine and spirits, are sometimes poisoned on purpose, and have sex (with little described besides kissing). A teen boy is charged with teaching one of the queens to kiss and be alluring to future suitors. These queens are caught up in a play for power with very little control over their magical gifts or their destinies. They find different ways to manage the pressure, some healthy, some destructive. One queen even has the dangerous audacity to want to show mercy to her sisters.

The Tragedy Paper,Thoughtful story about a tragedy teen boy brings on himself.,"As an albino, Tim Macbeth is used to rude stares, but he still cringes inside. He transfers to Irving School his senior year and grows obsessed with Vanessa, a popular girl who seems to like him ... but only when no one is watching. Tim's crush and his self-doubt set him on a path toward disaster. Exactly what happened, and why, is revealed in a series of CDs he recorded and left in his old dorm room for its next resident, Duncan, who returns to Irving still tortured by last year's events. Duncan is trying to move on: He's pursuing the girl of his dreams and tackling his senior project -- writing the legendary Tragedy Paper. He'd like to ignore Tim's story, but can't resist the lure of learning the truth about Tim and Vanessa.
","The twin narrative -- alternating between Duncan's experiences and Tim's flashback -- lends drama to the thoughtfully spun out story. Tim and Vanessa get off to a promising start, and their first encounter nicely captures the awkwardness and earnestness of teens on the brink of adulthood.
THE TRAGEDY PAPER is a decent debut novel, but author Elizabeth LaBan stirs up a lot of material that doesn't seem to go anywhere. Is Patrick really such a bad guy? Is Vanessa befriending Tim or toying with him? Adult authority figures described as strict or aloof turn out to be rather blandly kind. LaBan layers on the ominous foreshadowing, and the reader braces for grim ending a la Ethan Frome. But the climactic event isn't much of a shock and the menace ultimately lacks teeth. The real tragedy is quieter and should resonate with teens: how Tim let his self-consciousness and desire to be accepted get in the way of his better judgment, and how he brought suffering upon himself.","Parents need to know that The Tragedy Paper has some of the hallmarks of boarding school tales: There's a little drinking, some kissing, a fair amount of social stratification, and a lot of breaking school rules. But it's a pretty gentle book overall, and the much-hyped tragedy revealed at the book's end is more thought-provoking than shocking.

Her new robot classmate needs help learning how to survive seventh grade, but Max keeps earning demerits every time she tries to assist him. Max wants to help her robotic buddy, but she doesn't want to be expelled in the process.
","There are plenty of stories about robots who wish they were human, but this cheerful, charming, and easy-to-read novel offers a fresh outlook and some original plotting. Fuzzy focuses on some of the absurdities of middle school, and the ""Big Brother"" surveillance setup ensures that the stakes are high for Max and her robotic friend, Fuzzy.

Bunny Cakes,Baby Max struggles to write -- kids will relate.,"Max has not yet learned to talk, read, or write, so how can he convey his yearning for Red-Hot Marshmallow Squirters? Cleverly, he takes his cue from older sister Ruby, who proficiently uses signs and symbols to communicate. Max experiences the frustration of learning a difficult skill, but finds out that persistence and ingenuity make it possible to achieve new goals.
","Max exhibits an important stage of learning to read and write as he invents his own symbol to get his message across in this entertaining story. When children scribble a message and expect adults to be able to read it, they are demonstrating their understanding that people communicate through written symbols. With support from adults and meaningful opportunities to engage in pretend writing, they gradually begin to recognize traditional symbols, such as the letters of the alphabet.
Ruby and Max's use of written symbols is integral to the story line and a focal point of the illustrations. Writing is further emphasized by close-up insets of the yellow-lined paper and the written messages of both characters. Rosemary Wells' cartoonlike style of drawing and her expressive bunny characters will keep children pleading, ""Read it again!""","Parents need to know that this story is written with minimal text and punctuated by cartoon illustrations.

Surviving the Applewhites,Lighthearted tale of eccentric family's creative homeschool.,"Twelve-year-old E.D Applewhite wasn't too happy when her father decided she and her siblings should be homeschooled at their own Creative Academy in rural North Carolina. She's even less happy when Jake, a troubled youth who's been kicked out of too many schools to count, shows up to join them. In alternating narratives, E.D. tells of her struggles to fit in with her own family while Jake tries to figure out how best to annoy the Applewhites. Despite their initial resistance, however, E.D. and Jake get drawn into the riotous family drama -- both emotional and literal -- as E.D.'s volatile father enlists everyone's help in his production of The Sound of Music.
","From the terminally optimistic poetess Aunt Lucille to E.D's brother Hal, Surviving the Applewhites is chock-full of delightful eccentric characters. The banner in the Applewhites' schoolroom reads, ""Education is an adventurous quest for the meaning of life, involving an ability to think things through."" The rest of the Applewhites embrace this motto wholeheartedly as they pursue their many creative interests, but E.D. and new student Jake have their own reasons to be skeptical. E.D. and Jake serve as two more grounded lenses through which to view the creative commotion of the family, but the real fun occurs as they each gradually lose their objectivity and get sucked into the whirlwind on their own terms.","Parents need to know that Surviving the Applewhites, a 2004 Newbery Honor winner, features a protagonist who has been sent to attend the Applewhites' Creative Academy due to his bad behavior. Jake has been kicked out of many schools; he smokes, has reputedly set fire to a school, swears constantly (but the words he says are not mentioned), has scarlet spiked hair and various piercings, and his parents are said to be in jail for growning marijuana. However, he doesn't show much of this behavior once he starts attending the Applewhites' school, and his attempts to smoke are thwarted. As E.D. tells him, ""Wit’s End is a smoke-free environment.""

She's struggling under the weight of it all while trying to keep her sister and herself out of the foster care system. When Damien and Junice meet, their love is unlikely and more powerful than either could have imagined.

"Wires and Nerve: The Lunar Chronicles Series, Vol. 1",Tough female droid fuels fun Lunar Chronicles graphic novel.,"In WIRES AND NERVE, not long after the end of the big Lunar war that brought Queen Selene (Cinder) to the throne, more trouble is afoot. The wolf-human hybrids that evil Queen Levana smuggled onto Earth have gone rogue, living secretly around the globe and killing humans in packs. Cinder feels responsible for getting them back to Luna and rehabilitating them but doesn't know how to do it. Enter her loyal droid Iko. With some martial arts butt-kicking and a tranquilizer gun, she corrals many of the hybrids. But with each covert raid, a few always get away. One escapee in particular, Alpha Steele, proves to be a much bigger threat than all the rest. He insists that Queen Selene can reverse the hybrids' mutations but doesn't want to. And his way to get revenge against her: target all of Selene's friends, starting with Thorne and Cress.
","Here's another fun way to enter the sci-fi fairy tale world of the Lunar Chronicles series: through the butt-kicking, fashion-forward adventures of Cinder's best droid-friend, Iko. Her loyalty to her friends and determination to prove everyone wrong about droids -- they don't have to be obedient, docile servants -- pushes Iko to brave new places. Really, rooting for Iko is akin to rooting for feminism. Not many graphic novels head in that direction.
For readers hoping for glimpses of their old friends from the series. don't worry -- they're all in Wires and Nerve, especially Cinder, Thorne, and Cress. Artist Doug Holgate has a lot of characters to juggle and manages to make them all unique and full of personality. In the style of most graphic novels, a big ""To Be Continued"" is slapped on the end, leaving much unresolved, including a reunion between Cinder and Kai after some buildup. It's a disappointment but also an assurance that Lunar Chronicles fans will be scrambling for Volume 2.","Parents need to know that Wires and Nerve is the first of two graphic novels planned in Marissa Meyer's best-selling Lunar Chronicles series. The story takes place after the final battle in the fourth book, Winter. Wires and Nerve includes a quick recap of the main series before the title page. So, in theory, those who haven't read anything in the series before could keep up, but it won't be easy. After references to the big, bloody battle at the end of Winter, the violent content here is much milder. Mostly Iko the droid fights wolf-human hybrids with martial arts, tranquilizer guns, and knives. One hybrid wields a sword. The droid, Iko, lives with a lot of discrimination. As a droid she's supposed to be obedient and docile. Despite that, she feels loyalty and is a fierce protector of her friends. She's even up for a little romance.

Not Afraid of Dogs,"Sweet, poignant story of overcoming fear.","""I'm the bravest boy of all!"" says Daniel. But he is afraid of dogs. ""I'm not afraid of dogs,"" says Daniel. ""I just don't like them."" So he avoids them as best he can, even climbing up a lamppost to avoid a dog-walker.
But when his mother agrees to take care of his aunt's dog while she travels, avoiding it becomes even harder. He locks himself in his room, and refuses to come out even for dinner. ""He's afraid,"" says his sister. ""Am not!"" yells Daniel from his room. But a midnight trip to the bathroom during a thunderstorm, only to find the terrified dog huddled behind the toilet, brings out a feeling in Daniel stronger than his fear: compassion.
","Susanna Pitzer shows the story in simple, clear text that lets readers draw their own conclusions. Before the text even starts, Larry Day draws readers in with his enchanting illustrations on the cover and endpapers, combining borderless pen-and-ink drawings with watercolor and gouache paintings. Pitzer's knack for family dialogue is matched by Day's vivid depiction of body language. Together, the two become more than the sum of their parts.
This happens most poignantly in the confrontation between boy and dog, when Daniel's compassion for the terrified dog wins out over his fear and, in a beautiful spread, he drops to his knees to gather the dog into his arms, both of their hearts pounding.

Dead End in Norvelt,Charming story of a small-town boy's unlikely adventures.,"In the small-and-growing-smaller town of Norvelt, PA, in 1962, Jack is looking forward to a summer playing baseball with his friends. Instead, he ends up grounded, his only opportunities to leave the house occurring when his elderly neighbor requires his assistance writing obituaries for the newspaper. To his surprise, he begins to look forward to his sessions as her scribe, and strange and wonderful adventures ensue, including 11-year-old Jack driving an ancient car, a home operation on the kitchen table to stop his nosebleeds, frequent visits to the undertaker's, and, ultimately, a murder mystery.
","There’s a touch of the tall tale in DEAD END IN NORVELT, reinforced by the fact that the main character shares the author's name. (Though this is by no means an autobiography -- the author lived in the real Norvelt only until age 7.) The book's Jack is charming and earnest and serves as a willing foil for Norvelt’s wacky residents. There’s the undertaker's daughter, a small, fearless girl named Bunny, who knows a million dead-person jokes; the tricycle-riding, self-righteous Mr. Spizz, who hands out citations for overgrown weeds; Jack's father, who enlists Jack’s help in building a bomb shelter; and especially Mrs. Volker, the eldest-living Norvelt resident, town coroner, passionate writer of obituaries, and crusader for human rights. Though the characters are wonderfully colorful, the episodic structure sometimes bogs the story down. Still, the humor will carry most readers toward the end when the pace picks up and moves toward an exciting conclusion. ","Parents need to know that this book is filled with comic violence and unlikely scenarios, but it also includes an overriding theme of the importance of social justice. Current or former Girl Scouts may be bothered by the fact that a friend of Jack’s sells Girl Scout cookies in order to earn money for herself.

The Magician: The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel,Magical twins take on Paris in exciting sequel.,"Suddenly finding themselves in Paris thanks to a magical gateway, California twins Sophie and Josh, the immortal alchemist Nicholas Flamel, and the vampire warrior Scathach must face a new enemy: Machiavelli. He's to collect the magical twins on behalf of the powerful magician Dee. Looking for any ally they can find in Flamel's home city, they run across Saint-Germaine, a former student of Flamel's who's versed in fire magic and currently tops on the techno music charts. But Germaine's house is known to Machiavelli, and it isn't long before scary creatures are unleashed to bring them in.
","THE MAGICIAN is just as fun and exciting as the first book. Maybe even more so, because now Sophie's powers have been awakened and she gets to try them out -- and she's really got some neat tricks up her sleeve, especially after she trains in Saint-Germaine's fire magic. Twin Josh is brooding over not having his powers awakened yet -- and makes some ""what were you thinking?!"" decisions because of it -- but he still gets a heroic warrior moment with a particularly nasty monster.
The book takes readers all over Paris -- even below it into the creepy catacombs -- where all sorts of historical and mythological figures pop up. The author, an authority on mythology and folklore, really unleashes some fascinating creatures on readers and barely restrains himself from delving into each character's complex history -- which is why the book, which takes place over just a couple of days, is close to 500 pages. No matter. This world is fun and exciting enough to let a little extra learning slip in.","Parents need to know that this second book in the series has about the same amount of sword fighting and monster battles as the first -- all of it is suspenseful but not gory. The teen twins with magical powers who are at the center of the story are in almost constant danger. There are some scary scenes in underground caves with giant spiders and creatures that feed off fear and panic. One main character vanishes and is feared dead. Two others can control fire.

Her newfound power is capable of great harm, and when she accidentally causes unimaginable tragedy, Wil determines to find the world's most powerful ""marveler"" in hopes that he can remove her cursed power. But to find Pahn, she'll have to rely on Loom, prince of a rival kingdom threatening war. Can she trust Loom? And what about his mysterious companion, Zay? And even if she finds Pahn, what price will he ask in return for his help?
","Veteran author Lauren DeStefano offers an absorbing story that fans of magical fantasy and action are sure to enjoy. The Glass Spare creates an intriguing blend of classic fantasy elements like magical powers and stone castles with modern touches like digital eyeglasses, cars, and electric lights. The world is well imagined and easy to believe. The writing is solid but doesn't have enough spark to lift it above a well-done genre piece.
Wil is easy for teens to relate to as she struggles with strange new capabilities while also trying to learn about trust, love, and loyalty. There's no satisfying ending here. Since the book is part of a planned two-volume story, the ending instead sets up the next half. Fantasy fans will have to wait to learn what happens.","Parents need to know that The Glass Spare is a magical fantasy by author Lauren DeStefano of the popular The Chemical Garden trilogy. There's some violence, including hand-to-hand fighting and magical attacks that mention blood but don't describe it in detail. Gore is rare and includes the sound of bones crunching and some detailed descriptions of pain and injuries. It's the first of two planned volumes that explore themes of loyalty, friendship, trust, and whether the end justifies the means. Wil is a strong female role model who's brave, loyal, and willing to do anything to protect loved ones, and she's pretty good in a fight, too. Rare sexy stuff includes noticing feelings of attraction and a few kisses. Fine for young teens and up who enjoy fantasies that combine magic and action.

There, she gradually learns about the Holocaust going on in the background; she also befriends a varied group of women, and they help one another survive.
","More about the friendship of the prisoners than the historical events themselves, Rose Under Fire still vividly portrays the mundane and brutal details of concentration camp life.

Invisible Girl,Searing memoir of growing up in troubled family offers hope.,"Actress-author and mental health advocate Mariel Hemingway recalls her childhood growing up in a famous family with a legacy of suicide, alcoholism, and mental illness. From infancy, Mariel recounts feeling like an INVISIBLE GIRL, desperate for her parents' attention and her two older sisters' affection. Her alcoholic parents are always partying and arguing, and family members escape by various means -- oldest sister Muffet through drugs and flights of fancy (it turns out she's a schizophrenic nd at one point does a stint in a mental institution), Dad through fishing in addition to drinking, and middle sister Margot through an eating disorder, drugs, and eventually a career as a model and actress, for which she changes the spelling of her name to ""Margaux."" When Mariel's 4 (in 1965), the family moves from California to Idaho, where her famous author grandfather, Ernest Hemingway, shot himself to death four months before she was born. Mariel feels awkward and isolated in school -- and is teased for being a rich kid whose name is actually on the school building. But she finds solace in nature, hiking with her dog, skiing, and riding horses. (Of nature she notes: ""No one can make you feel stupid when you're outside in nature by yourself."") Her life changes when her father has a heart attack (but survives) and again when her mother gets cancer (a disease she lives with for 20 years), and Mariel cares for them in ways beyond what she'd already been doing all her young life. The story goes through her first movie role --  break thanks to Margaux -- while she's still in high school.
","Invisible Girl covers territory common to many young-adult novels -- alcoholism, mental illness, suicide -- but it's all the more harrowing knowing this was the author's actual experience. Mariel Hemingway begins the narration in the baffled voice of a very young kid, and she basically maintains that voice throughout, puzzled by the bizarre behavior of the surrounding adults (she often seems like the only sane person in the family) and confusing, sometimes hurtful situations she mostly navigates on her own.
Kids will relate to the typical growing-up dilemmas and incidents, such as being the target of sibling or classmate rivalry, having a crush, and holding hands with a boy for the first time. And readers from troubled families can find hope in the fact that Hemingway survived hers and didn't repeat the familial pattern of substance abuse. The author not only offers a raft of ""Where to Go for Help"" resources at the back with website addresses and phone numbers (such as Alanon, Anxiety and Depression Association of America, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the International OCD Foundation, the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and so on) but also introduces each topic area in the context of her own experience. She advises kids that if they're going through something like she did or feeing the same way not to keep it to themselves; there are adults and organizations that can help.","Parents need to know that Invisible Girl, by actress, author, and mental health advocate Mariel Hemingway and Ben Greenman, is a harrowing yet hopeful memoir of growing up in a troubled family with a legacy of suicide, alcoholism, and mental illness. Hemingway offers a kid's-eye view of a chaotic, angry family wherein ""nobody's happy,"" charting her journey from infancy through early high school, trying to make sense of the behavior of those around her, from her hard-partying, always fighting alcoholic parents to her older sisters to the mean kids at school. Hemingway briefly mentions the suicide by gunshot of her famous grandfather Ernest Hemingway, her oldest sister's stay in a mental institution, eating disorders (one scene of binge eating followed by purging), obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, the death of a pet, her father's heart attack and survival, and her mother's cancer diagnosis and treatment. Her sister Margot hits her in the mouth with a baseball bat, knocking out her two front teeth. Mentions of drug-taking and lots of scenes of adults drinking, with young Mariel fixing her parents' drinks. One kiss as part of a planned third-grade stunt. Invisible Girl is being published at the same time as Hemingway's memoir for adults, Out Came the Sun: Overcoming the Legacy of Mental Illness, Addiction, and Suicide in My Family.

Ramona Blue,"Wry coming-of-ager explores sex orientation, family loyalty.","At six-foot tall and with hair always dyed the color that gave rise to her nickname, RAMONA BLUE would stand out anywhere. Add to that openly identifying as a lesbian, and you can bet everyone in her small Mississippi-coast town knows who she is. While Ramona's trying to make a long-distance romance work with Grace, a summer tourist, Ramona's childhood friend Freddie moves to town, and the two pick up their friendship right where it left off. As her friendship with Freddie deepens, Ramona starts to wonder if she ever really knew herself or what she wanted from life, especially once Freddie kisses her and she realizes she liked it.
","Julie Murphy brings a wry sense of humor to this thought-provoking coming-of-age story that explores family loyalty, responsibility, love, identity, and more. Teens will relate to Ramona Blue as she tries to figure out herself and her place in the world. Romance veterans will find that part of the storyline pretty predictable, but the colorful cast of characters and the skillfully evoked small-town life on the Mississippi Gulf coast keep the pages turning. Ramona's authentic voice keeps the reader rooting for her right to the end.","Parents need to know that Ramona Blue is a coming-of-age story by the author of Dumplin' and Side Effects May Vary. Ramona, 17, identifies as a lesbian and is romantically involved with a girl at first; two of her closest friends are also gay. Sexual-preference issues, such as how you know if you're gay and what happens when preferences change, are important but aren't by any means the central theme. Family life, growing up, and romance are stronger themes, and racial issues are also briefly explored. Some kissing and making out between same-sex and opposite-sex couples. An opposite-sex couple have sex; seeing the boy put on a condom is mentioned but the sex isn't described, and the boy's a great model for making sure the girl consents.

Seemingly trapped in a series of featureless hallways, she gathers around her other teen survivors who want to solve the deadly mystery that surrounds them.
","From its claustrophobic opening to its crackerjack action climax, this thriller will keep readers guessing right to the end. Author Scott Sigler creates a puzzle whose solution is both ingenious and plausible. Savage and her fellow survivors are complex, believable characters, and their antagonists are scary and formidable.

Midwinterblood,"Dark fantasy chronicles a love that transcends time, death.","MIDWINTERBLOOD by Marcus Sedgwick is a supernatural love story that combines elements of paranormal romance and reincarnation. It starts off in the near future -- 2073 -- with a journalist named Eric visiting Blessed Island, a remote and creepy place full of childless inhabitants who are rumored to hold the secret to health and longevity. While on assignment, Eric meets a beautiful woman named Merle and falls instantly in love, feeling as if he's met her before and has somehow always been in love with her. Without giving away too much, let's just say the island's home to many secrets, and readers are plunged into seven vignettes from the past, from the 21st century to ancient times, all dealing with other sets of Erics and Merles, the island, and the nature of love. 
","Critics have called Midwinterblood  Cloud Atlas for teens, and it's definitely an apt comparison. It's just 262 pages, but somehow Sedgwick packs in so much detail into each of the interconnected short stories. Told from the perspective of an archaeologist, pilot, painter, ghost, vampire, a Viking, and a king, the stories take place under a different Full Moon (the Flower Moon, the Grain Moon, the Blood Moon) and explore how Eric and Merle's souls have been intertwined for more than a millennium. If a lesser writer had tried to tackle such an ambitious storyline, it no doubt would've taken way upwards of 500 pages, but Sedgwick is more than up to the task of being concise but still breathtakingly eloquent.
Young readers who start the book need to be mature enough to handle the horror elements, like ritual sacrifice, and to understand how to connect the dots between the Full Moons, Blessed Island's mysterious orchid, and of course, the different incarnations of Eric and Merle. Each story is in itself a miniature horror or mystery tale, but at its root, these stories are about love, in its many forms, and how a passion so deep could transcend the boundaries of time and death. ","Parents need to know that Midwinterblood won American Library Association's Michael L. Printz Award for Excellence in Young Adult Literature. Written by English author Marcus Sedgwick, the fantasy novel is an epic tale of love through seven vastly different time periods -- from 2073 to the ncient past -- from the perspective of everything from a journalist and a painter to a vampire and a Viking. Told in vignettes, the book has been compared to Cloud Atlas in structure. There's some violence (the title is literal) in each of the stories, and characters die in sometimes grisly ways (a ritual sacrifice being the bloodiest, and a shooting being the saddest). Unlike other mature YA novels, there's not a good deal of sex and strong language. The author discusses or describes passion, desire, and love in all its forms throughout the book, but that's the point of the stories -- the power of love.

"The House with a Clock in Its Walls: Lewis Barnavelt, Book 1",Ten-year-old raises the dead in creepy Gothic classic.,"THE HOUSE WITH A CLOCK IN ITS WALLS is the new home of 10-year-old Lewis Barnavelt, whose parents have just died in an accident. It's 1948, and the house belongs to his uncle Jonathan, a stranger to Lewis, who has been warned that the man smokes, drinks, and plays poker. As it turns out, Uncle Jonathan is also a warlock (a male witch/sorcerer). So was the house's original owner, who may have something to do with the mysterious ticking that never goes away. Lewis is starting to enjoy his new life and even thinks he's made a friend -- but when the new friend turns mean, Lewis is desperate to impress him, so he goes to the cemetery on Halloween to raise someone from the dead. What could possibly go wrong? ","John Bellairs' tale of a 10-year-old orphan, his warlock uncle, and world-destroying villains back from the dead -- first in a long series -- has entertained and spooked readers since 1973. Edward Gorey's classic illustrations manage to be both creepy and endearing. There's more than a bit of ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" as young Lewis Barnavelt gets in way over his head raising people from the dead, and a strong sense of loving (if really strange) family and friends to set things right.","Parents need to know that The House with a Clock in Its Walls, originally published in 1973, is the first book in the multivolume Lewis Barnavelt series of creepy tales by the late John Bellairs.

The plot involves a fat, friendless kid who, in a desperate attempt to impress a kid in his class, swipes the books of his warlock uncle, and raises a dead person -- who, unluckily, is the former owner of his uncle's house, a villain bent on destroying the world. Witchcraft (as well as Ouija boards, Magic 8 Balls, etc.) pops up constantly, along with the sinister ticking of a clock throughout the house. The cartoonish darkness (enhanced by the dark cartoons of Edward Gorey) is balanced by a sort of homey sweetness and oddball humor as Lewis finds himself in a strange but loving family.

The Real Boy,"Shy boy fights monsters, makes friend in powerful fantasy.","Oscar's never felt like he belongs in the world of people. He feels much more comfortable staying with his cats in the magician's cellar and grinding herbs, occasionally venturing into the forest to collect plants. But then his magician master abandons him, and the healer's apprentice, Callie, befriends him. Meanwhile, the villagers and city dwellers are suddenly barraging Oscar with questions: Why did the magician leave? What kind of creature is killing people in the forest? Who is stealing magical items from the village? Most of all, why are the wealthy children of the city suddenly getting sick? Reluctantly at first, but with a growing sense of responsibility, Oscar joins forces with Callie to answer these questions and uncover the secrets of their world's magical history.
","THE REAL BOY weaves in elements of Pinocchio, The Sorcerer's Apprentice, and golem folktales to create an engaging original story. It's a tale about the follies of greed and grown-ups who think they deserve to have everything come easily to them without considering the many people who have less than they do.
However, kids don't need to draw parallels to the Occupy movement to enjoy this story: Oscar's a smart, likable character, and if his meekness at first seems like a weakness, Callie's bravery and confidence more than make up for it. As in author Anne Ursu's Breadcrumbs, the pacing is perfect, mixing exciting, magic-laden action with Oscar's inner development from a lonely boy into a brave friend.","Parents need to know that The Real Boy is an exciting fantasy by Anne Ursu (Breadcrumbs) with magic-laden action and a monster who destroys property and kills people, including a father figure (although not a very loving one).

Sheila Rae is the bravest person she knows, but one day she bites off more than she can chew, and her fainthearted younger sister, Louise, saves the day.

Album of Horses,An informational book for horse lovers of any age.,"ALBUM OF HORSES details the lives and characteristics of two dozen horse breeds, one to each chapter, and the last two chapters are short stories about horses. The animals profiled range from the appaloosa and the Arab to the Tennessee walking horse and the Welsh mountain pony.
Each chapter contains one full-page, full-color illustration of the breed under discussion. The softly shaded drawings show horses in a variety of actions: frolicking with children, prancing in a parade, hauling farm equipment. The margins throughout the book are illustrated with smaller black-and-white sketches that illustrate minor points in the text: a Spaniard atop his mustang, two farmers arguing over who has the best Belgian.
The book concludes with an author's note that describes her lifelong fascination with horses.

","This delicate, finely wrought story about a young Latina girl lays out the difficult circumstances of her immigrant family while celebrating her as a kid like any other. De la Peña seeds Carmela Full of Wishes with telling details. Her mom works as a housekeeper in a hotel, and her dad used to stand outside the home improvement store, hoping to be hired as a day laborer. Some of Carmela's wishes are simple (going to the Laundromat with her big brother) and some are not so simple (fixing her dad's immigration status so he can return to the family). And yet, Carmela's a kid, recognizable and relatable. She squabbles with her older brother, feistily stands up for herself, wishes for a candy machine, and jingles her bracelets, both to please herself and to needle her brother. And, as any kid might, she cries when she takes a tumble and crushes her dandelion.
Illustrator Christian Robinson's acrylic and collage illustrations work hand in hand with the text. The brown-skinned siblings and community members are appealingly expressive. Carmela's wishes are enshrined as papel picado, traditional Mexican decorations made of tissue paper with cutout shapes. Her most poignant wish, that her dad returns and embraces her, feels perfectly framed. And the human labor required for farming is underscored in the endpapers, which show scores of workers toiling in the fields.","Parents need to know that Carmela Full of Wishes is by Matt de la Peña and Christian Robinson, the same author-illustrator duo who teamed up for Last Stop on Market Street, which won both the Newbery Medal and a Caldecott Honor. This story is set in an immigrant community where workers labor in fields, and Carmela's dad's not living at home with the family because he needs ""his papers fixed."" Though her family's circumstances are hardscrabble, Carmela enjoys her daily pleasures: the jingle of her birthday bracelets, and the opportunity to go with her brother to the Laundromat. This sweet and spunky young girl is immensely likable, and readers will root for her wishes to come true.

 ","Kindergarten reading udiences will love this book, and will giggle throughout. SCRAMBLED EGGS SUPER! is much more than a mere list of invented avians.

The Lion & the Mouse,Retold fable with out-of-this-world art; a true keepsake.,"This is a visual retelling of the classic Aesop fable: A lion, awakened by a mouse climbing over him, catches the tiny animal in his mighty paw. The mouse appeals for mercy and the lion relents. Soon after, the lion is captured in a poacher's net. The mouse hears his anguished roars and comes to his aid, gnawing the ropes until the great creature is freed.
","Parents might expect the lack of text would make this an easy read -- but far from it. Readers are challenged to get involved in the story, to linger and explore each scene of this sumptuous book from acclaimed artist Jerry Pinkney. His illustrations, luminous in earthy golden tones, capture extraordinary nuance and expression in the mouse and the lion. The cover alone is arresting: Filling the front is the lion, looking a bit surprised as he glances to the left; flip the book over and there’s the mouse, in enlarged perspective, facing the lion with a friendly and fearless countenance.
Pinkney treats both the king of the jungle and the humble mouse with respect and affection. These are wild creatures, communicating with growls and squeaks, anxiously tensed bodies and fiercely snapping jaws. They are portrayed as adversaries, momentary friends, leaders of their families, and part of the diverse community in the Serengeti. In Pinkney's hands, this simple fable takes on new depth.
Full-page, expressive illustrations in watercolor and pencil are captivating.","Parents need to know that The Lion & the Mouse, which won the 2011 Caldecott Medal, is a beautifully illustrated version of Aesop's fable that's wordless, aside from the onomatopoeic sounds of the animals. Grown-ups who are unfamiliar with the fable may want to revisit it before reading this with their children.

The Goats,Camp tale gives readers a lot to think about.,"Two social outcasts at summer camp, Howie and Laura, are stripped and marooned by their campmates on an island in the lake. Possessed of intelligence and determination the other kids knew nothing about, they decide to get even by simply disappearing.
Through the difficult process of getting off the island, getting clothes, and surviving while avoiding the widespread search that is made for them by a camp more afraid of lawsuits than concerned about the cruelty practiced by its residents, they gradually and tentatively form an emotional bond that becomes the one thing they can rely on as the whole world seems to conspire against them.
","Some young readers may be frustrated by the ambiguous ending, even as they revel in the children's ongoing defiance of a hostile world. Unlike many survival stories, the main characters are not lost in a wilderness but are eking out their hunted existence at the edges of civilization, though Howie is mightily tempted to try to disappear into the woods and never be found. With glancing commentaries on the many and varied relationships between and among children and adults, the author gives readers much to ponder and discuss.
THE GOATS made quite an impression when it first came out in 1987. It takes place in the children's fiction favorite locale to examine the cruelty of mankind: summer camp. (In fact, it has the kind of grit shown in another well-known cruelty-in-camp novel, ""Bless the Beasts and Children."") But what sets it apart from others in its genre is the careful tenderness of the relationship between Howie and Laura, a deeply emotional relationship that never becomes sexual. It's finally that bond, portrayed with great delicacy and beauty by the author, that becomes the most meaningful part of their harrowing experience.","Parents need to know that, as part of a cruel joke, two young teens are stranded on an island together without any way to get back to camp -- and without any clothes. But even though they're naked, there's no hanky-panky; instead, the mortified outcasts work together to survive the experience and get revenge on the bullies who tried to humiliate them.

Navigating middle school gets even harder when Nick's bullies come back to school, his best friend has to play on another team, and his favorite rapping librarian keeps trying to get him to read all kinds of dumb books.

King of the Screwups,Enchanting stereotype-bending novel; teens only.,"Everyone loves Liam -- except his father, who has convinced him that he is nothing but a screwup. After his latest transgression (getting caught in his father's office with a girl) Liam's father kicks him out of the house. But rather than go to live with his rigid grandparents, he goes to stay with his father's brother, Aunt Pete, a cross-dressing, homosexual, glam-rocker and radio DJ who lives in a trailer park. Starting in a new school, Liam tries to become what his father wants him to be so that he'll be proud of Liam and allow him to come back home. But Liam just doesn't seem to be able to pull it off.
","This is a hilarious, and ultimately devastating, portrait of a kid who has been emotionally and verbally abused (along with his mother). We've all known kids like Liam -- bright, creative, talented, lovable -- who have fallen under the sway of someone who has convinced them that they're worthless, and they can't seem to see themselves through anyone else's eyes. Readers will be on Liam's side from the start. Even though the story is told in Liam's voice, readers will cotton on pretty quickly to the reality that Liam can't see and, so compelling is the author's way of telling the story, they will want to set him straight. But doing so is not so easy.
	With italicized flashbacks to pivotal moments in Liam's life, readers get to see him both inside and out, past and present. Even though he is popular in both his old and new schools, the author induces a powerful feeling of empathy for him, something unusual in young adult books, in which popularity almost always equates with mean and shallow. Equally unusual is straight Liam's fashion sense, so perfectly presented that it may have even boys taking a closer look at their wardrobes, and his gay uncle and friends, none of whom fit into a stereotype -- or anti-stereotype. Liam's father is a bit one-dimensional, but since it is Liam telling the story, that makes some sense. All of the other characters are fully-realized, realistic, and delightful. And though it is often laugh-out-loud funny, this is a book that packs an emotional wallop, and one that is fairly earned.
 From the Book:
	""My dad,"" I say defiantly. ""Because even though I don't look like him and I'm not smart like him, he's still my dad.""
	For a single second my father's chest swells. His eyes go from hard to soft. But then, before I have time to savor the moment, I screw up. And it's not just any screwup. It's the mother of all screwups.
	""I know,"" I tell the interviewer on national TV, ""because they got the paternally test and everything. I heard Mom say it to my nana. She said if we hadn't got the paternally test, she never would have believed it.""","Parents need to know that this novel for teens has many sexual references, and a scene in which a boy and girl undress each other, but are interrupted before they can have sex. There is also a fair amount of swearing and many approving references to clothing and shoe brands from the fashion-oriented teenaged main character.

"The Real McCoys, Book 1",Imaginative artwork makes fun detective story a joy to read.,"THE REAL MCCOYS introduces Moxie, an exuberantly confident fourth-grade detective who's in search of a replacement for her best friend (and crime-fighting partner), who moved away. It's a terrible time to have to work alone, too: The school's stuffed mascot, Eddie the Owl, disappears on the day of the big awards assembly. Moxie eagerly investigates, putting her reputation on the line to try to find Eddie and win the coveted Eddie Award. But figuring out whodunit keeps getting her in trouble -- and complicates her best friend search. To her surprise, her odd, quiet little brother may prove to be just the partner she needs.
","This remarkable new series brings a fresh style to the familiar girl-detective genre with a wonderfully spunky heroine and whimsical illustrations that make every page a delight to explore. In The Real McCoys, illustrator Robbi Behr shows Moxie's overactive imagination spilling over, onto, and through the energetic story written by her husband, Matthew Swanson. Silhouettes, dialogue bubbles, word art, and fanciful artwork are as lively and engaging as Moxie herself.
Confident and full of swagger, Moxie knows she'd be a better detective with a partner who has complementary talents. Her enthusiasm -- to solve the case and be recognized as a hero -- makes her a little sloppy, but her big heart and big goals win over even her exasperated principal. With its humor, wisdom, and bubbly art, this book is sure to appeal to even the most reluctant reader.","Parents need to know that The Real McCoys is the first in a well-illustrated series about a precocious crime-solving fourth-grader and her quiet but clever 7-year-old brother.

Yes Day!,Joyous charmer of a book celebrates a whole day of yeses.,"YES DAY! ""is my FAVORITE day of the year!"" proclaims the young narrator. When he asks for pizza for breakfast, the answer's yes. ""Can I clean my room tomorrow?"" Yes again. At the grocery, he gets to toss lots of sugary cereals into the cart, then asks for and gets an ice cream cone at the end of errands. Food fight? Yes.

Of course. And do they sometimes ask for outlandish things? Affirmative. But the requests author Amy Krouse Rosenthal features in the book are all within parental reach and feel sweet and connected. This kid doesn't ask to play video games or for kicks that break the bank. He asks for pizza for breakfast, lunch outside, and a friend to come for dinner. Well, OK, there's a food fight.

(You don't have to read Elijah to understand this one, but it adds to the experience.) The Madman of Piney Woods discusses race, the Civil War, the Irish immigration to Canada following the potato famine, and mental illness. It also shows violent acts during war battles, the death of an adult, the death of an animal, and domestic violence.

Fat Hoochie Prom Queen,"Fun main character, but lots of teen drinking too.","During a drunken high school party, Margarita accepts her rival's challenge to run for prom queen. Margarita gets so obsessed with beating Bridget -- a pretty but mean overachiever who also acts on TV -- that she starts to forget all the stuff she likes about her life and her large-and-loud self. But she comes to her senses when she finds out that her former friend is struggling with much more than winning the crown.
","This is a fun enough addition to the prom genre for mature teens, if not a particularly deep one. Margarita Diaz is different than most prom candidates: She is unapologetically fat, wears outrageous clothes, sometimes with feathers attached -- and can swear like a sailor in both Spanish and English. Also, unlike a lot of queen bee prom wannabes, she is actually nice to everyone. Her energy certainly breathes life into this rather meandering revenge story. Readers may laugh at some of the antics -- like when Madge wakes up to find that she has passed out drunk in a college football stadium next to an empty box of Krispy Kremes -- and they will certainly cheer when she tells off her arch-rival Bridget Benson.
	But by the time readers make it towards the end of the book, they may have forgotten what the whole point was. And this is exactly when the author decides to build Bridget's unfortunate -- and rather outrageous -- secret past (which includes a trashy drug-addicted mother who hits on Madge's gay best friend). All this -- of course -- leads to a very-scripted resolution between Madge and Bridget. Ultimately, it's Madge and her ebullient narration that keeps this story afloat.","Parents need to know that this book features plenty of drinking and swearing in both English and Spanish.

"Of Sorcery and Snow: The Ever Afters, Book 3","Magical, real worlds collide in action-packed sequel.","Rory Landon, 13, has completed two quests with fellow Characters training at Ever After School, yet she still doesn't know what her own Tale might be. But she has bigger problems to deal with: First, she and her friends are attacked by magical wolves in Golden Gate Park, and then she learns the Pied Piper has kidnapped 1,001 children from Portland and taken them to the Snow Queen, who has escaped her enchanted prison. When the tale is deemed too dangerous to pursue, she and her friends Lena and Chase join Miriam, whose brother was kidnapped, to take on the Snow Queen alone. As danger mounts, Rory realizes she'll need to spill her secrets to her family if she's to keep them safe -- but first she needs to survive this Arctic quest.
","Though this isn't one of the strongest books in the genre, it's fun to read and full of admirable, likable characters. OF SORCERY AND SNOW follows the formula of the preceding books in the Ever Afters series -- and in the hidden-magic-world genre. Many of the plot developments will feel familiar: The heroes are now on their own, without the guidance of their mentors, and Rory is increasingly concerned about the strange connection between herself and the Snow Queen (à la Harry Potter and Voldemort). The writing, intended to sound like an authentic teen voice, too often falls flat.
Rory and her friends are an inspiring group, capitalizing on one another's strengths and helping one another summon the courage to carry on. There's plenty of battle action and forward momentum to keep readers engaged.","Parents need to know that Of Sorcery and Snow ​is the third book in Shelby Bach's Ever Afters series. The fantasy violence in the book is rooted in dark fairy tales, including the ""Pied Piper of Hamelin"" story, as 1,001 children are spirited away from Portland and given up for lost by the teachers of Rory's magical school. Rory and her companions are in constant peril, from wolves, dwarves, Arctic cold, and the malevolent Snow Queen. Battle scenes are violent and intense, and Rory reluctantly makes her first kill. A key character is slain. Romance is in the air, too -- young characters are beginning to pair up as couples.

"Secret Origins: Story Thieves, Book 3","Comic-book shenanigans, big issues in zany sequel.","SECRET ORIGINS are big in the third installment of the Story Thieves series. Who is the terrible, shadowy arch-villain the Dark -- and how did he get this way? The mysterious Nobody, popping in and out of storylines -- same questions. Who -- and where and why -- is Bethany's long-lost father? Also, what does he have to do with superhero Captain Twilight? Once again, it's a crazy mash-up of ""real"" and ""fictional"" worlds as regular kid Owen (who still hopes to get superpowers on his 13th birthday) and world-hopping friend Bethany, along with some of their pals from earlier books, face many perils in the worlds of assorted comic books. Dodging killer robots, cosmic doom, and cranky authors, they're all about seeking a happy father-daughter reunion. But is that what the timeline has in store?
","Fans will be captivated by the latest adventures and shifting universes of Bethany and Owen, wonder what's become of absent characters, and look forward to wherever this zany series goes next. Author James Riley runs out of cliffs to hang plot threads from in this non-conclusion of the wacky Story Thieves ""trilogy,"" which proves to be just a prequel to many more installments to come. Between the references to the first two books and frequent mentions of the forthcoming Story Thieves: Pick a Plot, Secret Origins sometimes feels like a madcap infomercial.","Parents need to know that Secret Origins is the newest installment in the Story Thieves series nd Book 3 of a new three-volume box set. But if you're expecting a nice conclusion that resolves all the issues of Books 1 and 2, this is not that book. Instead, by the final page, author James Riley has all but run out of cliffs from which to hang plot threads, and he drops numerous broad hints that Story Thieves, so far, has been a mere prequel to untold future shenanigans -- especially the soon-to-be-released Book 4, Story Thieves: Pick a Plot. There's some cartoonish violence -- ray guns, robots, destroyed planets -- and a tad more realistic scary stuff, as when a cartoon villain snatches his creator away into another world. Some tween characters have a bit of romantic interest in other characters, but they're also at the ""romance ruins everything"" age when it comes to storylines. As with previous volumes, not every kid will love the anything-can-happen craziness, but the brave young heroes (now about age 12 and 13) and their sidekicks have a lot of appeal as they try to solve mysteries and foil villains.

Babe the Gallant Pig,"A lively, universal story of unlikely friendships.","Babe is not your ordinary pig: he's mannerly and intelligent--and one talented sheepherder! This delightful tale relates how one remarkable animal, with a little help from his friends, escapes the slaughterhouse to master an unusual skill and earn a secure place in hearts of readers.

","As animal fantasies go, BABE THE GALLANT PIG has earned the right to be compared favorably with the benchmark pig classic Charlotte's Web. It has all the necessary characteristics: suspense, kid appeal, plenty of emotion, and charismatic animal characters. Babe is the underdog -- er, underpig -- who, through sheer sincerity and genuineness, defies the odds in this heartwarming, farmyard equivalent of a rags-to-riches tale. It's an action-packed, universal story of unlikely friendships and even unlikelier triumphs, of forgiveness, determination, and the power that results from believing in oneself. Even the most disrespectful characters are ultimately reformed by Babe's positive example, providing a subtle yet effective lesson in virtuous behavior that won't be lost on readers of any age.
Part of the book's immense charm comes from the portions of dialogue that reflect rural British speech. In addition to deciphering the richly authentic dialect, some young readers will need assistance defining terms such as daft and cultural references such as dialing 999 when an emergency occurs. But don't let this be a deterrent; the UK influence will only serve to enrich the cultural, behavioral, and language lessons this remarkable book provides.","Parents need to know that the highly appealing story line is engaging, emotionally provocative, and at times suspenseful.

"Catherine, Called Birdy",Spirited novel offers warts-and-all view of the Middle Ages.,"CATHERINE, CALLED BIRDY describes a year in the life of an upper-class 13-year-old girl whose father wants to marry her off in exchange for increased wealth. When the book begins, Catherine has just been given a journal by her brother Edward, and in it, she tells about her daily life, her frustration over the limited choices and activities available to girls, and her powerful wish not to marry any of the suitors that her father favors. Catherine is a smart, high-spirited, rebellious young girl, and she comes up with all kinds of schemes to avoid marriage. She also expresses disapproval of brutish behavior of any kind, including the Edict of Expulsion (1290), which decreed that all Jews must leave England. As Catherine is pulled, kicking and screaming, toward her own adulthood, she learns a lot about the value of home and family, and she finds peace in the knowledge that no one can take her true self away.
","Catherine, Called Birdy holds special appeal for preteen girls who enjoy period fiction, as this Newbery winner accomplishes what the best historical novels do. It draws readers into a rich, well-realized world where the trappings are fascinatingly old-fashioned, but the characters are universal and relatable. This book teaches a great deal about England in 1290 -- revealing customs, gender roles, daily activities, religious views, etc. -- but does so within the framework of an engaging story about a smart, fierce, warmhearted girl that modern readers will love.","Parents need to know that Newbery-winning novel Catherine, Called Birdy describes the life of a 13th-century English upper-class family through the eyes of 13-year-old Catherine, the youngest child and the only girl when the book begins. Catherine writes regularly in a journal her brother Edward gave her, and her entries offer a richly detailed portrait of family life, customs, and lifestyle in her world. The book delves especially deeply into the impact of marriage customs and gender roles on young people of the period. Catherine dreams up plan after plan to avoid being pursued by suitors whom her father hopes will offer large sums for her hand in marriage. There are some violent (but not graphic) and disturbing scenes, including a difficult childbirth and a deadly infection resulting from a stabbing. Though there's no overt sexual activity, readers are made aware that unmarried characters have sex, and a 12-year-old girl is impregnated by her fiance.

How High the Moon,Girl seeks family secrets in hopeful Jim Crow-era tale.,"It's 1943, and 12-year-old Ella and her friends Myrna nd Henry are living in the Jim Crow South. Ella, the main character of HOW HIGH THE MOON, lives with her grandmother, who's taken in Myrna from her unwed mother. Ella doesn't know who her father is -- though everyone suspects he's white. Her mother, Lucy, lives in Boston, where she works in a shipbuilding factory and pursues her dream of a singing career. Ella is ecstatic to get a letter from her mother inviting her to come stay with her. But once there, she finds Helen, the roommate who cuddles up in Mama's bed when Ella wants to be there. And between work at the shipyard and performing at nightclubs, Mama is hardly ever home. She doesn't get around to enrolling Ella in school, so the girl spends long, boring days by herself in the small apartment until Lucy takes off for New York and sends Ella back to South Carolina. And no one, including her mother, will tell Ella nything more about her father than that he went to California. The same day she gets back to South Carolina, one of Ella's friends, George Stinney, is arrested and charged with murder.
","This heartfelt tale about childhood in the Jim Crow South brings us  girl who finds a sense of family despite an absent mother, a mystery father, and a cruel society. How High the Moon, the debut novel from Karyn Parsons, grew out of a conversation the author had with her mother. Parsons wondered how her mother could claim she had a happy childhood when she grew up in the South under Jim Crow. The subplot about the boy who's wrongfully executed comes from a real legal case. The strength of the novel is the character of Ella: Her close relationship with her grandmother, longing to be with her mother, and desperation to know who her father is all ring true.
There are two main weaknesses. First, the author chose to have each of the three children narrate chapters. However, this isn't quite balanced, since Ella's clearly the main character and the other narrators and their perspectives are not as well developed. This technique seems like a clumsy way of providing backstory. Second, a few of the Jim Crow stories seem like rehashed scenes from To Kill A Mockingbird. ","Parents need to know that How High the Moon is a hopeful historical novel set in South Carolina and Boston during the mid-1940s. The three main characters, middle school kids Ella, Myrna, and Henry, are exposed to daily loss of dignity living under Jim Crow laws, as well as serious injustice: A 14-year-old boy is executed for murder after a forced confession and improper trial. There's a scene where children discover the bodies of a man, woman, and child hanging from trees after being lynched. There are several scenes of bullying, both physical assault and mean language. One boy bullies another in school and that boy is slapped by his brother within eyeshot of other people, who do not intervene. Some white boys catch Ella in the woods and knock her to the ground. Ella's mother is in a lesbian relationship, revealed when the girl finds the two women cuddling together in bed s they sleep. There's a scene where Ella's mother and her companion drink whiskey, and another where Ella finds glasses with whiskey in them.

Jacob and Emma narrowly escape the London destruction, managing to evade the hollowgast that's hot on their trail. Jacob gains more control over his special power, and with the help of Addison, a talking dog, he and Emma begin the almost hopeless pursuit of their kidnapped friends and especially Miss Peregrine, their ymbryne matriarch. A complicated series of adventures takes them through one narrow escape after another, through Victorian England, Devil's Acre, and strange loops to a medieval fortress and finally the Library of Souls. They face bloodthirsty hollowgasts, revengeful white-eyed wights, evil peculiars, and the dangers of a drug-dependent despicable society full of individuals who would do anything for their next vial of ambrosia. People and peculiars are not always who they seem, and several unexpected twists lead to an epic battle in the Library of Souls nd the final resolution of Jacob and Emma's story. ","Action-packed and accented by strange photos, this final book in Ransom Riggs' gothic thriller trilogy is complicated, spine-tingling, violent, and romantic. It's also well written and fun to read. The war between good and evil is the stuff comic books are made of, the vocabulary reads like a classic novel, and the unique story will engage anyone who loves science fiction, dystopian novels, and/or cannibalistic monsters, evil scientists, and heroes with superhuman talents. Some readers may find the first part slow going as Riggs sets up pieces of a complicated plot. However, midway, the action and excitement pick up, and those pieces fall into place. Battles ensue, death and destruction are narrowly avoided, happy surprises follow hopeless disasters, and vice versa. Good is bad and bad is good s the story twists and turns through loops, tunnels, turrets, sewage-laden canals, and fantastical rooms and worlds on its way to a final resolution. Whew! What a journey! Definitely one readers will not soon forget. ","Parents need to know that Library of Souls, the final thriller in Ransom Riggs' gothic trilogy, completes the heroic adventures of Jacob and Emma as they try to rescue their friends, the world of the peculiars, and their budding teen romance. It should be read after the other two books (Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, Hollow City). The story is clever, adventurous and tense nd accented with bizarre photos, as are the others. It's a basic good-vs.-evil story with a few unexpected twists and turns, packed with violence, monsters, evil characters, drug-crazed simpletons as well as some kissing and yearning. Director Tim Burton's film adaptation of Book 1 is set for a March 2016 release.

My Journey to the Stars,Exciting memoir rockets future astronauts to space.,"MY JOURNEY TO THE STARS, a memoir by astronaut Scott Kelly, begins when he's on his way home after spending a year on the International Space Station, then veers back to his childhood years in New Jersey. He has n identical twin, Mark, who also became an astronaut, which becomes significant in their careers. A ""terrible"" student, Kelly was inspired when he happened upon the book The Right Stuff about the first NASA astronauts. ""That book changed my life forever,"" since having a dream gave Kelly something concrete to work for. A stint in the Navy as a jet pilot led to his career at NASA and his yearlong mission on the ISS, conducting space-age experiments in its lab.
","Scott Kelly describes his descent back to Earth after a year in space as a ""wild ride,"" and in this exciting autobiography, readers ride along and learn about his inspiring career with NASA. Since the book spans childhood through his time as an astronaut, there's a lot for kids to relate to. Kelly offers personal information that might not at first seem pertinent to his career -- his parents fought loudly nd divorced -- but then he talks very concretely about how he managed to turn negatives into positives. He frankly admits he was a terrible student who couldn't sit still, until he got a dream and was able to make a step-by-step plan to achieve it -- info that could be encouraging and useful for kids who struggle academically. Throughout, he urges readers to take risks and push themselves to aim high.
The book's also chock-full of science information, easy to digest in the personal memoir format. It touches on space missions, gravity, the effects of a prolonged space stay, research that utilizes twins, growing plants in space, and lots more. The art, heavy on photographs, is supplemented with illustration. All in all, this is a solid book on a topic of strong interest to lots of kids.","Parents need to know that My Journey to the Stars is a picture book autobiography by Scott Kelly, the first NASA astronaut to spend nearly a year in space on the International Space Station.

"Nightblood: The Frostblood Saga, Book 3",Lovers' quarrels stifle this dark fantasy finale.,"In NIGHTBLOOD, Ruby, King Arcus, Prince Kai, and a contingent of Fireblood Masters sail back to the Frost Court for reinforcements. With the Fireblood Queen's blessing, Fireblood and Frostblood will fight together against the trickster god Eurus and his mind-controlling Minax demons. All they need are more powerful Frostbloods and the translation of a sacred text to find Eurus' secret island. When they pull into port, they realize the first task isn't that simple. In Arcus' short absence, some of the court has turned against him. Ruby decides that the only way to convince them that the Minax is a serious threat is to show what it can do. In a gathering of nobility, she unleashes a Minax that clings to her and lets it infect their minds. It's effective and convincing -- until the Minax decides it's the one in control, not Ruby. Arcus arrives in time to save the court, but after what they saw, will they be willing to help the Firebloods?
","A romantic storyline usurps the fantasy power of this finale with a vengeful god, fire- and frost-wielding mortals, and mind-control demons. If you stir the pot with just these fantasy elements, there's a chance to overdo. Especially when there are lso prisoners to rescue and armadas giving chase and two cults to keep track of -- one that wants only Frostbloods to survive, one that wants no one at all to have magic. Sounds exciting. It is exciting, but it could have been executed much better if the scenes of lovers' quarrels didn't dominate.
Ruby and Arcus are already paired up by Nightblood, and still they fill chapters with petty fights about whether Ruby still likes Prince Kai or whether Arcus is mad at Ruby for her simply following her instincts. This is wasted space that could have been better used to explore the fantasy elements and set up the finale in a more dynamic way. Things wrap nicely in the end but could have been executed with more care.","Parents need to know that Nightblood is the third romantic fantasy book in the Frostblood Saga. Normally Frostbloods -- those who can wield ice -- and Firebloods -- fire wielders -- are enemies, but they fight a common enemy here. The vengeful god Eurus is bent on controlling the world with dark spirits. So there's much about overcoming evil in this series finale, and a lot of fighting evil with magical fire and ice. Battles and skirmishes end in many deaths, but with little described in detail. A character close to the main character dies. Many injuries are healed with magical intervention. There's some drinking by a monk nd pirates, and a lot of kissing and groping and a naked bathing scene in a hot spring that doesn't get too steamy. Be ready to discuss the relationship between Ruby and Arcus. Ruby may be a strong female hero who follows her instincts, but she spends a lot of time worrying that her actions will make her kingly boyfriend mad. Arcus does indeed get mad and a little possessive.

Louisa soon wants to escape, but she's held back by the fear that her friend, the handsome Lee, will be unjustly executed for a crime he did not commit.
","Deals with the devil can make for diabolical plot twists, and this novel in the Gothic tradition provides some satanic reversals. The premise of House of Furies is spelled out right in the introduction. This is a shame, because it's a secret worth holding onto for a chapter or three. Nevertheless, author Madeleine Roux does a fine job of generating creepy suspense while her feisty protagonist, Louisa, seeks a way to escape Coldthistle House and its murderous residents. There''s humor and horror, with a light dusting of romance. There's also  satisfying twist that hints at more occult shenanigans to come.","Parents need to know that House of Furies is the start of a new horror series by Madeleine Roux (Asylum).

Josephine Wants to Dance,Giddy tale of a can-do dancing kangaroo.,"Instead of jumping around all day, Josephine the joey (young kangaroo) imitates the dance moves of other animals. One day she spots a poster for the ballet and heads into town to watch, learning everything she sees through a window. When the prima ballerina can't dance the day of the performance, guess who leaps up to the challenge?
","Get ready for some jumping around at story time -- the energy in this book is infectious. Bruce Whatley's fantastically spry illustrations show Josephine the joey leaping from one page to the next, head tossed jubilantly and confidently this way and that, giant feet pointed, sweeping, and kicking. Author Jackie French seems to have a real love for her native Australian creatures, giving them personality and whimsy.
Josephine never seems discouraged -- just excited to try something new, a wonderful outlook for kids who are just starting school. She's so confident she can step in for the ballerina that the humans barely think twice as they make the biggest ballet shoes imaginable. And, of course, she looks pretty adorable in a pink tutu.","Parents need to know that this energetic story may get kids up and dancing -- just like the audience in the story right after they see their very first dancing kangaroo. So it may not be the best wind-'em-down bedtime book.

"Bees, Snails, and Peacock Tails",Explore nature's patterns and shapes with preschoolers.,"Betsy Franco uses simple rhymes to entrance kids into noticing the everyday patterns that surround us in the natural world. From a delicate spiderweb to a v-shaped flock of geese flying south for the winter, there are shapes and patterns everywhere -- you just need to know where to look. Each two-page spread offers up the shapes and patterns for one kind of animal. There are other interesting little facts embedded in the poems, too -- like that it's the boy peacock who's so fancy (news that's sure to startle gender-rigid preschoolers) or that starfish ""see"" with eyespots at the end of their arms.
","Preschoolers like their books to rhyme, and adults like it when the author doesn't have to reach too much to make the rhymes work; everyone's needs are met here. This is a well-written and interesting nonfiction book. Preschoolers love to share little bits of information so kids will appreciate the interesting factoids. They will also like being able to trace the patterns and shapes in the arresting pictures.
The illustrations by Caldecott Honor winner Steve Jenkins are vibrant and detailed. Using a layered paper technique, he creates a world that seems three dimensional and realistic while retaining a simplicity that is extremely appealing. The very littlest readers, who might not have the patience for the text, will still enjoy the book for the pictures and parents can help them find the animals' hexagons, diamonds and ""graceful Vs.""","Parents need to know that that the gorgeous pictures in this book are more than entertaining, they're also educational.

"Otherworld, Book 1","Virtual reality thriller has old theme but fun, twisty plot.","At the start of OTHERWORLD, Simon can't understand why his best friend, Kat, won't have anything to do with him anymore. She's hanging with a different crowd at school, and her controlling stepfather warns Simon to keep his distance. Kat is gravely injured in a freak accident, and then outfitted with sophisticated virtual reality gear designed to keep her mind engaged while her body is comatose. Simon vows to search the online realm known as Otherworld until he finds Kat and rescues her avatar, reuniting her mind and body. Soon Simon is traveling between realms, trying to stay alive online lest his physical body die from the trauma it experiences.
","Cyberthrillers seem to be making a comeback, and this variant of the old ""is it a game, or is it reality?"" gambit tries to find new juice in the genre. It isn't always successful, relying on standard fantasy tropes and scenes of corporate skullduggery, but Otherworld has lots of appeal with its snarky dialogue and twisty plotting. The book would benefit from a stronger presence from Kat, who seems too much the standard damsel in distress, but Simon is a protagonist worth following through a series of online adventures.
Readers familiar with cyberpunk may wish for a newer wrinkle, but many more will be primed for the next book in the series from Jason Segel and Kirsten Miller.","Parents need to know that OTHERWORLD is the first volume in a new sci-fi series by actor Jason Segel and veteran writer Kirsten Miller, authors of the Nightmares! series of middle-grade thrillers. Here a teen named Simon seeks to rescue his best friend, Kat, who's stuck in a dangerous virtual realm. Much of the action takes place online, where the characters fight to survive attacks by magical beings, while their comatose bodies wait for their return in the real world. Strong language includes frequent variants of ""s--t,"" a few instances of ""hell,"" ""damn,"" ""a--hole,"" ""bastard,"" and ""goddamn,"" and one or two uses of ""f--k"" in especially stressful situations.

Curious George,Michievous monkey's antics will have kids laughing.,"What happens when you take a curious monkey out of the jungle and set him loose in the big city? When the monkey is Curious George, the answer is chaos ... and a whole lot of fun! It's one adventure after another until he is arrives happily at the zoo.
 ","George's insatiable curiosity -- and children's understanding of what could go wrong -- make this book such a fun read. This classic from 1941 has been criticized in recent times for seeming to condone colonialism, as it portrays the white Man in the Yellow Hat taking George from the African jungle to the big city with intentions of ""civilizing"" him.
Author-illustrator H. A. Rey takes care to fill every other page with a colorful cartoon-like drawing. One outstanding picture shows an aerial view of George holding balloons and floating over the city. However, sometimes a series of thumbnail pictures appears on one page and can confuse young children.","Parents need to know that Curious George is the first book in a series that's been popular for generations and has spawned an animated TV show and apps. George's antics will have kids laughing. The writing is simple and direct, and the art is charming in this adventure tale, first published in 1941. Some kids may be a little troubled by George's sad expression when he's whisked away from his jungle home -- as well as when he lands in jail for accidentally calling the fire department. Parents will want to reassure them that they won't get locked up for minor infractions.

Black Boy,Moving autobiography reveals brutality of Jim Crow South.,"BLACK BOY details the formative years of Richard Wright, a best-selling author and activist who grew up during the 1920s in Mississippi and Tennessee. The book reveals the extreme emotional and physical depravation of Wright's childhood -- hunger and the threat of violence were Wright's most constant companions. After his father abandons the family, Richard, his mother, and his brother move from town to town, in and out of relatives' homes, in a constant struggle to survive. Richard wants to be educated, but never knows year to year whether he will be able to enroll in school -- because he can't afford the books he needs, hasn't proper clothing, or has to care for his ailing mother. Yet, somehow Wright managed to retain some semblance of self esteem, and a keen awareness of the injustice of racial prejudice. Writing from an adult perspective, he shows clearly the desperation born of bigotry and brutality, and the ways that learning and ideas helped to liberate him.
","Black Boy is painful to read; the emotional and physical assaults Wright suffered as a child are as upsetting to parents as they will be to children. However, this is an extremely revealing, eloquent, and important book. There is so much to learn from Wright historically, and in our ongoing effort to understand the long-term effects of racial prejudice and child abuse. Black Boy continues to be an enormously effective and moving autobiography, and it's a must-read for students learning about the Jim Crow South.","Parents need to know that Richard Wright's Black Boy is a brutal and disturbing portrait of this best-selling, award-winning author's experiences in the American South during the 1920s. Hungry, degraded, and living under the constant threat of violence and death, Wright somehow emerged as a self-respecting man of ideas, and so his story is as inspiring as it is upsetting. The book, which reads like a novel, shows numerous incidents of white-on-black and black-against-black violence -- from children being ""whipped"" to teens assaulting each other, to adults being shot and killed. There's some profanity, but most foul is the combination of cruel language with racial slurs (""black bastard,"" ""stupid n----r""). Also disturbing is Wright's indoctrination to alcohol as a child. Younger teens may need some guidance to comprehend the effects of Wright's living with so much deprivation and under the constant threat of physical harm.

Monster Hunters: Nightmare Academy: Book 1,Familiar and predictable but lots of fun.,"Charlie discovers that he has the power to bring monsters into our world from the Netherworld -- in fact his power may be the strongest ever -- so he is taken to Nightmare Academy to learn how to control his power and use it to help the Nightmare Division keep the world free of monsters. But once there he accidentally opens a portal to Barakkas, one of the Named, the four most powerful monsters, and discovers a plot by the Named to unleash the monsters of the Netherworld on Earth.
","Lorey joins the ranks of screenwriters who've made the transition to children's books nd found that their cinematic skills stand them in good stead in their new endeavor. Let's grant all the obvious criticism right up front: Yes, this bears more than a passing similarity to the story of another boy who goes off to boarding school to learn magic. Yes, the plot is derivative and predictable, and the characters are flat clichés. But if the variations are intriguing, the action exciting, and the pacing tight, it hardly matters. This book is just fun.
	Visual imagination, crisp pacing, and clear plotlines are helpful, if not essential, for both, and Lorey has those down pat. This may not be great literature, but it's well-written, and does what it sets out to do quite well. Many kids, including some who are nearing but not quite ready for Rowling, and others who are reluctant readers, will find lots to enjoy here.
 From the Book:
	Towering over him, it raised its long, curved stinger, preparing to strike. A thick, poisonous-looking fluid oozed from the tip. Charlie's knees went watery and he dropped to the ground.
	""Don't,"" he said.

Bog Child,Lyrical but realistic; teens may need Irish history lesson.,"Fergus lives in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. He's got a lot going on: He knows his exams are his only ticket out, but he's also dealing with his brother, an imprisoned IRA fighter, who is on a hunger strike, and he's being pressured into secretly carrying mysterious packages back and forth across the border. Fergus and his uncle discover a body buried in a bog, which turns out to be nearly 2000 years old. Archeologists arrive to argue over the find and which country owns it, and Fergus finds himself falling for one of their daughters. He also starts having strange dreams about the life of the girl whose body they found. Includes an author's note that gives a brief look at the book's context.
 
","This is a lovely book about an unlovely time and place -- a grim Northern Irish town in the early '80s. Fergus and his family are appealing characters living through exceptionally difficult events, and the parallel story of the long-ago life of Mel, the bog child, seen through Fergus' troubled dreams, adds resonance and depth to the story. Especially touching are Fergus' forbidden friendship with a young British border guard, and his family's division and desperation over his brother Joe's hunger strike: ""Oh, Joe. The consequences. On you, on us, on all of us. Did you think of them? Did you?""
 
	Basing the story on real events at the Long Kesh prison, the late author, British herself, assumes that her readers know all about the Troubles, and understand the terminology of Provos and Unionists and Sinn Fein. She helps them out with only the briefest of Author's Notes, and no glossary. American teens will need some help with context, either by explaining it to them or pointing them toward researching it for themselves. Without that context the story is still readable, but makes a whole lot less sense.
 

  ","Parents need to know that teens smoke, drink, get drunk, make out, and come close to having sex. The story takes place during the Troubles in Northern Ireland, and is based on real events at the Long Kesh prison.  There are bombings and suicidal hunger strikes, and while he author's notes provides a little context, readers will need some help understanding the Troubles and the terminology of Provos and Unionists and Sinn Fein. Even so, this book may inspire teens to learn more about this painful time in history. See our recommended media for other Irish stories to consider.

Glass,Intense poems of meth addiction; read with teens.,"This is a sequel to Hopkins' popular Crank, a book she based on her daughter's battle with the drug. This installment is also told through spare verse, and it also centers on Kristina. At the beginning of the book, Kristina gets back into methamphetamine -- smoking a higher grade called Glass -- and quickly loses control, starting a new dangerous downward spiral. This time around things are much darker for Kristina. She is kicked out of her home, loses custody of her infant son, and eventually begins committing crimes with her addict boyfriend in order to support their habits.
","While young readers may be drawn in by the titillating material, Hopkins just has  remarkable gift for conveying lots of story, character, and emotion through her simple lines. Readers will find themselves caring for Kristina and her family, even though they know she is doomed.
Hopkins' daughter is a recovering meth addict and this book is based on her experiences -- another fact that may draw teen fans. Of course, careful readers will understand that Hopkins is making a point about addictions: It doesn't end when the book does.","Parents need to know that this book is about a girl's drug addiction: Not only does Kristina use meth constantly, but eventually she also deals it for the Mexican Mafia. There are some fairly graphic depictions of sex, including a first orgasm and having sex with more than one partner. Kristina's drug use gets her kicked out of the house; eventually she loses custody of her young son and begins committing crimes to support her habit (even robbing her mother). By the end of the book, Kristina is pregnant again.

Song of the Crimson Flower,Absorbing companion story to Asian-inspired fantasy series.,"In SONG OF THE CRIMSON FLOWER, Lan's life so far (she's 18 now) has been very privileged and sheltered. She's known Bao most of her life, although not very well. Bao's a perfectly nice young man, but his lowly social status kept them from interacting much. When Lan learns of Bao's role in shattering all her dreams of her future, Lan's treatment of Bao will both tear them apart and set them on a long, difficult journey together. Along the way they'll have to find the mysterious river witch, convince the Empress that they're not spies or smugglers, and bring down a ruthless leader who only craves more power. Oh, and lift the curse that's been placed on Bao before it becomes permanent. Along the way they'll learn surprising truths about family, love, and what it takes to build a life together.
","Fantasy fans, especially those who liked the Rise of the Empress series, will will enjoy delving into this richly imagined fantasy world with a distinct Asian flair. Song of the Crimson Flower features magical abilities, a mysterious witch, blossoming romance, a ruthless leader, and the adventure of a lifetime. It's a separate story with different characters from the Empress series. Although it's set in the same world and a few characters from that series appear here, you don't need to read the other two books first to fully enjoy this one.
Author Julie C. Dao continues to create relatable, colorful characters and put them in a vivid and richly imagined world. The satisfying ending leaves the door open for continuing stories about Lan and Bao. A strong plot element involving illegal drugs and mild violence make it best for teens and up.","Parents need to know that Julie C. Dao's Song of the Crimson Flower is a fantasy companion story to Rise of the Empress series. It stands on its own, but a few characters from that series are in this book so reading it first will deepen the reader's appreciation of the those characters. It's not as dark as the Empress books and concentrates more on blossoming romance and adventure. Violence includes battles and a sickness called the ""bloodpox"" that include mentions of blood, pain, and suffering with gory descriptions. Sexy stuff is fairly light with a couple of kisses briefly described and a couple of embraces that are interrupted. The romance part is mostly the growing feelings between Lan and Bao. A major plot element involves a poppy-based, highly addictive substance that's illegal, but one community continues to make and export it. The story takes the strong stance that any potential benefits from the substance are far outweighed by the damage that addiction to it does to their society. Lan and Bao are positive role models, and other characters and locations represent a variety of Asian-inspired cultures.

Getting Near to Baby,Moving story of grief and recovery.,"When Baby dies, tragedy affects everyone in the family differently. They must find their own paths through grief, in their own time, and this may not match another's schedule or needs. The wisdom of one family member in supporting these differences results in healing. This moving story of grief and recovery is told in an eccentric, nonlinear fashion.
 ","The moving story line highlights the shattering effect of grief in 12-year-old Willa Jo Dean's family. It echoes Willa Jo's fragmentary process of working through grief over her baby sister's death and its debilitating effects on Mom. It also adds to the satisfaction of the family reunion at book's end. Some children may have a hard time with the sad topic and the slow pace of the story.
Willa Jo is portrayed as a spunky girl fighting to help her sister, while struggling to be of help to Mom, by living with rule-making Aunt Patty. Willa Jo sounds adult, partly as a result of the book's engaging Southern voice and partly because she's the older sister.","Parents need to know that the beautifully handled nonlinear plot and the vivid language keep readers engaged, but the slow, sad story makes it less appealing.

She might not have all the answers to life's questions, but she's positively sure that writing music with Lea is the best thing in the world. But when Lea dies in a car accident and she's sent to live with her aunt in Hawaii, Rumi doesn't know how to begin coping with her grief, and she's angry at her mom for abandoning her. Without music, Lea, or her mom, Rumi turns to her aunt's neighbors: Kai, the cute surfer with a laid-back attitude, and Mr. Watanabe, an 80-year-old man who's dealt with his own tragedies.

When Francie disappears into the swamp, Cort and Liza follow, and soon all three children are fighting for their lives. One catastrophe follows another as the hurricane worsens, and Cort must decide the best course of action if any of them is to survive the night.
","A great choice for reluctant readers who like human-vs.-nature conflicts described in clear, compelling language, this tale of three children lost in a hurricane packs a wallop. Watt Key (Alabama Moon) clearly knows his way around the Gulf Coast, and in TERROR AT BOTTLE CREEK, he describes life on the edge of a swamp with sensitivity and precision. The mundane details of the early chapters ground the intense action of the later ones. The narrative tension mounts steadily, and Key ends most chapters with a cliffhanger to keep readers riveted.

Dork Diaries 2: Tales from a NOT-SO-Popular Party Girl,"Protagonist shows more depth here, but still pretty shallow.","This book leaves off one day after the first book ends, just after Brandon asks Nikki to be his science lab partner. This volume focuses on the Halloween dance, which happens to be the same night Nikki has promised to work at a ballet party hosted by her little sister's friend. Readers will recognize the cast of characters here, including mean girl MacKenzie, who is in charge of the dance. When MacKenzie suddenly resigns from her job, the Halloween dance might get cancelled -- and if MacKenzie's plan works, the entire school will blame Nikki. Can Nikki and her friends figure out a way for the dance to go on? And can Nikki juggle going to the dance with her friends, secretly being Brandon's date -- and fulfilling her promise to work at the ballet party?
","The protagonist in this latest installment in the series continues to be dramatic, self-absorbed, and popularity-obsessed, but she does show some growth here. Nikki has a fleeting moment of compassion for her little sister when she freezes on stage, shows leadership by organizing the school dance -- and learns basic lessons about honesty and how to be a better friend when her best buddies discover her multiple commitments on the night of the dance. Even so, readers will have a hard time finding a character to relate to. Nikki overreacts to everything, and her ""woe is me"" attitude, constant irritation with her little sister, and flighty decision-making quickly grow tiring. Meanwhile, her nemesis MacKenzie remains a stereotypical enemy.

Hearing this, Calder's friends, Tommy, Petra, and Mrs. Sharpe, arrive to help with the investigation.
","Chasing Vermeer was a tightly woven, and the sequel, The Wright 3, was entertaining, but THE CALDER GAME makes it clear that the author went one book too far.
Codes are still here, but have nothing to do with the plot. Pentominoes have become little more than something for Calder to fiddle with.

They've even tried (but failed) to restore an old plane in the hope of making a daring escape from their troubled lives in a North Carolina town. Luke's mother has little interest in providing even the most basic necessities for him and his 5-year-old twin brothers, and Toby's father is an alcoholic petty criminal who routinely beats him. Their new escape plan revolves around the wrestling scholarship Luke has received. Toby will follow Luke to Iowa, although he has no idea how he'll pay for his tuition or where he'll live. As the story unfolds, each begins a first love relationship --  Luke with Annie, who does everything she can to support him and help out with the twins; nd Toby with Lily, a woman in her 20s that he meets in a bar. Lily sets in motion the events that will end with Luke committing murder. The letters Luke writes to Toby from prison give readers a heartbreaking look at his life on Death Row. He writes of his feelings of isolation and emotional desolation, a friend named Eddie, who's scheduled for execution, a nun who assures him that everyone is capable of a transformation, and a lawyer who believes his sentence was an injustice and tells him that people are working to get him a new sentencing hearing. Readers must wait until the very end of the novel to find out who Luke murders and why he did it.

But all those hopes are dashed when Luke is convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The story unfolds in alternating chapters: Luke's letters from prison to Toby and a third-person account of the months that led up to the murders. Toby's world is often violent (a beating by his father is vividly related), and the details of several murders are noted rather than described. Both boys have first sexual encounters that are briefly glimpsed, and profanity is used often and casually (""f--k,"" ""a--hole,"" ""s--t,"" ""goddamn,"" ""hell"").

Some of these dares force the girls to betray one another to keep their own painful secrets hidden, and soon accusations are flying. Meanwhile, the Fall Festival is approaching, a weekend celebration during which -- over the years -- three other pretty, popular, rich girls have drowned in the ocean. Will one of the three protagonists be joining the Lost Girls club?
","This cinematic book races from a gripping first scene to a dramatic conclusion. And the unfolding plot reveals plenty of scandalous details: There's a kidnapping victim, a pyromaniac with anger issues, a possible romance between step-siblings, and plenty of other salacious material that will keep readers speed reading through to the end.
Of course, close readers won't be surprised by the rather overwrought conclusion, but the author certainly leaves enough room to explore more mysteries in the next installment. In the end, Truth or Dare isn't a book that will stick with readers in any deep way, but teens looking for some light reading to keep them entertained on vacation may want to throw this one in the beach bag.","Parents need to know that Truth or Dare is about teen girls who are targeted for dangerous dares, which ultimately result in the death of two young women. Other characters are drugged, drowned, hospitalized, and more -- but while the violence is pervasive, it's never very visceral. There's some kissing and taboo flirtation between a girl and her new stepbrother. Characters also throw parties and drink until drunkenness. One protagonist takes prescription anxiety pills and ends up in the hospital after taking too many. In the end, this is mostly titillating fluff, though it could open up some thoughtful discussions about popularity or even how this book compares to similar titles like Pretty Little Liars or The Lying Game.

"Oh, the Thinks You Can Think!",Dr. Seuss in is psychedelic mode here.,"Dr. Seuss in is psychedelic mode here: The candy colors flash and swirl as if on fire, the creatures bend the imagination, and the urge to think freely runs unfettered. Just consider the wild names given to creatures--guffs, snuvs, bloogs, zongs, jibboos--and places: Da-Dake, Na-Nupp, and the wonderful Stairs in the Night. Here is creative thinking in overdrive.
","Dr. Seuss casts off from the shore of ordinary thinking and invites his readers along to spend some time thinking freely, vibrantly, and passionately. Make connections where there haven't been any before, he suggests; go ahead and make things up.
As most always, what Seuss has to say is a breath of fresh air, blowing the cobwebs out of the old imagination. But here it feels especially zany and full of spice, and his colors have gone electric and dazzling: candy-striped tree trunks, purple skies and elephants, magenta gloves and trees, and multicolored creatures. It is a breath-stealing ride, not to mention a sharp exercise in sounding letters into words. There are pages here that throw a jimjam or two: One 4-year-old melted a little deeper into the sofa when the shadowy jibboo appeared in the night street, but the shivers were more delicious than scary.","Parents need to know that the verse here is roaring, the art typically full of strange animals, and the call to free your mind highly appealing.

"Of Enemies and Endings: The Ever Afters, Book 4","Strong finish for modern, fast-paced fairy tale-fantasy.","Rory Landon is dreading her 14th birthday, which is fated to usher in her final confrontation with the Snow Queen -- an encounter Rory may not survive. As the Snow Queen steps up her attacks on the students of Ever After School, families are fleeing to the magical campus. Rory and her fellow warriors are worn out and worried. Making things worse, Chase has become flaky and unreliable just when Rory needs him most. He's so engrossed in a romantic relationship that he's letting down his friends. Rory wants his support as she prepares for her final battle, but instead she finds herself clashing with him s well.
","The action-packed finale to Shelby Bach's four-part Ever Afters series is the strongest in the fun fairy tale series, rich with emotional complexity and maturing relationships. The young teens in OF ENEMIES AND ENDINGS are grappling with the pull of first romances and changing relations with parents and mentors -- all while trying to save the world from a despotic sorceress. A puzzle drives the plot this time: Rory has an idea of what it will be like to face the Snow Queen, but she needs to figure out how to defeat her overwhelming power.

The Time Fetch,Kids must repair rip in the fabric of time in mild fantasy.,"Edward is about to be late for school and still doesn't have his glacial rock to bring to Mr. Ross' science class. On his way to the bus he runs through his Aunt Kit's garden and unearths something shaped like a rock, but it's not like anything formed by a glacier. It's a Time Fetch, with winged creatures that steal small bits of time sealed up inside it, waiting to be collected by a Keeper. As soon as Edward gets to school with his prize, things start to get a little strange. The late-December wind kicks up whenever his rock is visible, and classmates -- like that annoying loud-mouth Feenix; Danton, the class jock; and Brigit, a new girl who doesn't speak -- are strangely drawn to it. Feenix is so attracted to the Time Fetch that she runs off with it directly into Prospect Park. The other three follow but are turned around in a strange fit of forgetfulness: What were they doing there? Where were they going? That leaves Feenix in some serious trouble when she happens upon a certain gumdrop- and caramel-coated house filled with hags who know the Fetch's power and want some for themselves. But tapping into the stone has a serious cost, and may bring the whole fabric of time into a state of chaos or worse. And as they approach the winter solstice, Aunt Kit reminds Edward, more forces of chaos are set to be unleashed. Beware of the Unraveler.
","Clever touches in THE TIME FETCH make this light fantasy worth a read. The mythology of the Time Fetch itself is very intriguing. Aunt Kit and Mr. Ross are great adult characters, both lending real wisdom to the four main characters. Mr. Ross' tangent-prone lectures will make readers wish they could pull up a lab stool and hang out for a while. And it's fun to be kept guessing about how much Aunt Kit knows about what's to come -- the shopping list she gives Brigit is an ingenious little way to tie the last act of the story together.
	But just as time starts to unravel all around the young characters, some elements feel frayed as well. Edward, Feenix, Danton, and Brigit need a little more depth as characters; we don't even learn their age or what grade they're in. for starters. And it's hard to tell the story is about all four of them until too far into the book. Then there's the mythology of the Time Fetch that, after a great opener, gets left on the back burner. If you're already talking about the nature of time, readers can handle more complexity than the visual on the cover of flies gobbling it up. Where did they come from? Why? It keeps the story light and actiony, but a little more explanation would definitely be worth readers', ahem, time.","Parents need to know that The Time Fetch is a light fantasy in which four middle schoolers from different backgrounds come together to save the day. Readers will get a science and folklore lesson about the nature of time and the solstice as the main characters try to keep the world from turning to nothingness. One character is imprisoned and chased by hags, and three kids try not to watch as two panthers fight to the death (the only gory moment, and it's brief). There's a mention of Brigit's baby brother dying in his sleep and how the whole family is in mourning; Brigit stops talking after the event. Expect a handful of substitutes for swear words like ""twerpy bleepsters"" and some talk of drinking and naked sacrifice as a teacher explains Greek mythology regarding the solstice -- as close as you'll get to any real mature content in this light fantasy.

Upside Down in the Middle of Nowhere,Unflinching story of girl who survives Katrina.,"It's Friday, August 26, 2005, and Armani Curtis is turning 10 years old tomorrow. When her family hears news of Hurricane Katrina coming closer to New Orleans, Armani's only thought is that she hopes it doesn't mess up her birthday party. Armani has an especially close relationship with her grandmother, and her parents are kind and understanding of her excitement about her birthday, but even they can't deny the magnitude of the coming storm. As the storm grows bigger and almost immediately causes death and loss, Armani's birthday becomes a distant memory and she must focus only on the survival of her family. Several tragic events separate Armani from her parents, and she is left on her own with her two younger sisters depending on her to keep them safe. The three narrowly escape the chaos of the Superdome and are bused outside the city to a shelter where Armani must figure out whether or not to trust various grown-ups claiming they have Armani's best interests at heart.
","Armani's close-knit relationship with her family is the centerpiece here, nd it's what makes this story so powerful and relatable as Armani faces an extreme situation most kids won't experience. The day before the storm and her birthday, Armani's family is depicted as warm and loving but not perfect: Armani is easily annoyed by her four siblings and often feels jealous of the attention they get from her parents and her grandma. Her almost constant grouchiness with her brothers and sisters can be grating, but it makes it all the more meaningful when the storm comes and Armani realizes just how devastated she will be if she loses any of them. Though the writer's overuse of dialect in the dialogue can be distracting, the continuous action and the overwhelming enormity of the problems Armani is forced to solve will draw readers in.
Because this book is based on a real historical event, it's disappointing that there's no author's note explaining what is fact and what is fiction in Armani's story, but some readers may be inspired to research the real people and places affected by the storm. Given the recent media attention to the lack of diversity in children's books, it's disappointing there are no African-American faces on the cover and that the publisher instead chose to depict Armani's rain boots.","Parents need to know that Upside Down in the Middle of Nowhere is a unflinching look at the devastating repercussions of Hurricane Katrina on the Lower Ninth Ward, the mostly African-American community that was hit especially hard by the storm. The protagonist is a 10-year-old African-American girl named Armani, whose family loses their home, and she must make difficult decisions that affect her and her siblings' survival. The violence of nature is harsh and vivid, as when Armani and her siblings see a neighbor killed by a tree blowing down. Some of Armani's loved ones die, and she sees many horrible sights in the aftermath of the storm. Armani comes out of the experience as a stronger and kinder person, but her sorrow over her losses will take a long time to process. The characters speak in a strong local dialect, which may be off-putting or distracting for some readers. ",10,10,10,Julie T.

Mae Among the Stars,Simple bio of first African-American female astronaut.,"In MAE AMONG THE STARS, young Mae has a dream. She wants to see Earth from space. Her mom tells her she'll have to become an astronaut, says anything's possible if she believes it and works hard for it, and takes her to the library for books about space and astronauts. Both parents continue to encourage her, even when her teacher tries to redirect her career choice by saying, ""Nursing would be a good profession for someone like you."" Still, her parents encourage her, and when Mae finally gets to space, she ""waved to her mom and dad on Earth.""
","A biography of an African-American woman who triumphed in a STEM field is always welcome, though this picture book about astronaut Dr. Mae Jemison could have had a bit more substance. Mae Among the Stars focuses on Jemison's childhood, when ""Little Mae was a dreamer"" and got the idea that she wanted to see Earth from space. Her mom takes her to the library where she ""searched for books about space and astronauts,"" and Mae makes an ""astronaut costume out of old orange curtains and cardboard boxes."" These details help bring young Mae alive for the reader. When she asks her dad, ""But how do I become an astronaut?"" he answers, ""If you can dream it, believe in it, and work hard for it, anything is possible."" This refrain, strong on emotional encouragement but light on specifics, is repeated throughout by her supportive parents.
The art by Stasia Burrington is cute and appealing, though somewhat generic, making this portrait of a smart, determined, science-minded girl and her supportive family best for the very young.","Parents need to know that Mae Among the Stars by Roda Ahmed, illustrated by Stasia Burrington, is a picture book biography of Dr. Mae Jemison, the first African-American female astronaut. Since the book is spare, without much concrete information about her life or her path, it's best for the youngest kids, who'll come away with the simple and clear message that when she was young, Dr. Jemison had a dream of what she wanted to do, and her parents encouraged her, even when peers scoffed and her teacher tried to redirect her. A very short afterword gives a bit more information about Jemison's impressive scholarship and accomplishments.

"Truly Devious, Book 1","Clever murder mystery at truly hip, mature boarding school.","In TRULY DEVIOUS, Stevie is thrilled when she's admitted to Ellingham Academy in Vermont. Not only is Ellingham a prestigious and free boarding school, it's the home of one of the greatest murder mysteries of all time: that of rich entrepreneur Albert Ellingham's wife and daughter in 1936. It seems like a strange reason to be excited, but Stevie studies crime. She reads textbooks and mysteries and listens to true-crime podcasts and hopes one day to be a detective. As Stevie settles into her dorm at Ellingham and meets the other eccentric students there, her one-day dream becomes a reality too soon. A student is found dead. Everyone deems the tragedy an accident, but Stevie's not so sure.
","Like the author's Shades of London series, this trilogy start takes place in a hip boarding school that readers immediately  will want to attend, even if there's a murderer in their midst. It's that cool. There's a study yurt, snowshoes issued to everyone -- it's Vermont -- a mansion, secret tunnels everywhere, and the students have fascinating fields of study. There's an opera singer, a visual artist, a video game maker, a novelist, an inventor, and an actor/YouTube star, for starters. And there's Stevie, who studies crime nd wants to study everything about Ellingham Academy, where murders took place in the 1930s. The story jumps back and forth between 1936 and the present, cleverly piecing together brief stories and detective interviews from the past until a death of a student in the present pulls the reader into two complex cases at once. It also pulls the intellectually focused Stevie into an uncomfortable realization: She said she always wanted to see a dead body, and now she's facing the reality of it, with the shock and loss that goes with it. Her growth as a character adds depth to the story.
Readers will devour this mystery quickly and may be disappointed that so many loose ends remain. There's setup here that seems meant for other books in the series -- lots of time pawing through Albert Ellingham's desk tchotchkes and pondering the last riddle he wrote, for example -- making Truly Devious not stand alone as well as it could. But it does promise intriguing books to come.","Parents need to know that Truly Devious is the first book in a trilogy by the author of the Shades of London series. The story takes place at a school for gifted students in Vermont where a kidnapping and murder happened in the 1930s. In the present, a student is also found dead. The main character, Stevie, comes to the campus to study the old crime and ends up investigating the student's death as well. She realizes in the process how death really impacts people. This is a school setting for juniors and seniors. Students drink, one heavily; they swear in most conversations; straight and LGBTQ characters kiss; and there's talk of pot smoking. Social media is heavily used -- one student is a YouTube star.

Requiem,Gripping finale is good but leaves readers wanting more.,"Picking up a few days after the cliffhanger ending of Pandemonium, readers are thrown back into the story of protagonist Lena, her new love interest, Julian, and the newly resurrected Alex -- who (spoiler alert) didn't die as she believed for all of the second book. Unlike the other two books, author Lauren Oliver switches points of view between Lena and her former best friend Hana, who received the cure and is weeks away from marrying her assigned ""pair,"" the new mayor of Portland. As Lena deals with her unexpected love triangle, her resistance group of free ""Invalids"" heads north to her old hometown, where Hana is slowly uncovering ugly truths about her soon-to-be husband.
","Readers hoping for the same swoon factor as in the original book will be disappointed. This third book is more preoccupied with its young heroine’s personal journey in a horrific dystopian society than which guy she'll end up choosing. Even though Lena thinks about her feelings for Alex and Julian all the time, their reality is too grim and confusing (not to mention focused on fighting the regulators) to allow for the kind of thrilling romance that hooked some readers in Delirium.
Readers who don't mind the fact that the romance is present but not overwhelming will find themselves unable to put the book down, even though there are enough plot holes and unanswered questions to make the ending feel abrupt and unexpected. If you think there will be some magical epilogue spelling out everything that happens to these characters, think again. Oliver isn't one for easy answers or thorough explanations; it's the big themes about love, sacrifice, freedom, and choice that she wants readers to take away, not just the ""Lena and Alex"" storyline.
 ","Parents need to know that Requiem is the final installment in author Lauren Oliver's best-selling Delirium trilogy, a dystopian series that explores issues of love, societal control, gender relations, and politics. As in the second book, Pandemonium, the focus in this one is Lena's involvement in the resistance movement and how it fights the oppressive government. There's definitely violence (including character deaths, explosions, shootings, and hand-to-hand fights) and some stronng language (mostly ""s--t,"" the occasional expletive ""f--king"" never in reference to sex), but the romance is limited to a few kisses. This is the rare teen series in which the romance is most pronounced in the first book. Oliver discusses several themes that make for good conversation starters, from the Judgment of Solomon and Bluebeard to dystopian societies and arranged marriages.

Instead Butler is shot, and Spiro absconds with the C Cube, a supercomputer made with Fairy technology. Now Artemis must once again team up with the Fairy police to save Butler and retrieve the computer.
","The hallmarks of this popular series are action, suspense, and a humorous B-movie writing style, all of which are continued in this entry. Also present are the elements that trouble some parents -- a ruthless (though mellowing) child-criminal for a hero, and plenty of fantasy violence. Fans of the series will enjoy this one, even though they may find some of the plot convolutions confusing. If you haven't read the first two, don't try this one first -- aside from the complexity, it assumes knowledge of the earlier stories.
This may not be great literature, but given its chosen style, it's well-written -- and it's hard to imagine a summer reading book that's more fun.","Parents need to know that The Eternity Code is the third book in the popular Artemis Fowl series that includes a movie out in 2020 based on the first two books.

After much counting craziness and chaos, readers reach the end of the book finding ""0 monkeys"" to count -- until they turn the last page and find a horde of them on the endpapers.
","Count the Monkeys is a funny, clever picture book that plays with the traditional counting motif by making the story about never finding the animals intended to be counted.

This Song Will Save Your Life,Edgy story of bullied teen girl driven by music.,"Elise Dembowski is a smart teen with a passion for punk, indie, and classic rock. She's an outsider with her peers, who've ruthlessly tormented her throughout her school years. During the summer between her freshman and sophomore years of high school, Elise decides to change her personal style and reads up on pop culture, hoping to fit in better and connect with the other kids at her school. Her attempt fails miserably, causing Elise to hit rock bottom emotionally. A traumatic event pushes her even further to the social edges of her clique-ruled high school. To clear her mind, Elise starts taking long walks at night after her family has gone to bed. One such walk leads her to an underground nightclub, where she makes friends and is free of the daily torment of high school. Elise discovers that her love and knowledge of music, coupled with her skills at reading the behavior of groups, give her the perfect skills for becoming a club DJ.
","THIS SONG WILL SAVE YOUR LIFE has a relatable and engaging protagonist in Elise Dembowski. Her voice as a narrator is funny and honest, but the blithe delivery of her story belies the seriousness of the situations she encounters and the depth of her self-loathing. Author Leila Sales expertly captures the interior monologue of a teen girl, and Elise is well drawn as a bright introvert who has many ideas and feelings but few people to share them with. Her self-pitying, judgmental nature, and poor decisions grate, but perhaps that's the point: Teens can be infuriating. Most of Sales' other characters are one-dimensional.
Although much of the plot is fairly predictable, Sales keeps the story percolating. The book's ultimate message, that if you pursue what you love you'll find happiness, is a good one and is well delivered.","Parents need to know that This Song Will Save Your Life is a coming-of-age novel that deals with the heartbreak of being a lonely, ostracized, and bullied teen girl. Protagonist Elise Dembowski takes refuge in music and long late-night walks, both of which lead her to a new, exciting, secret life, transforming her view of herself and her relationship to the people in her life. The novel depicts underage drinking, smoking, sneaking out at night, lying to parents, bullying, and some violence. One character attempts suicide, which is described graphically. A man takes advantage of a drunk young woman but is discovered and chastised by another character before he can go too far. There's some strong language (""bitch,"" ""blow job,"" ""goddamn it,"" and ""s--tstorm""), and sex is sometimes discussed in graphic terms. There are descriptions of making out.

The Shadows of Ghadames,A girl's life in turn-of-the-century Muslim Libya.,"Malika lives in a town in Libya in the late nineteenth century. Women stay in the houses and on the rooftops, while men are free to walk the streets. As her brother goes out and begins working, and her merchant father sets out on another long trading journey, Malika feels increasingly imprisoned by her circumscribed life, in which she is not even permitted to learn to read and write, but knows she will be married off soon.
When her father's second wife rescues a wounded man being chased by a mob, she puts the whole family in danger. Hiding him in the house where there are women is strictly forbidden. But Malika is glad, because he begins teaching her how to read.
","In this somewhat uneven story, plot and character are strictly secondary to the author's two purposes: giving a portrait of Muslim female life, and disapproving of it. The vivid picture of that life is fascinating: the rooftop culture and travel routes, the painted gardens, the careful relations between the two wives of one man. The pictures of places and activities are far more compelling than the wan plot and washed out characters.
But the author puts into the minds and mouths of the characters ideas from Western culture that don't belong there: that women should have more freedom, that their lives are unfair, that their culture and religion are wrong-headed. At a time when building understanding between cultures is more important than ever, encouraging young readers to judge another culture by the standards of their own doesn't seem very helpful.","Parents need to know that this is a portrait of female life in turn-of-the-century Libya, so there's certainly much to discuss.

Will Archie get up to speed fast enough to become Dad's copilot for a day? And how will he ever explain this to the kids back home?
","This is an entertaining read because it has so much fun with its space-age premise, blending warm humor, silly twists, and spirited, likable characters.

A Stone for Sascha,Beautiful art in wordless tale of loss and passage of time.,"In A STONE FOR SASCHA, an African American family buries their dog, and the girl looks out to sea and pitches a stone into the water. The story then cuts back through history to prehistoric times when a fiery meteorite blazed through the sky and slammed to earth. The meteorite's later discovered by an early tribe of humans who wheel it away for worship, and after that is carted off by a band of shepherds. It’s carved into an obelisk, stolen by a warring culture, incorporated into a Buddha-like statue and the arch of a bridge, and when time ravages those, it's again discovered and carved into a smaller piece of art. That art's stolen by pirates, sinks in a storm, and is lost -- until years later a small piece of it washes up on the beach, and the girl places the stone on her dog's grave.
","This beautifully illustrated wordless story takes the long view about death and our place in the glacial passage of time and history. A Stone for Sascha might be best for the older end of the picture book crowd since it travels from prehistoric times through ancient cultures to the present, requiring some knowledge of history. And because it’s wordless, it calls on readers to interpret visual clues to the civilizations pictured. Though it's framed by a contemporary story about a girl mourning her dog, it's more a compelling meditation about time than it is about loss. Does the girl understand where she and her dog stand in the cosmos, and how they're connected to life that's passed before? When she presses the stone to her cheek, she appears to.
Aaron Becker's a stunning illustrator who threads the stories together in subtle ways. At the start, the girl and her father both wear necklaces with golden beads, as does one of the tribesmen in the first group of humans. When the meteorite first crashes to Earth, it embeds itself in the ocean floor, and, in a series of panels, works its way up and out as ocean becomes land, and dinosaurs give way to early mammals. Though some of the stone's passages are spurred by war and strife, and people clash with swords and arrows, there's a spiritual comfort to the slow passage of time.","Parents need to know that A Stone for Sascha is a wordless book by Aaron Becker, who won a Caldecott Honor for Journey, the first book in the wordless Journey trilogy. Because this book opens with the burial of a family dog, it deals with death and loss. It then careens back in time, picturing the dramatic arrival of a meteorite when the Earth was primordial sea soup, and follows the meteorite on its winding journey through evolutionary and human history to the present day. All of which lends a sense of connection and perspective to the loss, one that will be developmentally most meaningful to kids who are beginning to see themselves in relationship to the larger world. The family and girl protagonist are African American, and in the historical scenes with the meteorite, people of different races and cultures are pictured, including what appears to be Africans, Middle Easterners, Asians, and Europeans.

A Boy and a Jaguar,Inspiring true story of stutterer and his work with animals.,"As a child, Alan Rabinowitz suffered from severe stuttering and was put in ""a class for disturbed children,"" making him ""feel broken."" But he was comfortable speaking with animals nd felt they were similarly misunderstood: ""Animals can't get the words out, just as I can't. So people ignore or misunderstand or hurt them."" He promised his pets and a jaguar at the zoo that he'd grow up to ""be their voice and keep them from harm."" In college, he received treatment to help him speak fluently, formalized his study of animals, and eventually developed a specialization in wild cats and jaguars. True to his early promise to the animals, he persuaded officials in Belize to set up a jaguar preserve. The book ends with him in the wild sitting unharmed with a jaguar he'd protected.
","Author Alan Rabinowitz has written nonfiction for adults, and the writing in A BOY AND A JAGUAR is relatively straightforward, though there are artful passages. The story itself is moving and inspiring, providing a hopeful model for kids who struggle with a disability or who feel isolated and misunderstood.
The art by Catia Chien is evocative and illuminates the emotional heart of the book, the boy's feelings about being labeled and marginalized, as well as his connection with animals. The book makes a strong case for a human connection with and responsibility to wildlife.","Parents need to know that A Boy and a Jaguar is an autobiographical picture book by Alan Rabinowitz, a zoologist dedicated to protecting wild cat species, who also advocates for stutterers nd relates these two interests in his life story. As a child he was a severe stutterer, but he grew up to be an articulate and effective advocate for wildlife, particularly jaguars. Because the story spans his life, including references to college and work, it's probably most meaningful for older picture book readers, who can consider a life's trajectory. The book, illustrated by Catia Chien, won a prestigious award from the American Library Association --  2015 Schneider Family Book Award for artistic expression of the disability experience -- but its themes aren't restricted to stutterers. Many children will relate to the feelings of isolation and being misunderstood nd be inspired by Rabinowitz's work advocating for endangered animals.

","Engaging text and whimsical illustrations make this a great book to enjoy while learning some Spanish. Author Susan Middleton Elya beautifully exposes young readers to simple Spanish vocabulary, beautifully woven into the rhyming lines of this book. Ana Aranda's bright and festive illustrations in Our Celebración! are eye-catching and inviting, ready to delight young readers.

Sophie makes it while Kylie is designated team mascot, the mule. Their relationship is tested further when Sophie becomes part of the cheerleading popular clique. She tries to include Kylie but is frustrated and embarrassed by her friend's antics to get attention.

Sophie actually likes Kylie's neighbor, who also believes that Sophie has changed. Sophie has some soul-searching and explaining to do to get back her friends.
","One of the biggest errors in this book is the lack of diversity. Are these kids really any different? And parents, don't be fooled by the easy-to-read text -- there are many passages about dreamy boys, spending money on clothes, and experimenting with makeup that make this book not totally inappropriate for younger readers, but a much better fit for kids facing similar issues, readers 11+.","Parents need to know that this book in the Candy Apple series has at least a little more substance than the title implies. Geared for tweens, the plot focuses on social issues that are prevalent to this age range: fitting in, feeling awkward, first romantic attractions, relationships with parents, and balancing school and social pressures. It's an easy read, in fact probably manageable for most 8- and 9-year-olds. However, parents need to know that girls like boys and wear makeup, characters play truth or dare at a party and slow dance together, and the main character describes first romantic encounters.

Math for Smarty Pants,Solid lessons packaged as jokes and games.,"MATH FOR SMARTY PANTS promises a commonsense way of tackling basic math problems including logic, arithmetic, statistics, and geometry. This overview volume is jam-packed with kid-friendly activities that can be done using everyday objects such as cards, pennies, pencils, and notebooks, but a lackluster presentation diminishes its value.
 ","Full of useful exercises, MATH FOR SMARTY PANTS gamely takes on an almost impossible mission: endearing math to kids who fear it, hate it, or want nothing to do with it. It is not a skills text. It is jam-packed with solid math lessons packaged as tricks, jokes, and games, and it will be most useful to readers who will soon encounter these subjects in school or are already having a problem with them. Readers in either camp probably will need some adult help, encouragement, or insistence to work through the activities.
The book's dense design -- thick text blocks with dark ink illustrations -- results in a monotonous look that may bore already dubious readers. Despite its visual limitations, the book has other highlights. The ""Math Trickery"" chapter contains several activities kids can do on their own and should get a kick out of, using calculators to perform ""magic.""","Parents need to know that many activities will require adult assistance or prompting.

"There Will Come a Darkness: The Age of Darkness, Book 1",Mature fantasy with complex characters is full of surprises.,"In THERE WILL COME A DARKNESS, Ephyra and Beru are living in secret in the old prophetic city of Pallas Athos. Ephyra kills the wicked with her Grace of Blood and earns the nickname the Pale Hand because all she leaves on her victims' bodies is a ghostly hand print. The blood she gives to her sister Beru, who is sickly and needs the escha (life essence) to keep her heart beating. The city fears the Pale Hand and her power, almost as much as they fear the Witnesses. These are zealots who want to burn the Graced so there are none left in the world, even the ones who are gifted with special talents of healing and invention. The leader of the Witnesses already conquered the country of Nazirah and the crown prince, Hassan, barely escaped with his life. Hassan is also living in secret in Pallas Athos, but not for long. The Paladin Guard, an order of Graced fighters, is crossing the sea to find him and protect him. They've read the signs and think he's the last prophet, someone with the Grace of Sight who can show the way out of the darkness the last prophets predicted before they vanished from the world 100 years before.
","This promising fantasy series start features cool magical powers, an ensemble of complex, often haunted characters, and a dark prophecy that ties them all together. It will remind avid readers of Leigh Bardugo's Six of Crows duology, the way it shifts perspective every chapter and the way each character searches for their own redemption in an often wicked world. The best part about There Will Come a Darkness is all the surprises. No one is who you think and nothing ever goes even remotely according to plan. Which makes it rather funny that Jude, the assigned protector of the prophet, thinks he's strayed wildly from his mission when he's really the only one who hasn't.
Newbie author Katy Rose Pool is sure to garner a large following as the series continues, given the right marketing push. Here's hoping she can keep up the momentum and surprise readers many more times through the rest of the saga.","Parents need to know that There Will Come a Darkness is the first book in a fantasy trilogy for mature teens about prophets, kingdoms, magic, and possible end times. Things are dark enough that there's talk of a coming genocide and characters are tortured with waterboarding and burning. A teen character close to one of the main characters is murdered, and there are skirmishes with crossbows, swords, knives, and fists that lead to deaths and injuries. Expect some kissing, lots of innuendo, some swearing (mostly ""horses--t"") and heavy, fall-down drinking in taverns by an older teen. In this ensemble of major characters, both straight and LGBTQ, most change for the better. Prince Hassan makes a large mistake and decides that he will do everything to make up for it nd still be the leader his people need. Jude begins his journey with a lot of shame about his faults and discovers that they are an integral and vital part of him.

Percy Jackson's Greek Gods,Huge gift book of Percy-narrated Greek myths is tons of fun.,"After exploring how the Greeks thought the world began in a chapter entitled ""The Beginning and Stuff,"" the Titans appear, followed by the Olympians, who rage a battle royale for dominance. Then each of the 12 major Greek gods gets his or her own chapter. Percy refuses to start with Zeus, claiming he has a big enough ego already, so he goes with the order in which the gods were born. Each chapter includes full-color illustrations and Percy's take on each god's origins, what they're most known for, and stories of them interacting with mortals, looking for love, and smiting those who wronged them.
","PERCY JACKSON'S GREEK GODS is thorough, easy to read, and high on entertainment value. Readers get to enjoy Percy's sardonic and somewhat goofy voice, and, as with all Percy books, the humor in the chapter titles alone draws you in. ""Hermes Goes to Juvie"" and ""Ares, the Manly Man's Manly Man"" are two greats. The illustrations by John Rocco also are fabulous, especially the full-page ones in the gift-book size. This is not a book you get on iTunes or in paperback; spring for the hardcover. ","Parents need to know Percy Jackson's Greek Gods is a hefty gift-size volume that profiles the 12 major Greek gods, as narrated by Percy Jackson from the bestselling series. It helps a little to read the Percy Jackson books first. Then readers will instantly connect with the narrator. They'll know why Percy prefers some gods over others and will get his sometimes sardonic, sometimes goofy sense of humor. Percy's wit helps smooth things over when the content gets more mature. Gods can behave very badly; they swallow their own children (who pop out eventually as fully formed gods), tear mortals and other gods apart (such as when Zeus gets his tendons ripped out), torture those who wrong them with outrageous eternal punishments (for starters, poor Prometheus is chained to a rock while an eagle pecks at his liver every day), get mortals to go crazy and kill their own families, and stalk mortals they want to romance (there's one mention of a sexual assault). They also cheat on their godly spouses a lot. Percy covers their exploits with phrases such as ""get cuddly with"" and ""extremely naughty."" With the chapter on Bacchus, the wine god, comes a humorous disclaimer about how kids should wait until they're 40 before they drink -- they won't like the hangovers. Besides providing a thorough study of the Greek myths, there are plenty of educational tidbits sprinkled throughout about word origins, why ancient Greeks and Romans wore laurel wreaths on their heads, and much more.

He's sure if anyone sees him it won't go well, so he spends his life hiding in a storm drain with his imaginary friend, Candy Corn Carl. When he wants to see what's going on outside, he dons his disguise -- a banana peel on top of his head -- and sticks his head outside the drain. He thinks this makes him invisible. After years of this, he's feeling sad, discouraged, lonely, left out, and sure this is just the way things are, because after all, he's weird, right? And then he hears a voice from above. And it's not Candy Corn Carl. Things are about to change fast.
","Matthew Gray Gubler's whimsical illustrated tale of a monster trying to stay invisible because he's afraid people will think he's weird and be mean to him will resonate with kids and adults alike. Sweet, shy, lonely Rumple Buttercup gets sadder and sadder watching the world go by, and resorts to pathetically hilarious coping strategies like hiding under a banana peel. But when some people insist on befriending him anyhow, and everybody he meets points out something weird about themselves, it's a life-affirming and life-changing discovery for Rumple, and also for the reader.","Parents need to know that Rumple Buttercup is an appealing tale aimed at early readers, written and illustrated by Matthew Gray Gubler.

"I Love You, Beth Cooper","Witty, raunchy novel spiked with geeky humor.","Denis Cooverman, captain of the debate team and Star Wars light saber owner, declares his love for popular cheerleader Beth Cooper during his valedictorian speech in front of the entire graduating class. Unlike his fantasies, however, this does not lead to their marriage. Instead, he spends the night running from Beth's massive, violent boyfriend, who wants to kill him. Painfully. Along the way, with both their friends in tow, Denis discovers Beth is a tad more real -- and exciting -- than the angel he imagined.
","A homage to teen movies, I LOVE YOU, BETH COOPER manages to be both retro and contemporary, of-the-moment and timeless. It's also laugh-out-loud funny, with absurd bits that catch the reader by surprise. (The impossibility of Denis' love ""hung over his huge head like a sword of Damocles -- or to the non-honors graduates, like a sick fart."") Denis is socially clueless -- even his relationship with his maybe-gay best friend is awkward -- but readers will sympathize as they wince at his dweebishnes (he offers the boiling point of water when Beth makes small talk about the heat). Beth, far from an empty-headed cheerleader, works 35 hours a week and recognizes that high school may be as good as her life gets.
The final fourth of the book devolves into an increasingly unlikely (and less funny) mash of sex, alcohol, and violence, but by that point readers will just want to find out how Denis' wild night works out.","Parents need to know this funny novel features nonstop underage drinking, violence, sex (including oral sex and threesomes), and cursing.

Tips on Having a Gay (Ex) Boyfriend,Mature themes abound in tale about a teen's gay ex.,"After Belle finds out that her high school sweetheart is gay, she has to move on with her life, trying to deal with his new boyfriend, the small town gossip, her own new love interest -- and an intimidating bully who now seems fixated on her.
","The writer definitely has talent. She describes the cold Maine setting beautifully, using the icy, barren backdrop to emphasize the loneliness Belle feels after losing her boyfriend. She also shares wonderful details -- such as Belle and Dylan's trips to a small cemetery, where they imagine the lives of those buried there -- which give her characters some depth.
 The problem is that she tries to pack too much into this novel: a gay boyfriend, their intolerant small town, his new relationship, her new relationship, a bully who begins targeting Belle -- and, oh yeah, there's also Belle's epilepsy. Hopefully, this author will continue to write, sharpening her storytelling skills to match her talent for detail.","Parents need to know that this book centers on a teen girl whose boyfriend tells her he's gay. She recalls having sex with him and eventually kisses a new guy; her ex-boyfriend goes on to have a relationship with another boy. There is swearing, including derogatory terms for gay people.

A boat awaits him nd takes him to meet the young boy and king who've been her fellow adventurers. But when the king is captured by the villains, the girl and father together use the crayon to draw a submarine that takes them to an underground cave with ancient cave paintings that recount the past stories and point the way to the story's solution. Girl and dad draw a trap for the villains, freeing them to return to their city life where they at last fly her red kite.
","Art and imagination can transport us, and so can this beautiful picture book, third in a wordless trilogy that takes its heroine on a magical adventure and carries the reader along for the ride. A girl and her friends create their own adventures with crayons, and the world they imagine is beautiful but dangerous, so they draw their way out of harm by creating a griffin and a submarine to help them escape their pursuers.

"Legends, Icons & Rebels: Music That Changed the World",Wonderful intro to 27 musicians and their unique styles.,"LEGENDS, ICONS & REBELS: MUSIC THAT CHANGED THE WORLD offers short biographical sketches of 27 influential music pioneers of rock, soul/R&B, country, jazz, pop, and reggae. The artists range from superstars with whom kids may be familiar -- The Beatles, Elvis Presley, Stevie Wonder, Bob Marley, and the Beach Boys -- to less well-known figures such as Curtis Mayfield, Joni Mitchell, Hank Williams, and Ella Fitzgerald. Many profiles include anecdotes about the musicians' lives growing up and the times in which they lived; each one is accompanied by an imaginative portrait by a different contributing artist. Two CDs included in the hardcover version feature a song by each musician.
","Legends, Icons & Rebels is a wonderful introduction to more than two dozen pioneering singers and groups who helped shape modern popular music. The book covers a tremendous range of styles and eras: seminal jazz artists (Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong); early R&B greats (Ray Charles, Louis Jordan); first-gen rock 'n' rollers (Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, Little Richard); a few country legends (Hank Williams, Patsy Cline, Johnny Cash); pop crooners (Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole); influential soul sensations (Aretha Franklin, Curtis Mayfield, Sam Cooke, James Brown, Otis Redding, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder); two superstar 1960s groups (the Beatles and the Beach Boys); singer-songwriters (Bob Dylan, Carole King, Joni Mitchell); and the undisputed king of reggae (Bob Marley). Each enthusiastic, two-page, large-type bio has interesting anecdotes, facts, and analysis of what's special about the artist, plus a five-song playlist of recommended listening.
The writing is clear, concise, and well researched. The typography is sometimes jarring, with certain phrases emphasized in larger (and LARGER) type to bring home a point, but it makes for visually stimulating reading. Co-author Robbie Robertson, famous for leading the popular '60s/early '70s group The Band, offers brief personal remarks about each musician. The only quibble is the seemingly random order of the profiles. Had they been arranged chronologically or by genre, developments in the different styles would be more coherent.","Parents need to know that Legends, Icons & Rebels: Music That Changed the World is a large-format nonfiction book featuring short biographies of 27 pioneering musicians/singers from the 1920s to the present who represent a multitude of music styles, from rock 'n' roll to jazz to rhythm and blues and more. There are frank but unsensational mentions of drug and alcohol abuse by a number of these musicians as well as some sociopolitical content, as many of them were affected by racism, opposed the Vietnam War, or rebelled against other aspects of mainstream American society. The emphasis, however, is on what made each artist's music special and historically important. Two CDs included in the hardcover version give kids a chance to hear a classic track from each artist.

","Silliness abounds when a determined young girl decides to take her piano to the beach despite her mother's warning, ""You'd better not lose it,"" and though it's hard to lose a piano, lose it she does. Kids will laugh at the absurdity in the text and the very funny art and at Magnolia's faces, which are wildly expressive. Magnolia is the epitome of a single-minded, can-do girl who's not daunted by the challenges of piano moving.
Magnolia narrates the book as instruction to ""you"" the reader, a form that will be familiar to readers of any of the If You Give a Mouse a Cookie books. As in those, the story circles back to the way it began, providing a satisfying ending. The beach setting adds to the fun in this breezy summer read.","Parents need to know that Elise Parsley's If You Ever Want to Bring a Piano to the Beach, Don't!, a sequel to her popular If You Ever Want to Bring an Alligator to School, Don't!, features the same demonically determined narrator, Magnolia, and revels in the same slaphappy silliness. Magnolia, the oldest of three siblings, decides to bring her piano on a family trip to the beach, with predictably ridiculous results -- the piano ends up sodden and floating out to sea. Kids will enjoy being in on the preposterousness, and Magnolia is a refreshingly strong-willed female character. The art pictures a comfortably inclusive family, with siblings of different races.

"The Crown: The Selection, Book 5",Fantasy-romance installment ramps up the palace intrigue.,"A family crisis means that Princess Eadlyn suddenly has to take on the burden of THE CROWN ll on her own. But she's also right in the midst of choosing her future husband in a televised contest called a Selection. To keep the Selection manageable, she overnight whittles the 35 contestants down to six Elite finalists. Each of the Elite has something unique to offer and would make a good husband, but Eadlyn doesn't feel a real spark with any of them. To keep her country and her family from falling apart at the seams, she'll have to learn whom she can trust, how to handle betrayal, and the real value of true love.
","Fans of Kiera Cass' Selection series will be happy with the payoff that comes in this fifth installment, which picks up right where The Heir left off. In many ways, the circle begun with the first book is closing, and romance-fantasy fans will enjoy rooting for Eadlyn as she assumes her place in history. Intrigue and the problems of governing are more at the forefront of this installment, although there are still plenty of dashing young men hoping to be the next prince consort. Eadlyn's interactions with them take a back seat to the burdens of governing, but fans will still sigh along as Eadlyn finds her true love and faces an impossible choice.
Readers new to the series may be baffled by the absence of any background about the world the story inhabits and by the large cast of characters -- wait, who is Josie again? But fans of the series will enjoy picking up where they left off and the fact that there's plenty of room for more romance and intrigue in Eadlyn's future.","Parents need to know that The Crown is the fifth installment in the Selection series by Kiera Cass. It picks up right where The Heir left off, and even though reading the previous books isn't strictly necessary to enjoy this fantasy romance, it will be easier to follow and more deeply enjoyed by fans of the series. There's no violence other than mention of past rebellion and current unrest. Sexual content is very mild, with a few kisses not described in detail. ""Ass"" and ""damn"" appear once each. Eadlyn is a good role model, always treating others well, thinking creatively, keeping her country's best interests above herself, and finding the courage to trust her heart.

The Outcast: Summoner Trilogy Prequel,Action-packed origin story for Fletcher's mentor Arcturus.,"In THE OUTCAST: SUMMONER TRILOGY PREQUEL, Arcturus is an orphan running away from his tavern job where he's regularly beaten. First, he stops by the stables to steal a horse for his journey. That's when he discovers a summoning scroll left in a saddle bag, reads it aloud, and accidentally summons a large canid demon that will be his for life. His transgression is found out immediately, and he's imprisoned and questioned. Commoners are not supposed to have the ability to summon nd are not welcome within the ranks of the noble children who train at Vocans Academy. On the king's orders, he's sent to the school anyway. Arcturus sleeps in the ""punishment room"" at night and every day at school feels like he's being punished by the students who consider him an outcast. The night he decides to run away, two of the students have a nasty surprise for him: They summon a giant demon from the ether to kill him and intend to make it look like an accident.
","Fletcher's mentor Arcturus from the Summoner trilogy gets his origin story in this prequel, which focuses heavily on action. Arcturus and friends are on the run for the last two thirds of The Outcast, in fact. He mentions often how tired he is -- the reader will be, too. It's a little too much of a good thing, even for fantasy fans who crave high adventure stories. You almost lose count of how many times Arcturus nearly dies. Magical healing has its downsides in the world of effective storytelling, where one climactic action sequence is plenty.
That's not to say author Taran Matharu turns The Outcast into a one-note video game. He often points back to the deeper themes from the main trilogy on racial and class injustice. They continue to hold poignancy here. And his main character, Arcturus, may be forced into some bloody moments, but he never thinks it's OK to kill. More on Arcturus' inner transition from commoner to brave summoner would have been welcome.","Parents need to know that Taran Matharu's The Outcast is a prequel in the Summoner series featuring a world of demons, humans, orcs, and dwarfs. As in the main series, there's much tension between the races and classes. The main character, Arcturus, is nearly murdered just for being a commoner and orphan who can summon demons. His ability makes the nobles feel threatened. That's not the only time Arcturus almost dies. There's plenty of dangerous action here. Arcturus and friends are pursued by orcs, soldiers, and rebels nd attacked with crossbows, swords, and demons. Some gore is described: An orc's neck is ripped open, another is decapitated, a man is tortured. When Arcturus is forced to kill to save himself, he's distraught and understands the seriousness of what he's done. Expect consistent swearing in the dialogue, mostly ""damned"" and never anything worse than ""bastards.""

The 39 Clues Series,"Exciting mystery, heavily merchandised.","Orphans Amy and Dan belong to a rich and powerful family related to nearly everyone important in history. When their grandmother dies, she leaves 39 clues, spread across the planet, to a treasure that will make the finder immensely powerful. So all the relatives, none of them decent or honest (except Amy and Dan, of course), compete to find and solve the clues while trying to eliminate their competition. This proposed 10-book series (10 physical books followed by 29 online-only installments), each by a different author, includes cards plus a code for a Web site with an online game with cash prizes.
","Taken simply as a story, this first book is pretty good. Sure, you have to park your disbelief at the door and give up on any expectation of realism. That done, it's loads of fun, with action, mysteries, and clues. It's clearly intended to make money, and a little more baldly than most. But as long as the writing is good and the story is fun, who cares? And Rick Riordan, author of the Percy Jackson series, knows how to pace a story.
The second installment keeps moving like the first -- from Vienna to Salzburg to Venice this time. And it keeps you guessing about how the clues will fit together. But the brother-sister team seems less likable here. Dan won't stop whining about how boring he thinks Mozart is and the two won't stock bickering. It overshadows their talents and makes you wonder how they're able to stay ahead of the competition.
The third installment sends the Cahills to Japan and Korea and teams up Amy and Dan with ruthless relatives Ian and Natalie Kabra. The book starts and ends with fun flourishes and twists but it also gets to the heart of what the four Cahill branches are really fighting over -- and it's not all that original. Also, the puzzles leading to the clues are confusing and the romantic subplot feels clumsily put together.
Dan and Amy Cahill work their way through Egypt in the fourth installment. Lucky for them their grandma has left numerous hints around Cairo and the tombs. Once again this installment doesn't hold a candle to the first in the series. There's no logical flow from one clue to the next and the way the kids figure out some of the puzzles makes no sense. It's too bad because Egypt is such an exciting place for a treasure hunt.","Parents need to know that nearly everyone in the first book is trying to kill, sideline, or deceive the heroes, who are orphaned children. There is some violence (arson, explosions, traps, and several fights with injuries) though it's mostly cartoonish. This book includes incentives to purchase cards, register on a website, and sign up for a contest with cash prizes. It's also a popular mobile app with buzz that it's being made into a movie with Steven Spielberg attached.

Zen and the Art of Faking It,Great wisdom and humor for teens to meditate on.,"Eighth grader San Lee moves to Pennsylvania with his mother and starts yet another new school. His father is serving time for some cons performed across the country, dragging the family along each time. Being the new kid, San is trying to figure out who to pretend to be to fit in with his peers. He impresses his teacher and classmates with his answers on Zen so he becomes San, the Zen kid at school. He sits on a rock meditating before school, wears socks with sandals in winter, and professes not to need any \""earthly attachments.\""
Except he has a big crush on a female classmate. They work on a project together, share details about their lives (his are all lies), but he thinks the attraction is largely based on him being an expert on Zen. They volunteer together at a soup kitchen and teach the B level school basketball team how to use Zen in the game. San's new life is going well, but of course eventually his lies will have to catch up with him.
","Teen readers will relate to San's attitudes toward his classmates -- bullies, girls, jocks -- and his awkwardness around other kids. But the author missed an opportunity to talk more about racial attitudes and stereotypes; it's all handled too subtly. Ultimately San teaches readers what happens when lies are revealed, that is, about the importance of character and humility.
Who wants to stand out in the middle school years? Certainly not San Lee, the main character in ZEN AND THE ART OF FAKING IT. There's so much going on in San's head that his insight into his world -- though it seems unrealistically developed for his age -- is a real treat for the reader. His crush on a female classmate is full of authentic details, he relates his anger toward his father to his constant lying to classmates, and his self-deprecating humor and sarcasm are spot-on funny.","Parents need to know that this book is a sure hit with both male and female middle school readers. The dialogue keeps the tone light while the book touches on heavy themes, including lying by the main character (for starters, he's adopted from China and tells peers his whole family is Chinese), a con-artist abusive father in jail, a mother and son struggling financially, another mother deserting her daughter and husband, and a bully punching the main character. There's some mild wishful romance, and at the end there is a lesson about facing the truth.

Ice Island,Tense adventure as dogsled run becomes race for survival.,"Thirteen-year-old Tatum is obsessed with sled-dog racing and dreams of being in the Iditarod, so she's thrilled when her mom gets a temporary job at a remote Alaskan resort and takes Tatum along. Before long she's befriended a local boy who shares her interest, and when they're caught in a storm during what's supposed to be a short afternoon run, they and their dogs must call on all their resources to survive.
","Author Shahan is primarily a travel writer, and she passionately describes the treacherously beautiful, blinding white landscape that is home to sled dogs and the people who love them. ICE ISLAND captures the precariousness of life on the frontier, the ease with which everything can change in an instant, and the way your very survival and that of your loved ones depends on how well you respond. The novel also conveys a lot of common sense and good values, including the ability to solve the problems that result from having made the wrong decision earlier.","Parents need to know that Ice Island is a fast-paced, exciting story of 13-year-old Tatum, her friend Cole, and their sled dogs -- stranded on their own in the wilds of Alaska after an unexpected storm. They must all use a lot of judgment, courage, and resourcefulness as they face much physical danger, from getting caught in avalanches to falling through thin ice that's covered by a deceptive blanket of snow. There is frequent, matter-of-fact discussion of dog ""pee"" and dog and other animal excrement in contexts appropriate to the story, along with the occasional witticism about avoiding yellow snow. In one scene the dogs kill a caribou and eat the meat to survive.

The Boy Who Became Buffalo Bill: Growing Up Billy Cody in Bleeding Kansas,Captivating biography of legendary showman Buffalo Bill.,"In the late 19th nd early 20th centuries, William ""Buffalo Bill"" Cody was as famous as a 21st-century movie superstar. His Wild West Show and Congress of Rough Riders of the World (at its peak, it required 500 train cars to transport 100 entertainers and hundreds of horses and featured Annie Oakley and the great Lakota Sioux Chief Sitting Bull) performed all over the world. As extraordinary as his adult life came to be, his childhood years were equally the stuff of legend. Raised in Kansas during the violent struggle between pro-slavers and abolitionists, Cody was herding cattle behind a wagon train at age 11 and working as a fur trapper at 13 before, t 14, he signed on to the dangerous life of a Pony Express rider. Before joining the Union Army, he became part of a guerrilla band that crossed the border to slave-holding Missouri to steal horses. After serving in the Union Army as a scout and spy, Cody became a legendary buffalo hunter (earning him the nickname Buffalo Bill) and a guide for General Custer’s troops. In 1883, he created the first of the Wild West shows that would make him an international celebrity for the rest of his life.
","Filled with cowboys, wagon trains, cattle drives, Indians, Civil War spies, and European royalty, this riveting biography of Buffalo Bill has enough adventure for a Hollywood movie. Author Andrea Warren's liberal use of archival photos and illustrations bring a sense of time and place to the text and helps make the often-dreaded ""history lesson"" come alive. THE BOY WHO BECAME BUFFALO BILL presents the complex issue of slave and free states in a way that's understandable even for readers who might not yet have studied the subject.
Warren addresses but never discusses in depth two striking dualities in Cody's life: He earned his nickname by killing thousands of buffalo to feed workers on the railways going west, but he also was a conservationist. He fought and killed Indians while he was an Army scout and felt that they should cede their land to white settlers, but he was an open critic of their treatment by the U.S. government and honored them as respected members of his Wild West Show. This book will show readers that biographies can be even more exciting than fiction.","Parents need to know that Andrea Warren's The Boy Who Became Buffalo Bill: Growing Up Billy Cody in Bleeding Kansas, is a biography of William Cody, the founder and star of the world famous Wild West Show. Warren's biography concentrates largely on Cody's years growing up in the Kansas Territory, which t the time was known as ""Bloody Kansas"" because of the violence between pro-slavers and abolitionists. Before he was 17, Cody had worked on wagon trains, ridden for the Pony Express, prospected for gold, been an Army scout on the Santa Fe Trail, and joined the Union Army. Despite a backdrop of some of the most violent times in American history, that violence is never described in graphic detail.

Impulse,Gritty book about suicide survivors told in free verse.,"Three teens are locked up in a psychiatric facility after their suicide attempts. They each have a dark past filled with abuse, but slowly they begin to open up to one another and form tight bonds.
","More than 600 free-verse pages about teen suicide gets to be a bit much at times, especially as the three interconnected protagonists reveal all the trauma they've endured in their short lives. And that includes everything from sexual abuse to abortion to cutting and more. But by stringing together short lines, Hopkins is able to make each of her characters real and distinct. Along the way, readers will find themselves really caring for Vanessa, Conner, and especially warm and funny Tony, as the troubled teens start to deal with their demons, and depend on one another.
In the end, IMPULSE is a gritty and realistic book for mature teens only. It can open the door to a lot of conversations, thanks to the myriad topics it covers. Parents who do a quick flip through the book first will feel more prepared for the discussion.","Parents need to know that each of the main characters has tried to commit suicide, and each has suffered abuse (sexual, emotional, and physical). There is lots of gritty language and plotting: One character murdered his abuser as a child, another had sex with a teacher, and the third watched her mentally ill mother die. Plus, there's cutting, abortion, bi-polar disorder, over-achieving, and a character who thinks he's gay. In the end, one of the protagonists dies a rather violent death. Since the free verse makes this a quicker read, it'll make it easier for parents to preview the content ahead of their mature teens.

Sugar Plum Ballerinas,Important lessons on staying true to friends and yourself.,"Alexandra is not happy when her eccentric, costume-designing mom decides to move from Georgia to Harlem. She is also not happy that she is being forced to take ballet when what she really wants is to strap on her ice skates to practice speed skating. Moving to a New York City apartment is bad enough, but taking classes at the Nutcracker School is horrible. Not only does her mother push her to wear outlandish outfits but, when it comes to technique, she feels very much out of her league. When, by chance, she is given the most cherished solo role in the upcoming recital, she nearly cracks. Luckily, the new friends she makes pull her through.
","Rather than being a simple story full of girls who envy one another for looks, talent, or any other superficial quality, this is a story with lessons, many of them. And all of them point back to the basic premise that the girl who stays true to herself and her dreams, the girl who values and helps her friends, is a girl who will succeed. Shallow, mean girls, even those with talent and money, are not the heroes here. Instead, in addition to Alexandra, the main character, the heroic girls are true individuals. One is a Puerto Rican-Italian who tie-dyes her leotards to cover food spills and stains. Another is an young African-American with crooked teeth but a huge dancing talent, yet another is a girl so interested in science that she tries to talk backwards like Leonardo da Vinci in order to expand her genius. And there are others.
This is also the story of Alexandra and her mother and how they learn to appreciate each other for the dreams they have. The narrative itself is simple, but the conflicts are as complex as those kids face in the real world. Surprisingly, this is a pretty good book, one to which girls especially will relate, even if they are not interested in dancing, tutus, or all that goes along with the frilly, girly world.","Parents need to know that the lessons in this book, especially those about being an individual, are good ones, even for kids not interested in ballet. One girl always tries to talk in backward sentences, which might need to be explained to younger readers.

"Al Capone Throws Me a Curve: A Tale from Alcatraz, Book 4","Riveting prison drama returns with focus on family, freedom.","All Moose Flanagan really wants in AL CAPONE THROWS ME A CURVE is to secure a spot on the high school baseball team. But the captain refuses to give a freshman a chance -- unless Moose can bring him impossible proof that he knows Al Capone, the most famous inmate on Alcatraz Island, where Moose lives with his family because his father works there. Meanwhile, the warden saddles Moose with keeping tabs on his untrustworthy daughter, and a prisoner strike has everyone on edge. To top it all off, Moose feels as if he's the only one trying to keep his older sister, Natalie, who's on the autism spectrum, from people who might take advantage of her. It all comes to a head with the most high-stakes game of baseball Moose has ever played.
","Gennifer Choldenko makes great use of one of the world's most notorious prisons as an enticing hook for her popular A Tale from Alcatraz series, but the real drama is focused on family and growing up. In Al Capone Throws Me a Curve, Moose chafes at having so much responsibility, but he appreciates how much he's needed: He fills in for an unreliable parent to care for his sister, steps up to handle convicts' chores when they strike, and takes initiative to help his family when someone sets them up for disaster.
Moose's sister with autism remains key to the plot: As Natalie turns 17, her behavior forces her family to stop treating her like a little girl and think more about her future. She's a strong character, and Moose treats her with respect and love. His empathy is the beating heart of this series, from his love for Natalie to his concern for an at-risk inmate and his beloved cat. Growing up can be hard, but here Moose learns that standing up for himself doesn't mean he's on his own.","Parents need to know that Al Capone Throws Me a Curve -- the fourth book in Gennifer Choldenko's A Tale from Alcatraz series -- centers on how Moose Flanagan's family handles the maturation of his sister, Natalie, who's on the autism spectrum. Her interest in wearing flattering dresses and her infatuation with a teen boy cause embarrassment and concern for Moose, and she ends up in a perilous situation that puts her in danger of sexual assault. The worry over sexual violence and undesirable attention is an essential thread in the plot but isn't discussed explicitly: Moose frets over her exposure to the ""abominably wicked men"" in the prison, and there's a close encounter with an armed, threatening inmate. Children handle a weapon without permission and face perilous situations. One adult is overwhelmed and struggles to be a fully engaged parent, and another intentionally exposes a child to danger to try to gain advantage for her own family.

The Old Man and the Sea,"Man vs. marlin story a challenging, introspective read.","After 84 days of catching nothing, Santiago, an old Cuban fisherman, sets out alone in his small skiff into the Gulf Stream in search of better fortune and soon hooks what proves to be the fish of a lifetime. As he spends the next three days on the high seas being towed by the colossal marlin, sleeping and waking, he ponders his strategy, struggles with the mighty fish, and reflects on his life.
","Not everyone, especially among the young, is prepared to engage with a plot that's largely waiting and introspection, punctuated by description and reminiscence, however beautifully written. Generations of critics and readers have showered this book with praise; generations of other readers, particularly those required to read it in school, have blasted it as the worst book they ever read, when they admit to getting through it at all, despite its brevity. Whether the particular class for which your kid is reading the book intends to focus on Hemingway, symbolism, heroic struggle, marine life, pre-Castro Cuba, or baseball in the Eisenhower era, it might be helpful to get a few bearings before sending him or her out on the high seas in this book.","Parents need to know that context and the teacher's skill will influence how well their kids relate to this reading-list staple. Widely regarded as Hemingway's masterpiece, it won the Pulitzer Prize and had much to do with his winning the Nobel. It's packed with epic struggles (man vs. nature, man vs. himself), eternal issues (love, survival, teaching the next generation, tenacity against the odds) and strong writing. It's also about three days in a boat in which most of the action takes place in the title character's head, punctuated by graphic descriptions of, say, the gutting of fish. It's also somewhat fraught with a late-in-life perspective that may be largely lost on young readers. Readers young and old are rarely ambivalent about this book -- it's either love or hate, often mixed with a hefty dose of parody (Hemingway at times writes like a macho parody of himself). To nudge kids in the love direction, you may wish to check out Alexander Petrov's 1999 Oscar-winning animated film adaptation.

"The Tyrant's Tomb: The Trials of Apollo, Book 4",Apollo atones as the exciting mythological mayhem continues.,"In THE TYRANT'S TOMB: THE TRIALS OF APOLLO, BOOK 4, Meg and Apollo have the sad and necessary task of taking Jason's body back to New Rome in the San Francisco Bay Area. The hearse almost makes it to the Caldecott Tunnel when it's attacked by eurynomoi, giant underworld vultures. Sentries from New Rome come running, but can't stop Apollo from getting scratched. A eurynomous scratch will turn its victim into a vrykolakas (zombie) in a matter of days -- which is about how much time Apollo, Meg, and all of New Rome have before Caligula and Commodus show up in the San Francisco Bay with their fleet of weaponized yachts. To save New Rome and his mortal form, Apollo will need both the Sybil prophesies that a harpy is frantically tattooing onto a cyclops (that's right) and some serious divine Roman intervention.
","This Apollo series stays exciting with loads of mythological mayhem, but also gets heavy with sad departures and some serious comeuppance for a now-mortal god growing a conscience. Luckily, nothing ever gets heavy for too long, not when the best weapons are sometimes horrid Dean Martin songs and the best way for a harpy to remember a prophesy is to tattoo it on her cyclops-boyfriend's body. There's a delight just in the sheer randomness of author Rick Riordan's imagination.
So many characters and mythological creatures and side quests swirl about in the story that sometimes it's hard for the reader to piece it all together. (Like why's the guy in the tomb in cahoots with the other emperors, and why on earth would you want to pay him a visit?) Plus we're back in Roman territory with Roman terms, rules, and characters. It takes some time to get all the wheels in motion because there are more wheels than The Tyrant's Tomb needs, but most everything rolls neatly to the end -- well, at least the end before the real ending in Book 5.","Parents need to know that The Tyrant's Tomb is the fourth book in a series that's a spin-off of a Percy Jackson spin-off series. The Percy Jackson and the Olympians series came first, then the Heroes of Olympus. It helps to read them both before digging into the Trials of Apollo series. The storyline picks up after the war at the end of the Heroes of Olympus, and many old favorite characters make cameos or are mentioned, like Frank, Hazel, and Reyna. And, for extra credit, reading the Apollo chapter in Percy Jackson's Greek Gods helps when our ""suddenly mortal and very unhappy about it"" narrator, Apollo, recounts key moments of his godly life. A lot is thrown at readers in the way of ancient history, Roman terms, and Greek and Roman characters, so thank goodness for the 16-page glossary at the end of the book. After the death of a beloved character at the end of Book 3, The Burning Maze, there's more bloodshed to come in The Tyrant's Tomb. Expect a huge climactic battle with all kinds of mythical creatures (including lots of undead warriors), more casualties and injuries, and a little bit of gore (a stabbing in the eye, a horrible burn wound that eventually kills). Plus, there's not one but two car crashes off cliffs, with one broken leg. We learn more about Apollo's bad behavior when he was a god, including having a girlfriend killed and bullying a minor god. Facing his past, he feels shame and regret (mortal emotions new to him), is nearly killed, and is willing to sacrifice everything for his friends.

Fairy Tale,Occasionally amusing but flat supernatural romance.,"Morgan and her boyfriend Cam have been joined at the hip since they were very small. But as they approach their mutual sixteenth birthday, Cam begins to change. It turns out he's actually a fairy changeling, and on his birthday he will have to switch places with the human boy he was exchanged with -- Pip -- and take up his rightful role as heir to the throne of the fairy world. But Morgan can't imagine life without him, and conspires with Pip to keep Cam in our world.
","This has a few things going for it: an amusingly sardonic narrator, a few interesting tweaks of the formula, and a writing style that keeps the pages turning even when there's little happening. The supernatural teen romance, a genre that barely existed for young adults just a few years ago, is now hugely popular, as authors and publishers hope to produce the next Twilight. The same phenomenon happened a few years earlier, and continues today, with Harry Potter and the fantasy genre. 	But there's not much involvement here. The characters are rather flat and superficial, the emotions distant, the ending all-too predictable. As Morgan's self-centeredness becomes increasingly dangerous to both Cam and Pip, readers may grow impatient for her to reach the obvious conclusion. There's not much chemistry between Morgan and Cam beyond her frequent professions of love (that mostly amount to her not being able to imagine what she'll do without him in her life, a dubious model of love). She and Pip have a bit more, but it's spoiled by her frequent observations of how hunky he's becoming. A pleasantly entertaining novel that won't stick in the mind much past the final page.

It all started way before that, though, in junior high, when I correctly guessed who would win the million-dollar prize on every reality-TV show out there. At times I would have to think, really think, to know the answer, but sometimes I would just wake up and, clear as day, the face of the winner would pop into my mind. Soon, I started testing my abilities out on my friends, and my friends' friends, and before long, every other person at school wanted my services. Seriously, being a psychic will do more for your reputation than a driver's license or a head-to-toe Marc Jacobs wardrobe.
	Sierra tosses her frizzed-out, corn-husk-blond spirals over her shoulder and straightens. ""Well, maybe you saw someone else. Someone who looked like me. Isn't that possible?""
	Actually, it isn't possible at all. Sierra has a totally warped sense of style, like Andy Warhol on crack. Everyday things lying around the house do not always make attractive accessories. I shrug, though, since I don't feel like explaining that hell would have a ski resort before two people on the face of this earth would think it was okay to tie their ponytail up in a Twizzler, and crane my neck toward the refreshment stand. I'm starving. Where are my French fries?","Parents need to know that the author seems unable to mention an object, food, or place without attaching a brand name to it, which, of course, will date this book very quickly.

Leon and the Spitting Image,Every kid's fantasy -- controlling the teacher.,"Leon has difficulties with fine-motor coordination, which becomes a problem when his strange and maniacal fourth-grade teacher, Miss Hagmeyer, announces that each student will have to complete a series of increasingly difficult sewing assignments before going on to fifth grade. He also has problems with the class bully, Lumpkin, and an ice machine that keeps him up all night.
For his final project, Leon makes a doll that is the spitting image of Miss Hagmeyer. But when Lumpkin pours some of the coach's chewing tobacco spit on it, Leon discovers that he can control Miss Hagmeyer's actions with the doll. Suddenly life is full of interesting possibilities.
","This lightweight fantasy, with some mildly disgusting imagery, will keep middle-graders amused without horrifying their parents too much. The wish-fulfillment idea of controlling a mean teacher has real appeal, and the not-very-surprising ending, in which it turns out that the magic can't hurt anyone and that the teacher is not as mean as she seems, mitigates any edge the story may have seemed to have.
First-time children's author Allen Kurzweil is not taking any chances here, and there's a certain by-the-numbers quality to the care he invests in appealing to childish humor without bothering adults. The result is harmless and modestly entertaining, which seems to be what he was going for.","Parents need to know that this is a lightweight, fun read.

The True Meaning of Cleavage,"Despite risque cover, this is about friendship.","Jess, an artist and sci-fi fan, and her one friend, Sari, start their freshman year in high school. Jess, the narrator, is ordinary and insecure; Sari is \""hot\"" and doesn't care what people think about her. \""Basically, it was inevitable that we became best friends. We are essentially the only normal people in our entire school, the only girls who don't communicate by squealing and squeaking.\"" Sari gets labeled a tramp by the school cliques when she falls in love with the most popular senior boy, David, and encourages him to break up with his long-time, devoted girlfriend, Thea. Sari's actions become more desperate, until Jess' betrayal thrusts the conflict into the school spotlight.
","The cover, with the title words plunging down a girl's low neckline and a ""laugh out loud funny and way twisted"" endorsement by Meg Cabot, give the wrong impression of this book's tone. It's an insightful, introspective story about the bonds -- and frailties -- of friendship. Jess is rather horrified by Sari's behavior, which includes drinking and casual oral sex. A popular clique (""the Prada Mafia"") comes off as stereotypical, but Fredericks avoids turning the older crush and his girlfriend into villains. Without didacticism, she highlights the drawbacks of Sari's sacrifices, even when Sari doesn't perceive them as such.
At times, the story bogs down and readers join Jess in wishing that Sari would just move on already. Teens may root for Sari's success with her true love, but Fredericks rightly sticks with the harsh reality of broken promises. Jess learns she can survive outside Sari's flamboyant shadow while still supporting her friend.","Parents need to know that a freshman girl's one-sided relationship with an older boy causes a rift between best friends. Despite knowing David has a steady girlfriend, Sari meets him once a week to perform oral sex because she is ""madly, psychotically in love"" with him. It doesn't end well, and the friends learn about forgiveness, unconditional support, and trusting one's own judgment. There's some drinking at teen parties and one girl gets drunk and throws up.

Small Beauties: The Journey of Darcy Heart O'Hara,"Small treasure explores Irish famine, emigration.","Darcy is the youngest of seven children (and the only girl), growing up in Ireland in the 1840s. When she's born, her grandmother predicts that \""One day this child shall hold the very heart of our family in the palm of her hand.\"" Though the family's farming life is hard, it's filled with joy as well, and Darcy is a noticer of little things, sometimes to her parents' exasperation.
But then the Irish Potato Blight begins, and the family has little to eat and no way to pay the rent. When they lose their house, they're forced to emigrate to America, leaving behind Darcy's grandparents, who are too old to make the voyage. But Darcy is about to make her grandmother's prediction come true in a most unexpected way.
Includes map and author's note.
","Sometimes it all just works. Elvira Woodruff's lyrical text, with just the hint of an Irish lilt, and Adam Rex's loving, luminous illustrations combine to lift SMALL BEAUTIES: THE JOURNEY OF DARCY HEART O'HARA -- a tale of sorrow and heartache -- into a gorgeous, moving, uplifting experience that can inspire children.
This focus on the little, seemingly insignificant things and their ultimate effect on the family (a theme illuminatingly continued in the author's note) gives the story unusual impact. How many children have their own hidden box of treasures -- stones, feathers, bits of broken things, etc? Kids who haven't spent their lives in front of a screen can relate to Darcy's openhearted embrace of her world and her collecting of meaningful objects, and will rejoice to see how much they come to mean to her family as well.","Parents need to know that sad things happen here: The family goes hungry, loses their home, and is forced to leave grandparents behind when emigrating.

Louise the Big Cheese: Divine Diva,Starry-eyed girl copes with disappointment in sparkly tale.,"Louise Cheese loves being in the limelight and dreams of being “a big cheese” -- a big star. Naturally, she feels destined to land the starring role in her school’s production of Cinderella. But her friend Fern is chosen to play Cinderella and Louise is devastated to learn she’ll be a mouse. Sulky Louise stops speaking to her friend and pretends to her parents that she has the wished-for role. But when performance time comes, Louise finally embraces her role -- and her friend.
","Louise, despite her self-centered obsession with stardom, is a sweet and charming little heroine. Her me-first focus would be more trying if it weren’t for her enthusiasm. Her ugly reaction to getting a bit part in the play rings true and will resonate with any child who has felt left out or passed over. Her family plays a strong secondary role, letting Louise work her way through this difficult situation while they offer loving support.
	The watercolor illustrations, saturated in pink and worked into the text, are lively, expressive, and full of fun details. Louise has behaved awfully to her friend, but it’s hard not to feel sorry for her as she stands before her parents in her bunny slippers and meekly admits she really won’t be Cinderella. And all must be forgiven when she smiles admiringly at her friend backstage, and then glows when it's her turn in the spotlight, even if she's just a mouse.
The watercolor illustrations, saturated in pink and worked into the text, are lively, expressive, and full of fun details.","Parents need to know there is little of concern in this tale of friendship and humility. Louise acts selfishly and is unkind to her friend, but by the time of the big show she’s learned to let go of her ego and share the stage. There are brief references to typical gossipy schoolgirl behavior -- the friends' silent spat persists even when another girl gets in trouble for coloring her nails with crayon and they have a substitute teacher ""with wrinkly knees.""

On their way home, Trixie realizes Knuffle Bunny is gone! She's just a toddler and can't speak yet, so she does her best to explain the problem to her bewildered father. She babbles. She bawls.

Our Earth,"Caves, volcanoes, and other Earth delights.","In this simple overview of the planet, deserts, rainforests, and salty seas, are delights for the eyes, and enchanting prose is a delight for the ears. As a primer, Our Earth serves its purpose -- to begin or expand upon a young child's knowledge of the magnificent world.
Author and illustrator Anne Rockwell gives toddlers and preschoolers one of their first looks at the planet earth -- presenting prehistoric dinosaurs, creeping glaciers, large continents and small islands. Each subject is reinforced by an almost full-page watercolor and gouache illustration. She ends the book with this message of harmony: \""Our big, round earth is very beautiful. It is my home and yours.\""
","Anne Rockwell's prose is beautiful, instilling a sense of wonder in young children. Her words can serve as a great starting point for a more in-depth discussion of one topic, such as deserts or glaciers, or as a larger discussion about the world around us.

Ira Sleeps Over,Humorous narrative brings Ira's world to life.,"To take his teddy bear, or not to take his teddy bear? That is the question facing Ira before his first-ever sleepover. Bernard Waber's much loved picture book explores some of the familiar dilemmas and insecurities of childhood, but with a sweetly comic twist. It turns out Ira's inclination was right all along: Even big boys need teddy bears.
 ","This book’s artwork, interesting pen-and-ink drawings with selective coloring, helps underscore the story's humor and has a little something extra for parents or older children returning to it. Sleeping over for the first time represents a major milestone. Even if it's just a matter of going next door to spend the night with your best friend, it can, as Ira discovers, present some unexpected dilemmas. What if you take your teddy bear and your best friend decides you're a baby? Should you follow the advice of your parents or your older sibling, or your own feelings?
Ira's parents encourage him to do what he wants to do. But, perhaps more relevant for preschoolers, the story acknowledges that other people are not always so supportive. Older siblings, themselves (supposedly) newly liberated from a dependency on teddy bears, can zero right in on one's vulnerabilities with devastating effect. ","Parents need to know that this humorous, first-person narrative is written in a very believable child's voice.

"It's Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex, and Sexual Health","Informative, updated, explicit sex ed book.","IT'S PERFECTLY NORMAL starts by defining sex: gender, reproduction, desire, and intercourse. It depicts different types of bodies and internal and external sex organs, then explains how girls' and boys' bodies -- and feelings -- change during puberty. The section on families discusses sexual intercourse, conception, pregnancy, birth, and other options for starting families (such as in vitro fertilization -- IVF -- and adoption). Another section focuses on making decisions about abstinence, postponing sexual intercourse, and using contraception, and outlines current U.S. laws regarding abortion. The final section covers online safety, sexual abuse, sexually transmitted infections, HIV/AIDS, and making healthy, responsible choices.
","Human sexuality is timeless but not unchanging -- and this fresh update of Robie H. Harris' 1994 classic helps guide kids coming of age at a time when digital media can be both a blessing and a curse. It's Perfectly Normal aims to arm kids with knowledge to make informed, thoughtful decisions about their sexual behavior and relationships, and it does so with a frankness that some families will find refreshing while others may feel it's inappropriate.
Harris and illustrator Michael Emberley take a straightforward and inclusive approach, portraying a diverse range of ethnicities and body types, discussing different religious and personal beliefs, and encouraging respect for individual preferences. They also dive into contemporary concerns about cyberbullying, respecting boundaries, sexting, and online pornography and misinformation. Parents should review it first to make sure it's right for their children and to prepare for follow-up conversations.","Parents need to know that the 20th-anniversary edition of It's Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex, and Sexual Health is an unflinching and fully illustrated guide to sexual health for girls and boys that presents sexual activity as enjoyable but requiring mature, careful decision-making. It supports postponing and abstaining from sex but also provides information on contraception and abortion. Author Robie H. Harris and illustrator Michael Emberley (whose collaborations for younger readers include It's Not the Stork! and It's So Amazing!) use both scientific language and slang to ensure both accuracy and relevance. Plentiful graphic illustrations show female and male genitalia, sexual intercourse, masturbation, childbirth, and more. The text is comprehensive and detailed, describing different types of sexual behavior (including, briefly, oral and anal sex), explaining what orgasm feels like, and comparing the availability and effectiveness of various forms of birth control.

My People,Photos bring sparkling tone to simple poem of celebration.,"In the late 1920s, Langston Hughes wrote this simple short poem to celebrate African American people. The photographs in this book translate his words into pictures and add to the celebration. Most are head shots showing smiles, eyes, and hopeful, happy faces. At the end, a message from the photographer explains just how he made the choices he did when choosing photographs to illustrate the poet's words.
","The poem is simple and short, and the photographs are expressive. Taken together, they create a wonderful reminder of just how special and unique people are.  While these photos are all of African American people, since that is whom Langston Hughes celebrates in his poem, the message applies to us all.
Sepia-toned photographs against a black background create a warm and happy tone for this poem of celebration.

"Chantress, Book 1",Strong heroine + exciting finish = fine tween/teen fantasy.,"Lucy was orphaned at age 8 when, as she was told, a shipwreck took her mother's life and stranded her and Norrie, her guardian, on a remote island. She doesn't know that Norrie is really trying to keep her and her magical chantress abilities safe from those who want to destroy them. However, the call of magic is too much for Lucy to ignore, and giving in to them transports her back to London and right into the heart of danger. As one of the last chantresses remaining, Lucy will need the help of Nat and the Invisible College as well as a lot of training from her godmother, Helaine, if she's going to put an end to the shadowgrims (magical ravens) for good.
","CHANTRESS is an entertaining fantasy with an engaging heroine who'll especially appeal to girls. Amy Butler Greenfield's writing is solid and at its best near the end, when the faster action and pacing make for exciting page turning. Older, more experienced readers will recognize a few clichés here and there. Good and bad characters are easy to recognize, and the outcome is predictable, which keeps the book firmly in the realm of an enjoyable genre piece particularly suited to tweens and younger teens.","Parents need to know that Chantress is a fantasy that takes place in a world in which magical people and abilities are dying out.

Bluebird,"Striking, vibrant tale of friendship, bullying, and loss.","A young, lonely boy has trouble making friends with peers. However, one day he meets a bluebird, who brings a dash of light -- and camaraderie -- into his otherwise heavy existence. As he and the bluebird set off to have a few adventures, including making new friends and facing down bullies, he discovers some big lessons about friendships.
","BLUEBIRD is a remarkable tale of loneliness and friendship, beautifully rendered in Photoshop with angular, geometric shapes and shadows that convey powerful emotions. It's all the more intriguing because it conveys so much with so few words; aside from a splash of text here or there, nearly all the work requires emotion-reading, and those emotions are no walk in the park: Bluebird deals with heavy themes such as isolation, bullying, and loss, some of which may be upsetting for certain readers.
However, for kids who've faced these issues, this might offer some catharsis and an appreciation for the bigger lessons of friendship. Parents can use this book as an opportunity to discuss bigger issues of bullying, loss, or grief, or simply to check in about school or friendships. Beyond all this, it's simply a great way to delve into the importance of emotional literacy and to discuss how we are able to divine how those around us are feeling.","Parents need to know that Bluebird is a largely images-only picture book that tells a story of loneliness, isolation, bullying, friendship, and loss.

Bluish,Fifth-grade girls learn tolerance and compassion.,"In this story based on the author's own positive family experience of cross-cultural living, three fifth-grade girls come together and learn tolerance and compassion for each other in an urban school environment. Their friendship centers around a girl called Bluish, who struggles with leukemia in and out of remission.
 ","In her unique tone and style, Virginia Hamilton tells the story of an uncommon friendship among three girls. The story is told in short episodes of third-person narrative, interrupted by Dreenie's first-person journal entries. This shift in perspective is sometimes confusing because the journal entries include events in real time and dialogue, rather than staying inside Dreenie's mind as observations.
A few of the scenes are stilted and border on didactic, as when the teacher explains Bluish's illness to the class and when her classmates learn about the dreidel. Hamilton's strength is in her language innovations, the way she tweaks a single word in a sentence to give it sound and personality. She never dwells on illness and cancer; rather, she reaches across it to explore the intricacies of friendship despite differences.","Parents need to know that contemporary language and expressions make for dialogue kids connect with, but the style makes it sometimes hard to follow.

She has more power to control fire after withstanding weeks of mental trials that have killed many in the mines. She'll need the extra magical strength to face Cress again, the Kaiserin and captor of her people who was made more powerful from a poisoning gone very wrong. As Theo and her advisers devise their next move to free more mines and build their forces, Theo begins to have intensely vivid dreams where Cress speaks to her. Theo is convinced there's a magical connection between them, one forged from the poison in their blood, and one that could be very dangerous if Cress finds out that she is still alive.  ","This finale stays on a low burner for the first half as characters wallow in doubt and indecision, then heats up to a satisfying storm-the-castle, defeat-the-villain finish. To be fair, much needs to be set up before the castle storming can begin, much of it intriguing. Theo's link to Cress in dreams adds a creepy layer and keeps readers in touch with Cress' diabolical plans: She forms the most Goth girl group ever. And while it seems to take forever for Soren, the love interest, to come back into the story, he does in dramatic fashion. Unfortunately, amid these developments, readers will have to sit through meetings in tents where no one agrees where to attack next and long moments of soul searching from Theo about all her failings and bad decisions thus far. These sections could have been cut down significantly or woven more into the action.
Still, the last 100 pages roll along quickly, especially because the stakes are so high. Losing the war is not an option when a whole people will suffer in slavery, and winning with so few troops and some half-baked plans always makes for a compelling underdog tale.","Parents need to know that Ember Queen is the third and final book in the Ash Princess fantasy series for mature teen readers. Expect many deaths as the main character, 17-year-old Queen Theodosia (Theo), tries to take back her kingdom from those who enslaved and tortured her people for a decade. Most bloodshed is at a distance, with the help of fire and other magic, but there are a few deaths up close, including a slit throat, a couple of daggers to the gut and heart, poisonings, and drownings. There's much talk of torture that characters close to Theo endure -- one man had his eye plucked out. Other mature content includes frequent wine drinking, the rare swear word (""ass,"" ""bitch,"" ""bastards""), and one scene of sex that's not described beyond kissing, undressing, and consenting. The desire for freedom from oppression drives Theo and the whole story. The cost of that freedom is often weighed: How many is too many to sacrifice for the cause? Theo pulls herself out of despair over loss and indecision with the help of her steadfast and brave friends.

","The fun, out-of-this world Gabby Duran series touches on broad themes of acceptance and integrity, on having fun and juggling priorities, and on how it feels to disappoint someone you care about. With so many layers, readers will quickly see that these aren’t simple stories about a girl’s babysitting adventures. Despite the fact that Gabby’s charges are aliens,  her priorities are very much down to Earth. She loves her family and friends, tries hard at school and band, and always wants to do the right thing. Her relationship with her sister Carmen is real and beautifully simple. Gabby doesn’t get exasperated when Carmen takes everything literally, and appreciates Carmen’s love of structure and rules. Carmen manages the family’s finances and schedules in thick binders, and can calculate the cost of a ruined meal in seconds. Gabby sees Carmen’s differences as unique strengths, not as something to change.","Parents need to know that the Gabby Duran series from Elise Allen and Daryle Conners is full of adventure and suspense – and also silliness, wit, and heartwarming moments. Even human children can act like aliens sometimes, and the best way to enjoy time with them is to engage, to get to know them. Throughout the series, there’s a big emphasis on accepting people (or aliens) for who they are, and always looking for the good in people and thinking about the “why” of others' behavior -- even when it’s her band nemesis or an angry alien chasing her through a park. Gabby says that her sister is different. Not better or worse, just different, with her own way of looking at the world. The authors don’t attach a label to her behavior, and Gabby values Carmen’s unique abilities and doesn’t try to get her to be less Carmen-y. The series is written very naturally, showing different personalities and gifts, just like our real, non-alien world -- and it’s a really fun read.

The Boy Who Lost Fairyland,Changelings return to Fairyland in twist to dazzling series.,"As the story opens, Hawthorn, a troll infant dazzled by the blandishments of the Red Wind, is swept away from Fairyland and swapped for Thomas, the baby of a Chicago couple. This doesn't turn out so well, as his human parents can't deal with his wild enthusiasms and just want him to be ""normal."" But on his first day of school, he makes a friend, Tamburlaine, and over time they realize they're both changelings and have unexpected powers. Tamburlaine paints vivid pictures of a place she can barely remember, and one day the kids, accompanied by a suddenly alive stuffed patchwork wombat, a walking gramophone who can only converse in song lyrics, and the baseball the Red Wind had left with infant Thomas, walk through the wall into Fairyland. This is where, after many adventures and the occasional reappearance of characters from the earlier books, their story connects with that of September -- who, at the end of Book 3, was stuck in a very perilous situation.
","Kids who like their language simple and their universes orderly have probably long since bailed on the Fairyland series. In particular, they may have tired of uthor Catherynne M. Valente's fondness for wild images and pure delight in yanking the rug out from characters and readers alike at frequent intervals. But, although she's not going to be everyone's dish, Valente's narrator is that rare jewel: She has ll this under control and dispenses assorted reassuring asides but also doesn't take herself too seriously. Which is a big part of what makes you willing to cut Valente some slack when she launches the fourth book in a five-part series by introducing a protagonist you've never heard of, and she makes you care deeply about the plight and future of THE BOY WHO LOST FAIRYLAND. She dazzles you with language, cracks you up, and breaks your heart, often in the same paragraph, such as this one:
""Thomas Rood had a naked heart, even when the rest of him was bundled up in hats and mittens in the depths of winter. And it was this naked heart that hurled itself at everything, at lamps and toys and flagstones and draperies. Thomas could not help it. All his life he had known that something was wrong. It was only that he did not know what it was. He felt all the time as though there were another boy inside him, a bigger boy, a stronger boy, a boy who knew impossible things, a boy so wonderful he could talk to jewels and make friends with fire. But whenever he tried to let that boy out, he was only Thomas, red-faced, sputtering, gangly, clench-fist Thomas.""","Parents need to know that The Boy Who Lost Fairyland, the fourth book in Catherynne M. Valente's five-volume Fairyland series, throws readers a curve by devoting most of its pages to characters we've never seen before, including the one referred to in the title. Once again, the language is exuberantly lush, the characters intriguing and relatable, and the plot a never-ending series of unexpected developments. It's a natural for kids who love gorgeous words, sly historic and cultural references, and cosmic peril. Some violence is cartoonish (such as a character stabbing a monster), while there's some emotional abuse (for example, a changeling character's parents can't stand the fact that he's not ""normal""). Sex is not really on the radar of the 12-year-old (in human years) protagonists, although a few passing narrative remarks dance humorously around the issue. There's a bit of playful gender-bending, as some female characters have male names and vice versa.

Penguin,"Charming, whimsical boy-meets-bird tale.","After Ben receives a penguin as a present, he tries everything he can think of to make him talk. However, he has absolutely no luck, and in his frustration yells very loudly, \""Say Something!\"" This irritates a passing lion, who swallows Ben in a single gulp. Finally, penguin steps into action, and well, we finally learn what it takes to make a penguin talk.
","Kids will love the silliness of this story in much the same way as they love the Pigeon books. The penguin has character, and his stubbornness almost unhinges Ben. In the end, it takes a pretty drastic move to break the ice and start the two toward an understanding friendship. Kids will love that too.
Polly Dunbar's multimedia illustrations are cute, simple, and uncluttered. With whimsical flair, her lines perfectly express both Ben's changing moods and the penguin's bemused silence. Nothing extra is included in this story of the chubby-cheeked, pajama-clad boy and his developing relationship with the very quiet penguin. Kids will enjoy its playful tone; adults will love its charm.","Parents need to know that this is a cute story that is meant to be light and silly.

"Infinity Son: Infinity Cycle, Book 1","Diverse cast, complex characters shine in superhero fantasy.","Told primarily in Emil and Brighton's alternating perspectives, INFINITY SON follows the twins as their lives get upended by a long-held secret about Emil's identity. They always dreamed of being celestials, or people with superhero abilities, but as their 18th birthday winds down, neither appears to have latent magical powers. When they're attacked by specters, Emil discovers he has phoenix fire, but this is not a celestial power; only specters gain this kind of magic by stealing it from magical creatures. Emil would never consume phoenix blood, but before they can unravel that mystery, Brighton, who hopes that his social media channels will make him famous, uploads a video of the fight online to his ""Celestials of New York"" platform, and Emil is launched into superstardom. The brothers find themselves caught in a generations-long war between the Spell Walkers, a superhero vigilante group fighting for the end of celestial persecution, and the Blood Casters, a group of specters who are seeking to create immortality. Emil, with the help of the Spell Walkers and support of his brother, might be the only person who can stop the Blood Casters from achieving their nefarious goal. A cliffhanger ending with a twist threatens Emil and Brighton's bond, as well as the safety of the world.
","This fast-paced, compelling story is a refreshing contribution to the superhero fantasy genre. Infinity Son has leads who are people of color, queer, and from various class backgrounds, so the cast is realistic and relatable. Emil is particularly compelling. His journey toward courage and self-love is captivating, especially contrasted to his brother's spiraling resentments that take him further away from Emil. This magic-heavy tale is grounded in a futuristic New York City that never feels far from reality. The constant use of social media and the political mess of the book means readers will be able to draw parallels to real life. Themes including the trauma of war, loss and grief, revenge, and the complexity of family relationships don't underestimate the teen reader's ability to handle hard realities. There is a fair amount of violence, but its fantasy context means that even high body count battles don't feel too gory. The death of a key character (and its aftermath) will be an emotional gut-punch, but a familiar one for anyone who has read Silvera's other books. The cliffhanger ending will keep readers on the lookout for the next book in this promising new series.","Parents need to know that Infinity Son by Adam Silvera (They Both Die at the End) is the first book in his debut fantasy series, Infinity Cycle. A shocking revelation about Emil's identity pushes him and his twin brother, Brighton, into a war between magical beings that threatens to destroy everything they know and love. There are positive messages about love, compassion, family, and friendship. Sensitive Emil and ambitious Brighton are relatable characters. They have ups and downs as twins, but their loyalty shines and they aspire to make a positive difference. Most major characters are people of color, and several characters are queer, including Emil, though it's not central to the story. People of all genders are represented and respected. Bloody and deadly battle scenes between magical beings involve weapons such as daggers, flight, fire darts, wands, and gem grenades, as well as hand-to-hand fighting. Characters repeatedly face grave danger and a key character dies tragically. No kissing or sex, though two male characters appear attracted to one each other. Other characters are in same-gender and opposite-gender relationships. Strong language is limited to a few uses of ""hell.""

The Demigod Diaries: The Heroes of Olympus,Exciting stories plus backstory on popular half-god heroes.,"Rick Riordan's THE DEMIGOD DIARIES includes four new stories about the half-Greek-god characters popularized in the Percy Jackson and Heroes of Olympus series. In ""The Diary of Luke Castellan,"" Luke and Thalia are lured to a mansion full of hideous beasts. In ""Percy Jackson and the Staff of Hermes,"" Percy and Annabeth are recruited by the messenger god to retrieve stolen goods. ""Leo Valdez and the Quest for Buford,"" tells about Leo, Piper, and Jason's search for an escaped piece of furniture. And ""Son of Magic,"" by Riordan's son, Haley, tackles the gods' and man's notions about what separates life and death. The book also contains activities for kids: a word search, word scramble, and matching game.
","Riordan's Greek books are page-turners for middle-graders and middle schoolers, and though this one doesn't stand very well on its own, it offers a similarly entertaining reading experience. With clever modern teen and kid characters, amusingly flawed gods, and scary-weird monsters, Riordan creates a world that thrills and fascinates young readers.
The book's first two stories in particular, ""The Diary of Luke Castellan"" and ""Percy Jackson and the Staff of Hermes,"" combine adventure, humor, and feeling in very effective ways. While Haley Riordan's story, ""Son of Magic,"" lacks the levity of his dad's pieces, it literally addresses the fictional characters' questions and ideas about the afterlife; it's very well-rendered and an impressive work by a teen writer.","Parents need to know that The Demigod Diaries, a book of short stories connected to Rick Riordan's best-selling Heroes of Olympus series, includes backstory about the characters in Riordan's other Olympus and Percy Jackson books, plus a few fun activities. Younger readers may find the stories' monsters and violence frightening, though if kids are used to Riordan's other fantasy novels, they'll do fine with this book. The fantastical creatures are described horrifically: huge horse/lion/wolf beasts with clacking bone teeth, a powerful evil giant, and nymphs with fangs and claws like serpents. Riordan describes animals being torn and devoured, a person being burned to death, and an immortal, who, when wounded, turns partly to sand and then regenerates. Riordan also includes an explanation of the origin of his popular Percy Jackson character, who has ADHD, showing Percy as a great role model for kids with learning disabilities.

Goblin Secrets,"Orphan boy seeks lost brother in exciting, funny tale.","Rownie, an orphan boy of uncertain age (he's told he's 8, but thinks he's 10) lives, along with other waifs, with the witch Graba, who walks on clockwork bird's legs, tends to be possessive, and has a rare skill with curses. He's worried about his older brother, Rowan, who hasn't been heard from for weeks. Rowan's a budding actor, but in the city of Zombay, where they all live, all forms of theater are forbidden by government edict -- and clockwork-enhanced enforcers keep an eye out for violators. Dispatched on an errand for Graba, Rownie learns of an upcoming theatrical performance by goblins, impulsively steals Graba's money, and runs off with the goblins. He's hoping to learn more about his brother, but along the way picks up acting skills and life lessons.
","GOBLIN SECRETS delights critics as well as readers for its intriguing world, its characters, their daily adventures, and the struggles they face. As Rownie flees his pursuers, makes new friends, and seeks his missing brother, he also delves into the fascinating world of the theater, where fiction, reality, and magic converge.","Parents need to know that there's a gothic, steampunk vibe to the world of Goblin Secrets, with sinister, yet often comical, part-clockwork villains and engines fueled by hearts cut from their owners and burned.

Firefly Hollow,"Sweet, poignant tale of loss, friendship, following dreams.","In the world of FIREFLY HOLLOW, young Cricket and Firefly aren't like the other youngsters of their species: Cricket wants to learn to catch, like Yogi Berra, because if he could have caught the flying lollipop stick that flew through the air and hit her, his friend Gloria wouldn't be disabled; and Firefly wants to leave the Hollow and fly to the moon. Also, they break their elders' biggest rule when they make friends with a human boy, Peter, who's devastated by the death of his friend. Meanwhile Vole, last of a seafaring race wiped out by a long-ago flood, dreams of setting sail.
","Sweet and relatable, this charming tale of independent-minded youngsters following their dreams and coping with loss may be too emotionally intense for some readers.

Mr. and Mrs. Bunny -- Detectives Extraordinaire!,"Wacky, charming tale of girl and bunnies to the rescue.","Ten-year-old Madeline appears to be the only one on Hornby Island, an enclave of American hippies in British Columbia, to have any practical sense whatever. Also, she's read Pride and Prejudice twice. When her feckless parents suddenly disappear, apparently kidnapped by foxes, Madeline's only assistance in finding and rescuing them comes in the form of a pair of rabbits who've just decided to go into the detective business. A code-breaking marmot, faux foxhounds, The Olde Spaghetti Factory, and Prince Charles all play a role in the ensuing hijinks.
","Polly Horvath has a long track record of wacky books, and some of the zaniness in this one, as well as the madcap plot, may be too much for some.
But the title characters and Madeline are very appealing -- as are Sophie Blackall's illustrations. And if there's an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink quality to some of the comic embellishments, there are also moments of enduring charm, sweetness, and triumph.","Parents need to know that the overall tone of Mr. and Mrs. Bunny -- Detectives Extraordinaire! is chaotic and irreverent. Its resourceful 10-year-old heroine, Madeline, is far more responsible for her hippie parents than they've ever been for her, and a pair of bunnies do an exemplary job of modeling mature adult values, ingenious problem solving, and generally saving the day, with a hefty dose of comedy on the side.

"Beast of Stone: Wing & Claw, Book 3",Animal series finale satisfies with many solid messages.,"In BEAST OF STONE: WING & CLAW, BOOK 3, Raffa narrowly escapes prison and the Chancellor's grasp and follows a secret exodus of the slums into the Forest of Wonders. The Chancellor is determined to gut the slums and expel all the people she calls Afters: those who settled in Gilden after a great earthquake ruined their homelands. It's not long before the Chancellor notices where the Afters have gone -- not far away enough for her -- and sends her substance-controlled animals to attack them. Those who make it to a camp know it won't be long before soldiers arrive. With no weapons and just the forest to protect them, it's up to young Raffa the apothecary to teach everyone how to use what's available to them in the forest. The Afters, Raffa, and his friends know they can't avoid a battle, but hope to save as many people and animals as possible.
","The satisfying conclusion to this animal fantasy series is full of solid messages about truth, nonviolence, and compassion for animals and displaced people. It's a great discussion book for conscientious kids and exciting enough that it doesn't feel like just a discussion book. The main character, Raffa, is adept at problem-solving with just the botanicals offered to him by the forest. As readers wait for the final battle, the ingenious preparations Raffa makes to protect those he cares about help pass the time.
What's refreshing about Beast of Stone is that characters spend as much time in their battle preparations discussing how to stop the soldiers and animals coming for them as they do on how to cause the least lasting harm. That awareness about the enslaved animals deserving their freedom more than death, even if they are trained to bite and kill, keeps readers thinking far beyond friend and foe, good and evil. The evil here is the violence and intolerance itself, and defeating those things, more than specific people in power, leads to the satisfying and extremely hopeful conclusion.","Parents need to know that Beast of Stone is the third and final book in the Wing & Claw fantasy series by Newbery Medal winner Linda Sue Park (A Single Shard). It's a great fit for animal-loving kids who are just digging into fantasy, but expect some violence involving substance-controlled animals. They bite and attack people; one boy loses his leg to a bite, and there's talk of a few others killed. There's also a stabbing death of a beloved human character and threats that more beloved characters will be executed. What stands out more than the brief fighting, however, is the drive for displaced people who are discriminated against to fight for themselves with the least amount of violence used. They would rather find a way to free the animals and reason with soldiers. The main character, Raffa, is a boy who weighs right and wrong with great care. When he lies and realizes his lie may hurt others, he stands up, admits he lied, and accepts the consequences.

She and her free-spirited single mother have a business creating herbal and flower elixirs for clients in search of romance. The problem is, Mimosa's mother has her working almost full time in the business. Only recently has she llowed her daughter to enroll in high school rather than continue to be homeschooled. Mimosa's thrilled about attending school, but it isn't long before her gift begins to get her into all kinds of trouble. An elixir created to help her algebra teacher woo the school librarian is accidentally taken by the mother of Court, a boy Mimosa really likes.

And what if she can't find the recipe she needs to make a fall-out-of-love potion for Court's mother? If this isn't trouble enough, Mimosa thinks she's lost her ""nose"" after an innocent kiss with Court.  ","This offbeat and engaging coming-of-age novel is an utterly captivating and sometimes zany mixture of romance, fantasy, and the challenges of contemporary teen life. While a plot line built around magical elixirs may seem a bit far fetched, the story is grounded by the smart and relatable character of Mimosa. Readers who are fans of fantasy will love elements like the potion Mimosa sprays on boys to keep them from falling in love with her. Readers looking for a darker story that tackles issues around drugs or teen sex should look elsewhere. ","Parents need to know that Stacey Lee's The Secret of a Heart Note is the story of 15-year-old Mimosa and the extraordinary gift she shares with her mother. They are the last in a centuries-old line of aromateurs, women whose hypersensitive sense of smell lets them create elixirs that help people fall in (and out of) love. Unfortunately, family lore holds that if n aromateur falls in love herself, she will lose her gift. This presents a heartrending conflict for Mimosa, who wants to be a normal high school student hanging out with friends, playing sports nd most of all, having a boyfriend.

","Debut novelist Ryan Calejo brings a refreshing Latino twist to a middle-grade fantasy adventure. And there's lots of appeal for fans of Percy Jackson-type excitement. Charlie Hernández & The League of Shadows move the story along from one close call to the next, until the satisfying ending that leaves the door open for further adventures.
Readers will learn a lot about folklore from both the Old and New Worlds, and tweens will relate to Charlie as he learns to accept himself and his body, and to appreciate his strange, new powers. The structure of the plot gets pretty repetitive, but younger readers likely won't mind as each step along the way features a creepily fascinating figure from ancient folk tales. Dark atmospheres, frequent peril, rare strong language, and many undead or underworld fantasy creatures make it best for tweens and up.","Parents need to know that Ryan Calejo's Charlie Hernández & The League of Shadows is a fantasy-adventure for tweens that draws heavily on folklore from many Spanish-speaking countries around the world. Charlie's parents are missing so dealing with parental loss is a theme, along with remembering a past destructive house fire and going back to what remains. Lots of positive Latino role models and representations in the characters and in the frequent use of Spanish words and phrases. Lots of peril and fights with fantasy and supernatural beings from folklore, and lots of dark, creepy locations, too. Except for a school bully, all other violence is in the realm of fantasy, but blood's mentioned a few times and pain is described. Youngest readers may need help clarifying the calaca's argument about why folklore and its creatures are real. Rare strong language includes ""jackass"" and ""damn."" Lots of gross-out moments like eating worms, messing your pants, and a slobbery, tentacled tongue dd tween appeal. Mild feelings of romantic interest and attraction and a couple of hugs. Explores themes about the links between culture and folklore, as well as about accepting yourself and your body as it changes and becomes something weird and new.

Calvin,"Quirky, compelling tale of schizophrenic teen on quest.","Seventeen-year-old Canadian kid CALVIN has always had a cosmic connection to cartoonist Bill Watterson and his legendary Calvin and Hobbes comic strip (syndicated 1985-1995) since he was born on the day the last strip ran and his grandfather named him after the character. So, when he's diagnosed with schizophrenia in the wake of a meltdown at school -- caused in part by the sudden reappearance of Hobbes, his long-gone stuffed tiger/boon companion -- he figures Watterson can cure him by drawing a strip of him healthy and Hobbes-less. Soon he's walking across a frozen Lake Erie in hopes of meeting the cartoonist, accompanied by longtime friend Susie and also by Hobbes, both of whom may be hallucinations. The story is written in the form of a letter to Watterson.
","A good knowledge of legendary comic strip Calvin and Hobbes may not be absolutely necessary to appreciate Canadian author Martine Leavitt's engaging, oddball story, but it sure helps. Especially when the narrative switches (as it often does) to the adventures of cartoon Calvin's alter ego Spaceman Spiff in mid-crisis. Fans of the strip will revel in the alternate realities, the shout-outs and the in-jokes, while newbies may be more than a bit at sea. Awkward, brilliant Calvin's probably distorted perspective and constant uncertainty about what's real and what's not are part of what makes the narrative compelling. But real girl or imaginary figment, Susie's the star here, tenacious in friendship and taking no nonsense. What's not to love about things like her exchange with the reclusive ice fisherman who gives the teens some much-needed help:
""Noah: I'm a poet. We need solitude.
""Susie: So as long as you make a poem out of it, it's OK to hurt people?
""Noah: Art is the pinnacle of human achievement.
""Susie: Being a decent human being is the pinnacle of human achievement.""","Parents need to know that Calvin is the story of a Canadian 17-year-old just diagnosed with schizophrenia who embarks on a dangerous midwinter trek across Lake Erie to find reclusive Calvin and Hobbes cartoonist Bill Watterson. In fact, it's written in the form of a letter to Watterson. The teen is accompanied by companions Susie and Hobbes, who (along with assorted perils they encounter) may or may not exist. In Calvin's own mind, the quest makes perfect sense; wiser souls try to keep him safe. Though there's little content that's problematic for younger readers (teens exchange heartfelt kisses, and the strongest language is ""crap""), the story requires a certain maturity and the ability to navigate a narrative that's part mythic quest, part teen romance, part psychodrama, and part hallucination. It also assumes an acquaintance with the Calvin and Hobbes comic strip.

But just as they're leaving, a bomb explodes, separating them nd leaving Nadia injured and alone. As she struggles to avoid danger, get to Turkey, and find her family, she joins Basel, a younger boy, and Mazen, an old bookseller with a cart and a faithful donkey. Making their perilous way out of deserted, bombed-out Aleppo, they meet many scary characters, but also many others trying to do something positive and save what they can of Syria's ancient culture. Flashbacks tell how the country's conflicts began, and how it affected the lives of regular people caught between warring forces.
","N.H. Senzai's tale of a teen fleeing Syria in 2013 offers plenty of heart, courage, and poignant moments conveying what it's like to have your life completely destroyed by forces beyond your control. Some readers will be fascinated by the wealth of history, culture, and in-depth discussion of how the Arab Spring unfolded across the Middle East, while others may be a bit overwhelmed. With an appealing heroine (and her cat) and a lot of positive messages about family, courage, and kindness, Escape from Aleppo is a good bet for kids who like current events and multicultural stories -- and also fans of dystopian stories, with its setting to rival postapocalyptic landscapes.","Parents need to know that Escape from Aleppo, by acclaimed author N.H.

Frank knows his parents won't approve of Brit, so he turns to Joy Song, a family friend who's in a similar situation with her Chinese-American boyfriend.

The Junction of Sunshine and Lucky,Girl turns trash into treasures in hopeful underdog tale.,"At their new school, fifth-grader Auggie's best friend Lexie is lured away by Victoria, a wealthy classmate. Worse, Victoria's father starts a House Beautification Committee (""Making our city beautiful, one house at a time"") that targets Auggie and all her neighbors in the poor section of town and insists that they improve their homes. Auggie's grandfather, who runs a salvage business, collects items with which they create a colorful new look with ingenuity and creativity -- turning a worn-out toaster into a rooftop flower, for example. Their project horrifies the committee even more, and it deems their home in violation and demands a hefty fine, which Auggies' family can't afford. Eviction looks probable -- until a folk-art museum director sees what they've created, and the town's concept of what's beautiful changes.

It's Kind of a Funny Story,"Brilliant, edgy story about suicide best for mature teens.","Craig Gilner, who loved to doodle as a child, gets serious about preparing for the entrance exam to the prestigious Executive Pre-Professional High School in Manhattan. Opening the fat acceptance envelope is the happiest moment in Craig's young life, and it's downhill from there. Nine months later, unable to compete with his classmates, unable to accept his best friend's relationship with a sexy girlfriend, unable even to hold down his food, 15-year-old Craig rises early one morning with a plan to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge. Instead, he walks into the emergency room of a nearby hospital ... and into the adult psychiatric unit, where he faces his anxieties and his art flourishes.
","There are a few cliched characters, such as Craig's adoring younger sibling and bumbling dad, but what sets this book apart is the quality of writing. The pain of having an endless to-do list for school, of trying to keep one step ahead on the good-grades, good-college, good-job track, of trying to please parents who mean well but also keep a sharp eye on their bright child's ""amazing journey"" -- this is the pain that IT'S KIND OF A FUNNY STORY compellingly describes, and that many kids can relate to.  Craig describes the accessory-heavy style of his dreamgirl classmate this way: ""I think her accessories were a courtesy meant to distract from her small, lucrative body and baby-doll face."" A parent-free teen party in a Manhattan apartment is rendered in wild, sensational detail, and so is a poker game played by a cast of mentally stricken patients. If your teen is ready for the graphic (but not lewd) descriptions of petting and the pervasive use of drugs, this will be a dazzling read.   ","Parents need to know that It's Kind of a Funny Story deals with teen depression and suicide, and is based on author Ned Vizzini's five days in the adult psychiatric unit of a Brooklyn hospital. It's the story of 15-year-old Craig, a high school freshman who collapses under the pressures of a demanding school, sexual desire, jealousy, and party drugs. The book's eye is on the humorous and its ear catches the way teens, a middle-class New York family, hospital staffers, and phychiatric patients talk and interact. It's sometimes raw and always entertaining. No sexual intercourse is depicted, but there are scenes of petting, as well as teen use of marijuana and alcohol, and snorting the prescription drug Ritalin, and discussion of adults who use drugs to mask depression. But Craig has a solid, loving family, and is a good role model in that he seeks help in dealing with his depression. The book was made into a movie of the same name in 2010.

Leviathan,Fast-paced World War I fantasy exciting yet low on violence.,"In 1914, the real Archduke Ferdinand is murdered. His fictional heir, Prince Alek, hides his identity and takes refuge with the Clankers, who battle with machines driven by steam. Young Deryn, a girl, disguises herself as a boy and joins the Darwinists, creators of great battle animals such as the Leviathan through genetic engineering. When the Leviathan airship crashes on a mountaintop, Alek is captured by the Darwinists and ultimately finds himself looking for ways to save his former enemies, helping them repair the Leviathan by utilizing Clanker technology. His fear that their creatures are evil decreases as he discovers the symbiotic world that is Leviathan: bats, birds, glowworms, sniffers ... and enemy soldiers who are just as idealistic and virtuous as he is. The war is soon full on, and a great cliffhanger ending leaves readers wondering which way it will go.
","A brilliant imagination and a sense of humor have blended in this excellent example of steampunk. This alternative history throws in historical figures such as Winston Churchill and Nora Darwin Barlow, quotes the poet Goethe, and sets the coming-of-age stories of Prince Alek and Deryn, young airman of the Darwin army, on a parallel course of nonstop adventure. The political intrigue and momentum of war brewing only add to the compelling plot and very likable characters.
There is much humor, fantasy, and innovation in this historical setting. Westerfield has included a long afterword that defines what is fictional and what is fact. Gender roles are even tossed: Deryn is the swashbuckling, risk-taking one, while Alek is the sensitive, war-adverse prince. The author is bound to win over plenty of fans who will doubtless be clamoring for the sequel.","Parents need to know that for a fast-paced adventure story set during WWI there is surprisingly little violence. There are some battles that culminate in deaths and injuries, but there is very little blood and no gore. Genetically engineered fighting creatures include bats that eat and then expel metal spikes over enemies. While the background is war, the main stories are that of Alek and Deryn, and their adventures as they are both on their own for the first time away from their families.

Here part-angels hide out in a ""gifted"" program and get ready for a big Heaven-Hell war in the possible future. While Daniel is off doing important fallen angel things, Luce, who's kind of a celebrity with the celestial crowd, makes new friends, and gets into the kind of trouble Daniel and her teachers warned her about: leaving campus brings her closer to other celestial beings who want to harm her. And then there are the shadows or glimpses of her past life she can summon at will and start to control, but at what cost?
","This book is romance purgatory -- stuck and seemingly going nowhere. Oh sure, Lauren Kate had a good thing going in the first book -- that is, if you liked Twilight at all and wished the vampires really had wings instead. The true-love romance had plenty of intensity, the reform-school setting was good fun, and the fantasy elements were vague but going somewhere ... or so you'd think. Daniel and Luce do a lot of bickering over whether or not Daniel is too controlling -- um, he's trying to save your life and if he says it's not safe to leave campus maybe you should listen. Luce's glimpses at past lives start to get interesting, but reveal next to nothing to keep the plot moving. Danger comes and is gone just as fast, Daniel swoops in for a kiss; gone again -- there's little to hold the book together. Only at the very end does TORMENT take a turn that seems to really go somewhere. Too bad it took that long.","Parents need to know that if they let their teen read Twilight, they will probably also be fine with this series about angels.

Internment,"Teens fight back in chilling, timely dystopian thriller.","One thing 17-year-old Layla Amin never thought she'd face in life was INTERNMENT by the American government simply because she and her family are Muslim. She lives with her professor father and chiropractor mother in what had always been a liberal college town in California. Her parents aren't particularly religious and her boyfriend, David, is Jewish. How could anyone possibly think they're potential terrorists? But two and a half years ago, a new president was elected, and what followed was a rapid unraveling of democracy -- 18 months since America enacted a Muslim ban, one year since questions on a census landed Muslims on a registry, nine months since the first book burning, and one month since the president declared that ""Muslims are a threat to America."" When the Exclusion Authority arrives to ""relocate"" the family, there's no outcry from the neighbors they once considered friends. The family joins thousands of other Muslims at Camp Mobius in the high desert of California, where they have ID numbers stamped on the inside of their wrists. The camp director and guards make no effort to hide their racism and Islamophobia and think nothing of using violence to keep the internees in check. But Layla and a group of friends decide to fight back. With the help of an unexpected ally inside the camp, she's able to contact David and begin to send a series of blog posts to the outside world.
","This must-read novel poses a powerful question to readers -- could American democracy be endangered or possibly even destroyed by a culture of fear, racism, and hate? The storyline of Internment has numerous references and comparisons (some subtle and some with explanations) to the deportation of Jews during the Holocaust and the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, which some readers may not immediately understand. But this offers an excellent opportunity for teens and parents to talk about why minorities are so often targeted (even in democracies) and what lessons can be learned from these past tragedies.
An Author’s Note at the end begins, “When fascism comes to America, it will come draped in the flag.” The note gives background on the Japanese American interment and also discusses the current internment camps for people crossing the border and how Latinx characters are portrayed on TV. ","Parents need to know that Samira Ahmed's Internment is a chilling and timely novel set in a near-future America. Muslim Americans are now on a ""registry,"" Exclusion Laws have been enacted, and the president has just declared, ""Muslims are a threat to America."" For 17-year-old Layla Amin, it's unthinkable that her neighbors would find her family a threat. But the unthinkable happens when men from the Exclusion Authority arrive at their home and announce they're being relocated. The Amins re sent, along with thousands of other Muslims, to n interment camp surrounded by watchtowers, electric fences, and armed guards. As a sense of hopelessness begins to overwhelm many of the internees, Layla and a group of friends decide to fight back and form a resistance movement within the camp. Violence and the threat of violence are a constant in the story.  People are beaten and disappear from the camp, a man is electrocuted and another shot and killed. There's some profanity (""f--k,"" ""a--hole,"" ""bulls--t""). This controversial storyline is sure to spark serious discussion and debate between readers who find its premise all too possible and those who believe it could never happen in America.

But she sticks with the Flamels, who, without the Codex that Dee stole, will die in days. She intends to slip into her Aunt Agnes' for a change of clothes (and as few explanations as possible) when she's hit with a big surprise: Aunt Agnes is really one of the oldest humani alive and has special messages for Sophie and Josh for when the end is near. Meanwhile, Scathach, Joan of Arc, Saint Germain, Shakespeare, Palamedes, and a mysterious hook-handed man travel through shadowrealms to finally arrive in Danu Talis (aka Atlantis) right before its fall. If it doesn't fall, the humani will never exist. But how can the immortals ensure its destruction when they're captured and hauled into an active volcano?
","We're on book five now, and watching the author's ambitious melding of many myths, eras, cultures, belief systems, and crazy creatures has been extremely edu-taining. And at this point, readers are quite invested (it's practically guaranteed that they've spent some time on Wikipedia looking up Scathach, the sphinx, the world tree, Gilgamesh, and many other pieces of and characters in the story). But the heart of the story is the twins and their awakening. Or at least it was. In THE WARLOCK, they never get to show off their powers or save the day in any way. They're in mopey ""how'd I get myself into this end of the world stuff?"" mode. And Josh, his every thought tainted by a cursed sword, is barely there at all. Readers will miss having the siblings anchor this volume and may find the split story and myriad characters recalling myriad moments in the past even more distracting and muddled this time around. Warlock's saving grace? The very last page. Yup. It'll really get readers wondering how the series will all end. Let's hope the last book will hold together better than this one did.","Parents need to know that this is the second-to-last book in the Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel fantasy series.

Expect middle-of-the-road violence for a fantasy novel, including a giant many-headed snake and nasty mermaids set to do the most damage. A high-speed chase in flying saucers also puts characters at risk, and two central characters only have a day left to live.

Wildcard raises its stakes right from the beginning, and author Marie Lu orchestrates a couple of jaw-dropping plot turns.

Some of the fight scenes go on too long, but readers who enjoyed Warcross will be satisfied by the breakneck conclusion to the saga.

Upon finding a blue leather bookmark in the pages of a castle book, they wing their way via traveling treehouse to the Middle Ages.
Here, they witness a feast in the Great Hall. When they are questioned, \""Who art thou?\"" the two run for cover, finding themselves caught in a room full of armor. Three unsavory guards corner them in the dungeon, until Annie pretends her flashlight is a magic wand and stuns them.
A trapdoor provides easy escape into the moat filled with crocodiles, when along comes a knight on horseback, delivering them to safety. At home, Jack notices an M on the bookmark, and concludes that the same person who dropped the coin in the first adventure also owns the books and is responsible for the magic in the tree house.
","The Middle Ages fascinate kids, but this is one flying tree house adventure with a ho-hum plot that never really gets off the ground. Jack does his usual observing, and Annie her characteristic disappearing act, but witnessing the Middle Ages from doorways and through windows is not enough.
Still, kids will find a dash of humor to enjoy, such as eating peacocks, the silly names of the three guardsmen -- Squinty, Mustache, and Red (who ask them if they are ""Spies? Foreigners? Egyptians? Romans? [or] Persians?"") -- not to mention the moment when the two central characters discover the meaning of precipice and tumble into a moat.","Parents need to know that there's nothing of concern here.

Meanwhile, Egg's love interest Millicent has been sent home by her villainous father, who's bent on killing Egg (and any number of other people). Thus begins a barrage of perils for our heroes, who before the story ends have faced sea battles, weapon-wielding miscreants, slave traders, and an erupting volcano, as well as much character-building conflict.
","Embellished with fearsome pirates, buried treasure, slave traders, poignant romance and forays to exotic locales, this book winds up the saga with sweetness, panache, and severed limbs. Egg's earnest, comically deadpan narrative voice adds much to the story's appeal, as he grapples with challenges large and small, dodging death one minute and plunged into romantic angst as Millicent takes up with the handsome Cyril.
One peril gives way to another in the fast-moving plot as Egg seeks to avenge his father's death, win Millicent's heart, stand by his friends, evade all the people trying to kill him, and be worthy of the large amount of money it cost Burn Healy to free him from danger in Book 2.","Parents need to know that Blue Sea Burning, the conclusion of Geoff Rodkey's Chronicles of Egg series, continues 13-year-old Egg Masterson's exciting, tragicomic adventures in a fictional world replete with pirates who spend much of their time drinking, gambling, fighting, looting, and hacking off one another's limbs.

But when she's kidnapped by Conn McCrae, a member of the Interdimensional Bureau of Investigation, she discovers an alternate Chicago inhabited by Shades, a race of mysterious beings with powers that border on the magical. While searching for a way home, she attains new abilities and memories that threaten everything she cares about.
","THE SHADOW SOCIETY is a cleverly constructed alternate-world fantasy set in two versions of Chicago. Darcy Jones is an intriguing protagonist -- clearly traumatized by her abandonment but engaged in building a better life for herself with grit and good humor. Her interactions with her friends at school especially ring true. Unfortunately, Darcy's fascination with Conn McCrae, the mysterious boy who essentially ends up kidnapping her, feels forced. Readers may wonder why he's worth so much attention after Darcy discovers a whole other universe and a new set of powers for herself.","Parents need to know that The Shadow Society is a cleverly conceived alternate-world fantasy.

Pride and Prejudice and Zombies,"Zombies invade classic comedy of manners for laughs, groans.","The Bennet girls -- Elizabeth and her four sisters -- are looking for love against the stacked odds of no inheritance in a small British 19th century town. But in the meantime, they need to do a little zombie slaying to handle an infestation of unmentionables who've descended on their sleepy borough after a plague. Along the way, they navigate class, wealth, gender, social customs, courtship, and the usual human folly, plus a whole lot of zombies. And some ninjas.
","To appreciate this tale, you should probably enjoy Jane Austen's classic Pride and Prejudice and have a healthy affection for zombie gore, which has littered the TV and film landscape of late. Together, these strange bedfellows present a curiously entertaining spectacle of a gentle, good-mannered comedy about human folly right next to descriptions of the particular taste of a Japanese heart. It's at times odd, sometimes unsettling, occasionally funny, but strangely more seamless than you'd imagine.
For teens who are voracious readers of classics and contemporary works such as graphic novels, this imaginative exercise in mash-up can shake up their ideas about art and creativity outside the typical English class curriculum. For kids who might need a reason to be nudged in the directions of classics for a second look, this could be a fruitful path. For parents, this version of the story, unlike most mainstream zombie fare, introduces opportunities for discussions of history, gender, class, and mores, all through a strong female heroine. And hey -- it's 80 percent rooted in greatness.","Parents need to know that Pride and Prejudice and Zombies is a mash-up of Jane Austen's classic novel Pride and Prejudice with the addition of zombies, gore, and horror, including graphic descriptions of beheadings, the eating of organs, decapitations, and countless zombie killings.

The book's roughly 80 percent original text drawn from Austen's comedy of manners, and 20 percent horror-themed monster plot woven throughout. It's best approached as a satire or very tongue-in-cheek revision of one of the greatest novels of all time, and no substitute for the original.

"A Boy, a Mouse, and a Spider: The Story of E.B. White","Gentle bio of ""Charlotte's Web"" author is full of charm.","A BOY, A MOUSE, AND A SPIDER: THE STORY OF E.B. WHITE traces the journey shy Elwyn White takes to become much-loved author E.B. White. When young, Elwyn befriended a mouse and felt most at home with the animals in the barn. Though he didn't like kindergarten, he loved observing his animal friends and the natural world, and enjoyed writing down his thoughts about them. In college, he edited the school newspaper and began making up tales about a little mouse named Stuart. Though he moved to New York City and got a job writing at the prestigious magazine The New Yorker, he missed the countryside and moved his family to Maine. There, he continued to write and observe, turning his mouse stories into Stuart Little, and his barn friends into the characters in Charlotte's Web.
","This gentle biography of beloved children's book author E.B. White reads more like a sweet story than dry reportage nd drives home the message that shy, observant kids can grow up to create great art. In A Boy, a Mouse, and a Spider: The Story of E.B. White, author Barbara Herkert takes a subtle approach and never bombards readers with facts; those can be found in the three-page author's note at back. Her text also has quiet echoes of E.B. White's style. Where White used lists to evoke the sensory pleasures of a barn -- ""the nearness of rats, the sameness of sheep, the love of spiders, the smell of manure ..."" -- Herkert inserts similar lists throughout, such as ""the ripe scent of manure, the creak of harness leather, the perfect shape of eggs, the snort of tired horses ...""
Lauren Castillo's textured illustrations echo the homespun warmth of the original art of Garth Williams (Charlotte's Web, Stuart Little). Though here, instead of seeing young Fern in the barn visiting her animal friends, she sets Elwyn on the three-legged stool, underscoring the point that White had many of the same experiences he later gave his characters. The text and art together feel hushed, celebrating life's quiet spaces. And since the book directly poses the question ""I wonder what I might be?"" kids can be inspired when Elwyn realizes: ""Writing filled him with joy. This is where I belong.""","Parents need to know that A Boy, a Mouse, and a Spider: The Story of E.B. White, by Barbara Herkert, is a picture book biography worthy of its esteemed subject, E.B. White, who wrote Charlotte's Web and other classics. Illustrator Lauren Castillo won a Caldecott Honor for her book Nana in the City, and author Herkert has written other biographies for young readers, including one about artist Mary Cassatt. She includes a three-page author's note to provide more information. Kids don't have to be familiar with E.B. White's books to enjoy this one, since it can work more generally as a thoughtful tale of how a young, observant boy grew up to be a writer. But one fun activity -- pleasurable for parents and kids alike -- would be to pair this bio with nightly chapter-by-chapter read-alouds of Charlotte's Web and Stuart Little.

"The Orphan Army: The Nightsiders, Book 1",Exciting alien-invasion thriller mixes sci-fi and magic.,"For 11-year-old Milo Silk, normal life ended when the alien Swarm invaded Earth when he was 6. Now he's plagued by cryptic dreams, his father is missing and presumed dead, and his mother is off on a dangerous mission. Meanwhile, Milo slogs through the bayous with a group of other young refugees. As he and his friends battle for their very survival, Milo realizes they may have a set of unexpected allies in THE NIGHTSIDERS, magical creatures who also fight against the Swarm.
","It's hard to find a fresh angle on the alien-invasion story, but veteran horror author Jonathan Maberry succeeds by adding an unusual supernatural element to the plot. Aimed at middle-grade readers, his new novel is fast-paced and action-packed, with a likable main character, a diverse supporting cast, and a formidable villain.
Sometimes the story feels a little out of balance, as Maberry piles on one incredible revelation after another. It's clear, however, that there will be further installments in this saga, and readers who enjoy science fiction mixed with magic will be ready and waiting for more.","Parents need to know that The Orphan Army is the first volume in a science-fiction trilogy. Set in the bayous of Louisiana after Earth has been invaded by the Dissoterin (aka the Swarm), the story follows 11-year-old Milo Silk as he struggles to save himself, his friends, and what's left of his family from merciless, insect-like extraterrestrials. Milo has strange dreams about the future, but he isn't ready at first to accept that a group of shape-shifting individuals might be able to wield magical powers and aid him in his quest for sanctuary. Milo and his friends and allies are in almost constant danger, and The Orphan Army does have its fair share of violent scenes. But the characters suffer very little permanent damage, and much of the mayhem happens off-page. A teen is shocked by a stun gun. Milo undergoes something like a near-death, out-of-body experience. A wolf attacks various members of the Swarm in aid to Milo and his crew. There's mild romantic interest between two characters.

","This suspenseful and emotional tale thoughtfully tackles tough topics including the Philippines' drug war, addiction, and recovery, while emphasizing the power of family, friendship, and forgiveness. There aren't many books that describe the drug war and its aftermath from a kid's perspective, but My Fate According to the Butterfly does n excellent job of explaining these issues in a kid-friendly way. Sab shares a poignant moment with her mom, who explains how addiction is a disease while reassuring her that a family member's relapse wasn't her fault.
Readers will love Sab and Pepper's supportive friendship as well as Nadine's passion and commitment to social justice issues.

Infinite Sky,"Compelling tale of first love, violent fractured family.","INFINITE SKY details the troubled actions of two teens and their father after their mother/his wife leaves the family. Thirteen-year-old Iris can't stand the excessive attentions of ""concerned"" friends and only feels comfortable in the company of a teen boy whose family of Irish travelers has temporarily settled in the vacant lot next to her family's farm. Iris's brother, Sam, falls in with some violent thugs, and he and the kids' father, Thomas, take their anger and frustrations out on the travelers. As Iris and her traveler boyfriend, Trick, grow closer, tensions mount between their families, and Iris ends up caught in the middle when everything explodes.
","C.J. Flood's debut novel, Infinite Sky, is an emotionally compelling story of first love and family tension. Iris' shy feelings about Trick are relatable and sweet, especially set against all the pain and violence in her life.
Flood's writing is long on details, and she perhaps overdoes it a bit, especially in the last quarter of the book, but the characters have lots of heart, and the story takes a refreshingly complex view of right and wrong.","Parents need to know that Infinite Sky is a young adult novel about teens coping after their mother leaves their father to see the world. Iris, 13, and her brother, Sam, 15, are bereft, and their father, Thomas, feels lost and inept when they act out. Thomas drinks excessively, as does Sam. Thomas also takes out his frustration on the Irish travelers who have settled in a lot adjacent to the family's farm; he and others are prejudiced against travelers and want them evicted. Tensions in the family, and between families, result in extreme violence, including fistfights and the use of a knife and a brick as weapons. Adults and teens smoke cigarettes and use some foul language (""s--t,"" ""f--k,"" ""crap,"" ""scrotum,"" ""dickhead,"" ""prick""). Teens kiss in the book; the very mild sexual activity is one of this novel's most innocent and endearing qualities.

Jabberwocky,Classic poem played out on the basketball court.,"\""The Jabberwocky\"" poem by Lewis Carroll, written in nonsense words, is re-imagined here as a story about a 14-fingered beast who takes his prowess onto the basketball court. The beast is figuratively \""slain\"" by a beamish boy who takes him on in a game of one-on-one.
","With broad strokes, bright colors, and words that shout from the page, the inner city summer comes alive in this reinvention of the Jabberwocky. When Alice first heard the Jabberwocky in Through the Looking Glass, she didn't know what to think. ""It seems very pretty ... but it's rather hard to understand!"" she commented. And, most readers would agree, even in this new modern version set on an inner city basketball court. But somehow, through the rhythms and with a little help from the illustrations, even the youngest reader will get it.
In this version, re-imagined by the award-winning talent of Christopher Myers, nonsense makes sense. Though the words don't always fit the story perfectly, the rhythms pull them through, and Lewis Carroll's poem takes on the personality of an energetic rap song. And the basketball court seems the perfect setting. The 14-fingered basketball player who dominates the courts as well as the entire playground is as scary a Jabberwock monster as could be imagined. And, after the ""beamish"" boy challenges, and beats, him, the neighborhood celebrates: CALLOOH! CALLAY! as the hero struts off ""chort[ling] in his joy.""","Parents need to know that this poem written by Lewis Carroll is given a new twist on the basketball court, but it still hovers somewhere between silly nonsense and pure rhythmic genius.

"Silence: The Queen of the Dead, Book 1",Paranormal adventure bogs down in details.,"In SILENCE, a strange encounter in a cemetery leaves high school student Emma with the ability to communicate with the dead. Soon she's able to see her departed father, but she also receives frantic messages regarding a ghostly child trapped within a perpetually burning building. As she learns to use magic, Emma grows ever closer to becoming a Necromancer, a state of affairs that might require one of her presumed allies to kill her.
","Silence has an interesting, suspenseful premise and an engaging cast of characters. Unfortunately, the narrative is a little talky, with characters frequently engaging in long, vague conversations about how Emma's powers are supposed to work. When it shows action and character development, Silence is effective, but it occasionally breaks its own spell with too much telling.","Parents need to know that Silence (the first book in the Queen of the Dead series) is an intense story of paranormal intrigue, featuring a protagonist who can communicate with the dead. There's a fair amount of profanity (""f--k,"" ""a--hole""), some violence, and a lot of supernatural action. Characters interact with various ghosts, some of whom died in horrible circumstances, and there's a harrowing sequence featuring a 4-year-old ghost still trapped in a burning building. One character's college-age brother shows up drunk at a party, but he's also under the influence of magic.

When Myrtle and her baby brother go outside to play, Frances sings mean songs about them, ambushes them, and scares them so much they decide to just stay indoors. Their parents bring in the kids' spunky Aunt Tizzy, just back from a safari in Africa, who, with her stories of bravery and some African masks, helps Myrtle fell strong enough to stand up to Frances. Myrtle asks Aunt Tizzy if she was scared of the lions in Africa, and Tizzy says when they roared, \""I told them to stop being rude, and if they continued, I'd simply roar back. ... Or sometimes,\"" she adds, \""I would just sing and dance until they were gone.\"" Myrtle tries both strategies and finds they work.
","MYRTLE does an excellent job of tackling the bullying issue at a little kid's level. The art is irresistible, from the soft pastel tones of Myrtle's world to the bright African dress and masks of Aunt Tizzy. It' not always easy for kids to articulate their emotions, especially fear, but this story helps draw them out in Myrtle, and should do the same for readers.","Parents need to know that this cute picture books about a little girl rat and the rat bully who moves in next door deals with the issue of bullying in terms a little kid can understand and relate to.

The Peculiar,Half-faery boy fights to save his sister in magical fantasy.,"In a vaguely Victorian/steampunk alternate world where the Industrial Revolution is infused with magic and science fiction, the faeries (trapped in the human world by a cosmic mishap) and humans coexist with great suspicion, and the children of human-faery unions, called changelings or THE PECULIAR, get the worst of it. Changeling Bartholomew Kettle spends most of his time keeping himself and his sister Hettie (who has tree branches for hair) out of sight, but when he looks from his attic room to see a mysterious lady talking to the Peculiar boy across the street and spiriting him away in a puff of feathers, he has a bad feeling and suspects he or Hettie might be next. Magical powers, strange machinery, and universe-altering plots come into play in the adventures that follow, along with unlikely friendships and insights into those who aren't what they seem.
","Still in his teens as The Peculiar hits shelves, author Bachmann creates a compelling world, appealing characters, lurking humor, and a convoluted plot with a steady stream of revelations. Some readers may bog down in the descriptions and world-building, while others will revel in the detail. The book closes with a dramatic cliffhanger, but there's a sequel in the works.","Parents need to know that The Peculiar, by first-time author Stefan Bachmann -- a teen -- conjures up a scary, compelling alternate world in which kids with the wrong genes (known as changelings) are frequently murdered, and adults use magic, treachery, and physical violence to get their way. The weird imagery and violence may be too intense for some young readers: There's a bloody battle between humans and faeries (folkloric beings sometimes spelled ""fairies""); faeries and humans regularly kill changeling children, some who are found with their entrails mysteriously missing; and some other people die. But the characters are memorable, the vision is imaginative, and there are strong messages of friendship, family, loyalty, and protecting your loved ones even when it means risking your life.

"Front Lines: Front Lines, Book 1","Inventive, intense war story best for more mature teens.","It's 1942: The United States is at war, and women have only recently joined the American fighting force. Farm girl Rio, whose sister is killed in the war, enlists mostly to accompany her boy-crazy friend Jenou, who wants to leave her dysfunctional family and sleepy town behind. African-American Frangie wants to help her family and work toward her goal of becoming a doctor. Jewish New Yorker Rainy wants to take on the Nazis, whom she fears are the reason her family no longer hears from their European relatives. None of these girls expected to be in combat, but they all end up in the same horrific mess in Tunisia. This is their proving ground, where they're going to find out just how fiercely they can fight.
","This graphic, gripping imagining of WWII with women on the front lines doesn't skimp on the ugliness of war. It's also candid in its portrayal of an America still unwilling to include women or African-Americans in its big ideas about social justice. FRONT LINES is a long, sprawling saga with three minimally interwoven narratives, but it moves quickly and cleanly from one character to the next. The shifting perspectives offer a realistic picture of what soldiers and their families endured, and the strong language, gruesome violence, and chilling racism and sexism add to the realism.
Author Michael Grant presents three distinct, fully realized female characters, each with her own challenges, strengths, hopes, and fears. The inconveniences, smirking skepticism, and bold hostility they face may be eye-opening for modern teens, providing insight into the experiences of trailblazers. Published amid national debate over extending the U.S. draft to women, this offers plenty to ponder regarding war, duty, sacrifice, and humanity.","Parents need to know that Front Lines is a gritty work of alternate history, imagining World War II with women in combat roles. In telling the stories of three very different teen girls, author Michael Grant squarely confronts the vulgar truths of the times: Racism, profanity, sexual violence, and wartime horrors are presented bluntly and abundantly, and the result is an immersive, empathetic reading experience. Privates and officers use coarse, offensive language (though Grant sometimes substitutes tweaked spellings, such as ""fug"" and ""Nigra""). Female soldiers are still a new presence in the military, and they're subjected to lewd comments and misogynistic treatment by their male colleagues and many officers. Aside from that, however, they experience the war just as the boys and men do: They're inspired, vengeful, terrified, smart-alecky, regretful, and worried. This is the first book in a series.

Nanny McPhee: The Collected Tales of Nurse Matilda,Tiresome tales of misbehaving kids.,"Printed to accompany the movie, Nanny McPhee, this edition is a compilation of the ""Nurse Matilda"" stories, upon which the movie was (very loosely) based. In one volume it contains the books Nurse Matilda, Nurse Matilda Goes to Town, and Nurse Matilda Goes to Hospital.
\
","There's a reason this had gone out of print, until being resurrected by the related movie -- it wasn't very good. The Nurse Matilda stories are so unbelievably formulaic that even kids who get a giggle out of creative misbehavior may get as sick of it when it is endlessly repeated. The author deliberately makes the characters interchangeable so the reader never knows, or cares, who is who among the kids. Even Nurse Matilda has no personality -- she just grows prettier or uglier depending on the kids' behavior.
Just as the kids in this story respect no one, it seems the author doesn't either. There are only three types of characters: nasty children, oafish adults, and Nurse Matilda, the punisher, from whom the children learn nothing. Add wicked, selfish behavior played for laughs in with the xenophobia and mild racism characteristic of British children's books of the period and you get a book that may make your kids laugh -- but you'll wish it didn't.","Parents need to know that bad behavior is the theme and source of entertainment here, and no one learns their lesson. All the adults, except Nurse Matilda, are idiots and are the constant butt of the kid's pranks. Bad behavior by children is considered the norm.

Late in the book, Matt has a crisis of conscience, but doesn't really stand up to his friends about his conflicted feelings.

","This could've been a good coming-of-age story if the focus had shifted from the challenge of seeing a naked girl to Matt's challenge of swimming the butterfly much sooner in the story. As it stands, it seems that Matt's focus changes because he suddenly finds himself with a girlfriend (a nice girl that he hung out with but never even thought of in that way until she finally gave him the ""I like you like you"" talk and kissed him). Some kids might find the main characters' antics and failures funny; however, there is no realization on the part of the boys that girls are actually people with feelings and not just bodies to look at or things to make out with.","Parents need to know that the focus of this coming-of-age novel is the main characters' goal to see a naked woman in real life, without the woman's knowledge.

The poems, about ""Bad King John"" and ""The King of Peru"" and ""The Knight Whose Armor Didn't Squeak,"" are some of the cleverest and wittiest poetry ever written for children. And all of it is perfectly matched in tone by Ernest Shepard's delicate line drawings. This edition combines all four books into one volume, which is fine for reading aloud but too heavy and bulky for small hands to handle on their own for long.
For generations, A.A. Milne's four Pooh books -- two of prose stories, and two of poetry -- were the delight of children and adults, a treasure of English literature. The kindly wisdom depicted in the peaceful adventures of Pooh, Piglet, Rabbit, Eeyore, and others, all overseen by the wise and thoughtful Christopher Robin, tickled the fancies and warmed the hearts of millions.","Parents need to know that  this is very different from the garish, noisy, and commercialized Disney versions of Pooh stories, and that the reading and language levels are much higher than the Disney cartoons might indicate.

All of the Above,"Kids build a big tetrahedron, lasting friendships.","A frustrated math teacher stumbles on an idea to engage his students: build the world's biggest tetrahedron. After initial resistance, several students show up to the first meeting. Those that stick around forge unlikely friendships that change not only their thoughts about themselves but the community's thoughts about the run-down school they attend.
","This quick read will appeal to all kinds of students, whether they love, hate, or are indifferent about math. It will even appeal to budding chefs because barbeque recipes from a restaurant owned by Marcel's father are peppered throughout the book. Come for the math, stay for the BBQ? A strange combination, but somehow this story sticks together just fine, and sticks to your ribs.
This novel based on a true story starts off like many that focus on urban school systems: the students don't care, the teachers are uninspired, and the community is apathetic. Pearsall is a veteran author and she makes ALL OF THE ABOVE transcend the typical ""teacher-inspired miracle story."" Indeed, the math teacher at the center of the project, Mr. Collins, is a peripheral character. The four students who truly commit to the project -- Rhondell, Sharice, Marcel, and James -- drive the story with short, first-person chapters. The narratives show readers what motivates the four to participate in the project. We learn about their families, their dreams, and how the students are connected to each other.
 ","Parents need to know that this is a great book for reluctant readers. While there are some instances of bullying and child neglect, the overall message is a positive one.

Neighborhood Girls,Interesting but uneven look at the power of cliques.,"After her police officer father is convicted of abusing and torturing suspects, Wendy and her family lose everything and are considered pariahs in their working-class Chicago neighborhood. Fearing for her safety and reputation, Wendy works her way into the clique of popular, tough girls at her all-girls Catholic school. The plan mostly works, but she ends up paying a high price in terms of her conscience nd her old friendships. Her mom works constantly, trying to dig the family out of debt, and her brother joined the Navy and is stationed abroad. Unsupervised and adrift, Wendy makes some bad decisions and faces some dangerous situations. Her new group of friends offers a good level of protection, but they also bring their own host of problems. Wendy's left on her own to work out her feelings about her dad's crimes, whether she can stand up to her group of friends when they do illegal and unethical things, and her guilt over having abandoned her childhood friend Alexis.
","This sometimes engaging but mostly uneven story of a girl seeking protection among the cool kids shines a light on the power of high school cliques and female friendships. Author Jessie Ann Foley writes Neighborhood Girls from Wendy's point of view, and she does an excellent job of showing the push and pull of Wendy's conscience s she struggles with her friends' lack of ethics and lack of intellectual depth. The downside is that it get increasingly frustrating to read about Wendy's inaction and her friends' behavior. Kenzie, the leader of the clique, is unbearable at times, and the story veers into bleak territory here and there. Also, side stories and too much detail on interactions not all that important to the story make the book longer than it needs to be. Foley tried to cram in too much, and the narrative suffers as a result.
The writing is beautiful and wonderfully descriptive in spots, and Foley highlights the dilemma families face when a loved one has done something terrible. It's intriguing to contemplate how a family could reconcile the person they knew to be good and loving with the sadistic abuser who could do such things (in this case abuse and torture suspects), sometimes to teens.","Parents need to know that Neighborhood Girls, by Jessie Ann Foley (The Carnival at Bray), follows the internal and external struggles of a teen girl whose life has been turned upside down after her father's arrest. Fearing she has a target on her back because of her father's brutal crimes (he was a police officer who abused and tortured suspects), Wendy decides to get in with a popular, powerful clique. Kids steal, go to parties, get drunk, flirt, have sex, bully, and break school rules. Characters swear, including ""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""bitch,"" and ""a--hole."" The story offers some good discussion ideas around ethics, when to stand up to friends, communication between parents and kids, and bullying.

Blood Water Paint,Teen artist fights rapist in riveting tale of 1610 Rome.,"As the events of BLOOD WATER PAINT unfold in verse, it's Rome in 1610, and motherless 17-year-old Artemisia Gentileschi does a lot of disgusting work for her talentless artist father, from scraping boiled rabbit skins to exposing assorted body parts when he needs a female model. Unbeknownst to his customers, she also does most of the skilled work on his paintings. Then one day one of her father's colleagues rapes her in her own house, and she has to decide whether to keep silent or seek justice. Guiding her thoughts are the biblical heroines Judith and Susanna, whose tales are retold by Artemisia's late mother in flashback.
","This riveting story of 17th-century Rome spins, mostly in verse, a powerful tale of a young girl who, inspired by biblical heroines, stands up against her male abusers. In Blood Water Paint, first-time novelist Joy McCullough reveals a strong, complex, appealing character in Artemisia, whose sense of rightness won't allow her to meekly accept victimhood.

Protagonist Artemisia Gentileschi, 17 at the time of the story, narrates her story and feelings in verse, interrupted occasionally by prose flashbacks in which Artemisia's mother, long dead, arms her against a bad world by telling her the lurid but empowering Bible stories of Judith and Susanna. The novel includes sexual and violent content, usually conveyed more by suggestion than by explicit description, but there are also strong messages of courage, self-respect, overcoming obstacles, and doing what's right.

Janis Joplin: Rise Up Singing,Award-winning bio of bigger-than-life blues singer.,"Janis Joplin began life as a shy little girl from a small town in Texas. She rebelled as a teenager, rose to rock stardom in the '60s, and died at 27, alone in a hotel room, of a heroin and alcohol overdose. Within the psychedelic covers of this biographical book, readers will find page after page of \ engaging and factual text scattered with poignant photographs that tell the whole story of this amazing blues singer. In some ways, her life was quite ordinary; she yearned for love, family, etc. But she was also a bigger-than-life star who rode the crest of the wave during the rock and roll revolution that also took the likes of Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison. Funky scrolls decorate the margins much like they did the posters of the' 60s, and a timeline and references at the end add more context.
","This biography not only traces the rise and fall of rock star Janis Joplin, but also gives a sensitive, though not overly sentimental, portrait of her personal life. The reader will understand why it won the 2011 YALSA Award for Excellence in Nonfiction for Young Adults. The reader is left with a real feeling for what life must have been like for her as she tried to break out of the mold, the highs and the lows, the fun, the joy, and the tragedy. In a story taken primarily from interviews with friends and family, as well as their letters to and from Joplin, this biography is well-documented, clearly-written, and meaty enough without being heavy-handed or too sentimental.","Parents need to know that this award-winning biography of one of the most influential female rock stars of the '60s was based on letters and interviews with family and friends of Janis Joplin, as well as previous articles written about her. Drug experimentation and addiction are definitely part of the story, but they are neither glorified nor sentimentalized, and are definitely not the book's focus. What is emphasized here are the very human struggles of a young girl trying to break out of the constraints of living in Texas in the very traditional '50s, how she found her voice, and the toll her struggles took on her life. There are also mentions of sex and there's some occasional profanity.

The Lincolns: A Scrapbook Look at Abraham and Mary,The way biographies for children ought to be done.,"This dual biography of President Abraham Lincoln and his wife Mary begins with their parents and early lives, and continues through Abraham's death, ending with Mary's. Using a large-format scrapbook form, with loads of photos from the period, pictures of archival documents, clips of speeches, political cartoons, newspaper headlines, boxes with information about the period and the war, jokes, anecdotes, and pungent details, it builds a picture of the life and times of our sixteenth president. Includes bibliography, author's research notes, extensive end notes, and index.
","This is the way biography for children ought to be done. The content is deep, rich, complex, and emotional, and the author shows great respect for the intelligence of her young readers. The scrapbook format, with the information given in snippets of no more than a page or so, loaded with pictures, and with light and dark intermingled, ensures that it never becomes overwhelming. Yet these bits and pieces somehow build in intensity and emotional power, and readers will come away from this with a clear-eyed, unromanticized, yet deeply empathetic view of the president, his much-maligned wife, and the terrible times, both public and private, through which they lived.
	The book is not without its flaws, chiefly the poor reproductions of too many of the pictures -- they are simply too small and too dark to see much in some of them. The reproductions of period maps are all well and good, but the reader might long for some large, clear, modern ones to help make sense of some of the information, especially about the war. But overall, this is a brilliant book, told in a style that will grab readers' interest and educate both their minds and hearts about one of our greatest presidents and the terrible war he presided over.
 From the Book:
	From the moment she said ""I do, "" Mary set out to smooth Abraham's coarse country manners. She railed against her husband's habit of eating peas with his butter knife. She scolded when he chewed with his mouth open. And she raised ""merry hell,"" said one neighbor, when he sat down to supper in his shirtsleeves. Once, he answered the door wearing his holey carpet slippers -- the pair that exposed a big, bony toe. When the refined ladies on the front step finally recovered from their shock, the asked for his wife. Lincoln, in his homespun fashion, replied that ""he'd trot the woman out"" immediately. This complete breach of manners so enraged Mary, she gave him a tongue-lashing right there in front of the guests.","Parents need to know that this book gives details of the most brutal and horrific war this country has fought.

A Hero for WondLa,Heroine's humanity anchors stronger sequel.,"Eva Nine, raised in an underground home by a robotic mother, is rescued by the first fellow human she's ever met -- a young pilot named Hailey. He takes her to New Attica, a hidden human city led by Cadmus Pryde, who spearheaded the Human Repopulation Project. Eva is at first enthralled by the high-tech city and its hip citizens, but her growing unease turns to alarm as she discovers just how completely Cadmus controls the human population -- and why. With help from a newfound sister, Eva learns that her friend Rovender and other aliens are suffering through cruel experiments ordered by Cadmus. She frees them and flees the city, with Cadmus and his war machines in pursuit, in a desperate attempt to warn the aliens of Orbona to prepare for battle.
","In this second installment of the WondLa trilogy, author Tony DiTerlizzi dials up the action and adds rich layers of complexity to his futuristic fantasy. Questions about family and friendship take center stage, and the relationship between human Eva and alien Rovender keeps the fantasy grounded.
As in The Search for WondLa, Terlizzi's lovely illustrations do most of the heavy lifting in portraying the curious world of Orbona.

Jazz Age Josephine,"Jazzy bio of Josephine Baker inspiring, bittersweet.","Young Josephine is born in 1906 in St. Louis and grows up very poor, ""singin' nothin' but the blues."" When kids are cruel to her, she makes funny faces with her eyes bugging out or crossed. She is a great dancer and figures out she can get paid for dancing and pretending to be a fool. After whites burn down her black neighborhood, she leaves and joins a traveling show that takes her all over the United States. She makes her Broadway debut at 15, but, like other African-American performers in that era, is forced to wear black face makeup to exaggerate her features for comic effect. ""Each night she wore those baggy pants, / she wore what people called 'blackface.' / As much as all those white folks loved her, / it was an insult to her race."" In 1925, at age 19, she heads to Paris, where she finds fame and fortune, dancing, singing, and making funny faces -- finally treated with the kind of respect she could never attain in the U.S., where, as the Author's Note explains, ""she had been offered only humiliating roles.""
","JAZZ AGE JOSEPHINE is an exciting picture book biography of one of the world's most beloved entertainers of her time. Winter's jazzy rhyming verse and two-time Caldecott Honoree Marjorie Priceman's bold, exuberant illustrations capture the deprivation of Josephine's childhood, the triumph of her performing career, and the glitz and glamor of the 1920s, known as the Jazz Age. Baker playfully dances across the pages, contorting her body into animal poses and kicking her long legs with abandon. It's a vivid portrayal that conveys Baker's irrepressible energy, as well as her melancholy at not being able to return to the land of her birth, lest she face prejudice and discrimination. ","Parents need to know that this fun picture-book biography treats the very serious subject of racism in America in the early part of the 20th century.

I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,Poetic autobiography reveals impact of racial prejudice.,"I KNOW WHY THE CAGED BIRD SINGS is the first volume in poet Maya Angelou's autobiography. In this book, Marguerite (nicknamed Maya) and her brother, Bailey Jr., are sent to Stamps, AK, to live with their grandmother around 1934 when they are 6 and 8 years old, respectively. In Stamps, they're raised with love by their strict, stoic, religious grandmother (Momma) and their disabled uncle Willie. Though Momma owns the black area of Stamps' only general store and is somewhat wealthy by local standards, the children suffer the same cruel racial bigotry as any black people in that place at that time. As the book progresses, the siblings are shuttled between Stamps, St. Louis, MO (where their mother and her family live for a time), and San Francisco (where their mother eventually settles). Along the way, Maya's life and self-image are shaped as much by the terrific mentors in her life and the love of family members as it is by the shocking racial prejudice in her world or by her traumatic rape as a child.
","Angelou's autobiography is n important and honest look at racial prejudice in the United States during the 1930s and '40s, but it's also as compelling and lyrical as a great novel.

Reading Dunbar's poem may offer further insight into this book. Nominated for a National Book Award, this autobiographical work is strong, honest, and beautifully written, but it details some very upsetting personal incidents, including the rape of a very young girl, shocking racial prejudice, and gritty urban life, so it may be too disturbing for preteens.

She sees her new stepsiblings and stepmother as the ones who stole her father from her so, despite their initial friendliness, she is determined to be cool to them.

Flipped,Honest story about first crushes -- tweens and up.,"In alternating chapters, Bryce and Juli tell the story of their relationship, beginning in second grade when Bryce moves in across the street from Juli. Juli instantly develops a crush on Bryce, who does not reciprocate, and throughout elementary school he tries to avoid her persistent and unwelcome attentions.
In middle school, however, they both begin to notice Bryce's substantial character flaws. Just as Bryce begins to try to change, and to notice Juli's good points, her ardor starts to cool. Meanwhile their families, and their perceptions of their world, also undergo dramatic changes.
","This deceptively simple novel about first crushes is a lot like real life -- sometimes too much so. There is hardly a character, major or minor, adult or child, who is really likable, though a few, such as Bryce and his grandfather, drift toward likability by the end. They all mess up, usually repeatedly, and mostly through selfishness and lack of understanding and compassion, just like real people. And most of them change -- and change again.
The alternating narrators device in FLIPPED adds another realistic layer to this multilayered book. Bryce and Juli describe the same events from their points of view, and they do so with surprising honesty. The differences in their versions come not from trying to hide the truth or justify their own behavior, but from genuinely seeing things differently. They both behave badly, Bryce especially, but they're both able to face that and to attempt the always difficult process of conscious change.","Parents need to know that nearly every character, major and minor, adult and child, behaves badly. In some cases they learn better or regret their mistakes; in others (such as the main characters cheating in school) they don't. Because of the romantic subject matter, it will probably appeal mainly to middle schoolers.

Her grandmother is a lonely little girl, locked SEVEN STORIES UP in the hotel and mostly ignored by her family because she's sickly. Annie befriends her, and the two go on adventures all over Baltimore, including to a fair; there Annie meets a fortune teller who tells her, ""Now and then a thing needs to happen so badly the universe decides to rearrange itself."" But what will happen to Annie as she starts to change her grandmother's fate? Can she ever get back to her own time?
","Seven Stories Up is simple and sweet; history-loving readers will enjoy traveling back in time with kind-hearted Annie and learning about the Depression. Some of the plot points -- such as Molly's maid being completely unconcerned about her charge running around with a stranger -- don't quite seem credible. Even so, the story may move parents to share their own family stories and have fun conversations about how much life has changed. ","Parents need to know that Seven Stories Up is a time-travel book with some historical details about the Depression. Characters Annie and Molly don't always act like angels (Molly gets in a skating accident and breaks a bunch of lamps in a store; Annie teaches some girls the ""Miss Lucy"" hand-clapping game, which includes some suggestive language), but their hearts are in the right place. Annie in particular works to teach Molly to be a kinder person. Two adult characters talk about going to take a smoke. A few products (Lucky Charms, SpaghettiOs) are mentioned.

Twenty Yawns,"Cozy, colorful bedtime tale helps kids count.","In TWENTY YAWNS, Lucy's at the beach with her family. She and her parents spend the day playing -- reading under umbrellas, digging in the sand, flying a kite, taking a beach walk. At the end of the long, full day, the mom declares, ""Early bedtime!"" and then falls asleep reading Lucy her bedtime story, as does the dad. Lucy feels wide awake in the mysterious moonlight and can't fall asleep -- until she fetches her many stuffed animals and tucks them into bed. With one last yawn, she drifts to sleep herself.
","This bedtime book by novelist Jane Smiley, illustrated with warm-and-fuzzy coziness by picture-book pro Lauren Castillo, has a simple, time-tested story. At bedtime, everything looks spooky in the moonlight, so Lucy can't fall asleep, but she's able to do so when she snuggles with her stuffed animals. Illustrator Castillo gives readers lots to enjoy visually, wordlessly picturing a multiracial family not referenced in the text, painting the girl and family with warmth and appeal, and having fun with the details -- for instance, the pictures of family members mentioned in the text aren't photos but kid-drawn pictures taped up on the wall, as a family might do in a temporary beach rental.
This is also a counting book, with the 20 yawns in the title sprinkled throughout. Because each yawn is accompanied by the word in color and different type, they're easy to find, and if 20 objects is too many for the target preschool-age readers to count (and not just rattle off by rote), parents and kids can simply try to hunt for them.","Parents need to know that Twenty Yawns pairs Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Jane Smiley with Caldecott Honor-winning illustrator Lauren Castillo (Nana in the City) for a warm and fuzzy bedtime book. After a long day at the beach, Lucy's mom falls asleep reading a bedtime story, and Lucy feels uneasy awake and alone in the moonlight, but when she gathers her stuffed animals she's able to fall asleep. Castillo supplies the picture-book know-how, wordlessly presenting a biracial family and evoking the spookiness of moonlight with art that's brightly colorful and child-pleasing. As an educational bonus, kids can count the 20 yawns of the title. Good book to foster discussion about fear of the dark or to pair with a trip to the beach.

"Babymouse Tales from the Locker:  Lights, Camera, Middle School!","Series moves to middle school, tackles fear with humor.","In BABYMOUSE TALES FROM THE LOCKER: LIGHTS, CAMERA, MIDDLE SCHOOL!, the popular elementary school series star takes a big step forward into middle school. Big changes can be scary, and middle school can be hard to figure out. As if that's not enough, pile on tons of homework, boring algebra, and big changes in friendships, too. Babymouse thinks fame is the answer to her problems, and signs up for the school's film club. But when the teacher makes her the director of their big movie, Babymouse finds out there's a lot more to making movies and being famous than she bargained for.
","The popular elementary school series takes a big step forward as the funny, engaging mouse of the title moves up and into the big, scary world of middle school. Babymouse Tales from the Locker: Lights, Camera, Middle School! grows up a little bit, too. Babymouse's signature pink is gone from the illustrations, which are all in black-and-white. There's more text, too, although it's still heavy on the lively, graphic novel-type drawings that make it a good choice for reluctant readers.
Babymouse sometimes makes mistakes as she faces the newer, bigger challenges of middle school. But she learns from them, turning her monster-movie life into a hilarious comedy. Fans of the original series will enjoy  the plucky way Babymouse faces a brave new world. Readers new to the series will like the way the funny, relatable mouse tries to figure out middle school.","Parents need to know that Babymouse Tales from the Locker:  Lights, Camera, Middle School! moves the popular Babymouse franchise up from grade school.

There's some mild scariness in the drawings of dark hallways populated with monsters and zombies, and in a fantasy, a giant tentacle reaches out from Babymouse's locker and grabs her. Babymouse learns the importance of teamwork, and of not taking yourself too seriously. She also learns from her mistakes and provides a great example of a proper apology. Tween characters acting in a movie kiss over two comic book-style panels. A fictional website mentioned, superfamouspeople.com, leads to a GoDaddy page offering to sell the domain name, but the book doesn't encourage kids to go to the site at all.

White Lines,Edgy tale of teen in '80s club scene shows graphic drug use.,"After being removed from the home of her abusive and manipulative mother, 17-year-old Cat moves into her own Manhattan apartment, paid for by a wealthy and distant father. Though Cat has few real friends and struggles in school, she's a fixture on the downtown club scene, promoting parties and going out nightly with an exclusive, hard-partying clientele. Her life affords her all the freedoms most teens dream of, but as she sinks deeper into drug addiction amid a fantastical nocturnal world, Cat's high school reality becomes defined by a growing feeling of isolation. Her constant self-medicating with drugs and partying to combat a lifetime of abuse and neglect only heighten her fragility, preventing her from gaining the tools she needs to heal and grow up. She knows she needs help. But can she stop before it's too late?
","Author Jennifer Banash does well with her first-person narration of a lonely and insecure teen girl, creating a character you can't help but feel for. She also paints a vivid picture of New York City, from the lavish wealth of Park Avenue to the singular beat of the downtown club scene. But the pacing of WHITE LINES is off; Cat's inner dialogue becomes deeply repetitive, and far too much time is spent on menial details. For instance, descriptions of characters' hair (the color of, the flow of, the way it flops on a forehead or is brushed from a shoulder) are found on nearly every other page, diluting their effect.
But despite the plodding narrative, Banash has crafted some interesting characters in Cat and the various colorful people who inhabit her circle. Cat's feelings of alienation and loneliness are endearing and relatable; the reader can't help but feel invested in her plight. And so the story becomes more engaging with every chapter leading up to the climactic ending.","Parents need to know that White Lines is a coming-of-age novel set in New York City in the late 1980s. It's narrated by deeply troubled teen Cat, who lives alone in Lower Manhattan, barely attends school, and goes out to clubs almost nightly until sunrise. She consistently uses alcohol and drugs, including cocaine, ecstasy, and on one accidental occasion, heroin. Despite having a supportive best friend and sweet high school crush, she fraternizes regularly with drug dealers, teen dropouts, and adults with questionable motives. And her daily self-medicating to mask the pain of an abusive childhood is catching up with her. Fast. Strong language (""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""bitch,"" ""hell,"" ""damn,"" and more) and drug slang are prevalent throughout. A character we don't meet attempts suicide by overdosing on Xanax. One mother drinks constantly and becomes abusive, and another mother is inferred to have a prescription pill habit. Cat recounts various incidents of physical abuse at the hand of her mother.

A Heart in a Body in the World,Emotional story of girl's journey after tragedy.,"In A HEART IN A BODY IN THE WORLD, the reader meets Annabelle as she's having a panic attack at a fast-food restaurant. Her solution is to start running east, resulting in a cross-country run from Seattle to Washington, D.C. As the story unfolds, we learn that a horrific tragedy lurks in her past, and she understandably is not dealing well with her guilt, anger, and deep grief. What exactly happened to her and her group of friends is kept a mystery throughout most of the book, unfolding in pieces as she runs, thinks, and confronts more of the memories that haunt her. Even though Annabelle starts her cross-country journey with no specific plan, her family and friends quickly rally around her, getting transportation, shelter, food, supplies, and eventually a PR strategy in place. As she challenges herself physically and mentally, she makes new bonds with the people she meets on her run and strengthens the bonds with those closest to her. Annabelle goes from running away from the tragedy to doing something about it and connecting with other survivors.
","This beautifully written story of a teen girl who decides to run across the country after a tragedy is an emotional look at teen violence, gender roles, and post-traumatic stress. Throughout A Heart in a Body in the World, author Deb Caletti manages a deft balancing act between Annabelle's pain and the uplifting trajectory of her physical and mental journey. The story is slow at the start and might be hard for some readers to get invested in right away, but it is worth sticking it out, as Annabelle's journey is thoroughly engaging. The supporting characters are wonderful and add a lot of humor and love to the story, which can be all too rare in YA. It takes quite a long time for the mysterious traumatic incident to be revealed, probably a little too long, and many of the metaphors are heavy handed (grizzlies lurking in the woods, a dark scary tunnel, a rickety bridge she needs to cross). Caletti doesn't start dropping concrete hints about what happened until well past the halfway point of the book. On the plus side, drawing it out is a way to bring the reader along with Annabelle as she forces herself to confront her memories, guilt, and anger. Trauma victims have a long road of recovery ahead of them, and this book makes that clear and heartfelt.
The run across the country isn't all terrible, though. Annabelle gathers an encouraging community of supporters as she goes, and she bonds with her hilarious and charming grandfather, who's following her and putting her up in his RV. Many complex issues are well articulated in the story, letting the reader feel deeply for Annabelle's struggles and cheer her triumphs.","Parents need to know that A Heart in a Body in the World by Deb Caletti (The Last Forever and Honey, Baby, Sweetheart) was named  2019 Printz Honor Book. It's bout a teen girl who's recovering from a personal tragedy and decides to run across the country as a way to work through her trauma. Throughout her grueling journey, she recalls bit by bit the events leading up to the tragedy and eventually the incident itself. The story tackles several important issues, including behavioral expectations placed on young women, red flags in relationships, violence by young men, and the long-term effects of PTSD. There's  graphic scene of violence told in flashback, plus some alcohol consumption. Swearing is infrequent, as is kissing and making out.

A Clatter of Jars,"Quirky blend of magic, issues, recipes in summer camp tale.","As the story opens, Cady, heroine of A Tangle of Knots, chooses not to use the unknown Talent stolen by her thieving grandfather but instead throws it, and the jar it's kept in, into Lake Atropos, home to a summer camp near Poughkeepsie, New York. This sets a series of fateful events in motion, and several years later, a group of campers, many with unique Talents and eventually revealed connections to the characters of Book 1, arrives at Camp Atropos for two weeks of fun. Little do they know the camp director has built a thriving business by stealing and selling the kids' Talents and that the magic's going to get pretty strange as it gets passed around. Many of the kids have issues of their own -- absent fathers, hated stepsisters, trying to be your own person (and have that person be someone you like) -- and do some terrible things: One girl caused the accident that broke her brother's leg but won't admit it; a boy forcibly submerges his brother, who's terrified of water, to get something for himself.  Meanwhile, down at the lake, there's A CLATTER OF JARS as the stolen Talents seem to take on a life of their own.
","A quirky, magical blend for some readers won't quite gel for others as author Lisa Graff piles tween issues and life lessons with Spanish verse, strange powers, and recipes for summer beverages. There also are lots of mysterious connections with the characters in A Tangle of Knots. There's a lot going on here, much of it showcasing the dire effects of misdeeds driven by jealousy, greed, and the like (including theft and violence). And while many of the issues (such as djusting to a new step-sibling) are highly relatable to the tween audience, the characters who personify these issues (and who, in other Graff books, such as Lost in the Sun, would have the whole book to themselves to work each one out) often remain pretty one-note and cartoonish.
Lots of readers will love the magical treatment of Talents (including silly ones) gone astray, but many will find this all a bit muddled and contrived.","Parents need to know that there's a lot of heavy stuff going on in Lisa Graff's sequel A Clatter of Jars -- broken families, blended families, sibling rivalry, jealousy, stealing, danger, and, in one awful scene, a character pushing his terrified brother underwater. The story marks a return to the magic-enhanced rustic New York of A Tangle of Knots nd involves some of the first book's characters, as well as the issues that arise when some people have magical Talents and others don't. Graff dispenses life lessons galore along the way, particularly about apologizing, forgiveness, and reconciliation, some of which may get a bit cloying and preachy. Like A Tangle of Knots, Clatter is part magical tale, part morality play in which the characters more or less personify their issues, and part cookbook -- in this case, a collection of delicious-sounding summer drinks -- with a Spanish verse that's so important to the story it gets repeated over a dozen times. This odd mix will be a hit with some readers but won't quite work for many others, and some kids will find the scary stuff too intense.

The Last Holiday Concert,The kids are in charge of the holiday concert.,"School choral director Mr. Meinert is about to be laid off because of budget cutbacks, his wife is pressuring him to get out of teaching altogether, and his students mostly hate chorus. One day he finally snaps, and, without thinking it through, tells his students that he is bowing out, and they are in charge of the holiday concert. They will be up on stage for half an hour in front of everyone, and he's having nothing more to do with it.
At first the students are stunned, then thrilled to do nothing during chorus period. But it dawns on them that if they don't do something they will look like fools at the concert. So they elect popular Hart Evans, who had shot Mr. Meinert with a rubber band in class just the day before, to be in charge, even though he doesn't want to do it. Now this socially talented boy and his soon-to-be-ex-teacher may have to look to each other to make a miracle out of this mess.
","Right now Andrew Clements is the king of the middle-grade novel, for four reasons. Nobody knows the ins and outs of elementary school life, and the workings of gifted students and teachers, as well as he does. Nobody writes endings so purely satisfying. Few are writing with this kind of depth and emotional complexity for this age group. And Clements is the leading, perhaps even the only, writer for kids of a genre one might call Realistic Fantasy (think ""The West Wing""), in which things happen not as they do in real life, but as they should.
Readers won't be able to put this book down, not because it is filled with action and suspense (it isn't), or to find out if the villain will win (there are no villains), but because it is, from beginning to end, so completely delightful, so satisfying, so right. It's the kind of book that makes the reader sigh happily after finishing it, then turn back to the beginning and read it again, just for the pleasure of it. It's a book that thousands of music teachers all over the country will be given as a holiday present by grateful students, a book that may inspire both teachers and students to new ideas and new understandings of each other. And, in a time when both movies and books seem to take delight in trashing the holidays and making fun of traditions, it's a book that will surely become a holiday classic because it does neither.","Parents need to know that, like all of Clements' books, this one can lead kids to examine aspects of their own school lives -- in this case, the natures of popularity and leadership, the roles of teachers and students in education, the workings of peer groups and school institutions, and what makes for a meaningful performance.

A Moment Comes,Moving coming-of-age story set amid creation of Pakistan.,"Three teenagers, Tariq (a Muslim), Anupreet (a Sikh), and Margaret (a British Christian) come together in northern India in the months before India gains independence from Britain and Pakistan is created. Margaret's father is helping draw the boundaries for the new Pakistan, and Tariq and Anupreet are hired as household servants to the British family. Tariq and Anupreet must wrestle with what will become of them and their families after Partition as all three struggle with the emotional complexities of growing up. Wary and unsure of the cultural differences that at first seem to separate them, those differences disappear when a brush with death brings them together to save Tariq.
","A MOMENT COMES deftly weaves together three different young lives on the verge of tremendous social and emotional change. Jennifer Bradbury's able writing conveys the crushing heartbreak of cyclical violence as finely as the intimacy with which she brings us into their hearts and minds. The different voices are realistic, and Bradbury moves us from one to the next seamlessly. The big-picture historical events and figures are easy to understand without feeling dumbed down and without diminishing their complexity, and a helpful glossary in the back keeps the Indian vocabulary accessible. The artful portraits of all three characters amid epic events will create a new level of understanding for readers turning their thoughts to the larger world around them. ","Parents need to know that A Moment Comes is a vivid historical novel that puts a heartbreaking, human face on the events surrounding the creation of Pakistan in 1947. It's a violent time when people, mobs especially, commit violent acts in an endless cycle; the violence isn't gory, but the tension of living with it constantly under the surface pervades the atmosphere. There's no sex, although women and girls as a sexual commodity are mentioned, as is the possibility of Margaret's past sexual relationship (we don't know exactly what happened other than that there was a scandal). The 16- and 17-year-old narrators engage in mildly flirtatious behavior. People smoke in a time when the dangerous health consequences were not widely known.

Ada Lovelace Cracks the Code,Inspiring bio of woman who published first computer code.,"ADA LOVELACE CRACKS THE CODE traces the early life and remarkable achievements of the person who, among other inventions and technological advances, published the first computer code. Born in 1815 into wealth and high social standing but abandoned by her famous poet father, young Ada Byron's education by private tutors was overseen by her demanding mother. Ada was fascinated by inventions nd created a flying machine and her own flying laboratory until measles made her bedridden and weak. When Ada was well enough, her mother took her on a tour of a fabric factory, where Ada first saw how automation could help labor-intensive processes. Ada pursued her ideas but was held back by a society that didn't see women as capable of inventing, publishing, or being serious contributors.
","Filled with examples of creativity sparked by small observations, this detailed look at the earliest days of modern computing is engaging, informative, and inspiring. Ada Lovelace Cracks the Code is packed with historical information about the kinds of innovation that were just starting to be considered in the early 1800s. Readers who've grown up with hand-held, lightning-fast computers will get an interesting view of the woman who started it all, and will come away with an appreciation of the social pressures she faced as a woman who insisted on using her brain in a time when that was not required.","Parents need to know that Ada Lovelace Cracks the Code, by Rebel Girls, is the inspiring history of the creator of the first published computer program in the early 1800s, and a reminder of how much more Ada could have achieved if the world had considered women equal to men. Readers see both sides of Ada's privileged but often lonely childhood, and can decide if her mother's ways of educating her helped or hindered Ava's accomplishments. The humble beginning of computing is interesting, especially for readers who've grown up with smartphones and ever advancing technology. At the end of the book, there are activities for young engineering minds. The punch card symbols or binary codes match to letters of the alphabet, and readers decipher the code to find the answer to jokes, and see how coding works at a most basic level.

We met Sophia, a Latina sixth-grader who loves sports, in the first book, and now she and her friends can't wait to participate in their first robot hackathon -- until a change of plans threatens to ruin everything. Will these friends be there for one another in the end, or will the day turn into a disaster?

","This is a sweet, fast read with a positive message about how to face challenges. Readers can identify with having a tween crush and balancing responsibilities at school with those at home. Sophia, called by her sixth grade friends ""the Queen of Organization,"" is the kind of kid who's passionate about different things in life, such as sports and computers.
The cast of characters here is diverse, but at times it feels forced, almost stereotypical.

The Last to Let Go,"Teen tries to hold family together in sad, beautiful story.","In THE LAST TO LET GO, author Amber Smith tackles the tough subject of domestic abuse and its effect on families. The story centers on Brooke, a high school junior, who is reeling from her dad's death at her mother's hands. Before the killing, Brooke's family was already fractured internally due to years of domestic violence, but after her dad's death, all the cracks are exposed and things start to come apart. With her siblings dealing with the trauma in their own ways and her mother in jail, Brooke works hard to hold herself and the family together. She starts her new academically rigorous high school, confronts her sexuality, and gets a job, all while trying to get through emotionally to her mom, sister, and brother. Eventually, it is all too much for a 16-year-old to manage, and Brooke must face the truth of her situation and how her family's past has shaped who she is.
","A teen girl struggles to keep her family together in this sad but engaging look at the ripple effects of domestic violence. The story has little plot and is slow in places, but author Amber Smith's beautiful, lyrical writing elevates The Last to Let Go above standard YA fare. Brooke Winters, the 16-year-old at the center of the story, is hard to get invested in as a character. Though her pain of being an outsider is well presented, she is so closed off from herself and others, it can make for frustrating reading. Her progression from self-absorbed to self-aware teen is an important part of the book, but it isn't always an enjoyable journey to follow. Along those lines, her mother never explains her decisions or her actions, only saying to Brooke things along the lines of ""You wouldn't understand."" The story would have been better served by showing more of the mom's perspective. Her actions greatly influence the story but the reader never gets to know her.
Smith effectively shows how difficult it is to help people in abusive relationships, the long-term effects of abuse, and how it can be handed down through generations. Each Winters sibling has a different response to and different personal issues resulting from living in an emotional war zone for so many years. The ending isn't tied up in a neat bow, but it is satisfying and realistic.","Parents need to know that The Last to Let Go is about a teen girl, Brooke, trying to hold herself and her family together after their mother kills their father. The story details the many ways domestic abuse affects people for the rest of their lives. Author Amber Smith (The Way I Used to Be) sets the aftermath of the killing against typical teen issues that become anything but typical given Brooke's situation. The story doesn't present the abuse graphically and mostly deals with the emotional trauma of abuse. Brooke navigates a new school, new friends nd romance, and her first job during the hardest time of her life. Characters drink and smoke a little, and swear infrequently (""s--t,"" ""f--k,"" and ""a--hole""). The book provides many good discussion points, including issues around domestic violence, honesty in relationships, and what makes a family.

She's always been seen as a beacon for people who come to America ""yearning to breathe free."" But Eggers as the unseen narrator speaking directly to the reader points out that many people haven't noticed that she's not just standing there with her torch. She's actually stepping toward the harbor, seemingly walking out to sea to greet the incoming immigrants and visitors. In addition to this fresh perspective, the book is filled with fun facts about the statue, the sculptor who created it, and where it came from. 	 ","At a time when anti-immigrant sentiments and policies re being hotly debated, this upbeat, funny, artistically stunning book about the Statue of Liberty couldn't be more timely.

Kindred Souls,Gentle tale of a boy fulfilling his grandfather's last wish.,"Jake knows his 88-year-old grandfather, Billy, will live forever. Every day during the summer, Jake and Billy take the same walk around the farm. And every day, when they come to the small wall that's all that remains of the sod house Billy grew up in, Billy says, ""I miss that sod house."" When Billy gets sick and has to go the hospital, Jake is sure he'll be OK. All the same, he decides to rebuild the sod house for Billy. Jake's parents and siblings get drawn into the project, too, and it becomes a bond among all of them as they anticipate Billy's homecoming.

Jake witnesses various phases of life on the farm -- a calf is born, the hummingbirds get ready to go south -- and always, in the midst of the modern-day tractors and computers, the past is kept alive through his grandfather's memories and Billy's interest in them. It's a sweet and honest look at a boy's last days with his grandfather, from the Newbery Award-winning author of the Sarah, Plain and Tall series. ","Parents need to know that Kindred Souls is a story about the last months of a grandfather's life, told from the point of view of his 10-year-old grandson, Jake.

Holding Up the Universe,"Insightful, inspiring romance full of surprises.","HOLDING UP THE UNIVERSE follows the relationship that grows between Libby Strout and Jack Masselin, two teens who meet because of a vicious bullying ""game"" that lands them in group counseling. Libby, who became known as ""American's Fattest Teen"" when she had to be cut out of her home, is returning to school after years away mourning her mother and tending to her own health. Jack is hiding the fact he can't recognize faces, not even his own, so he overcompensates by trying to be the life of the party. To protect himself, he ends up making Libby a target for bullies. But Libby can stand her ground, and her confidence, enthusiasm, and hope make Jack take a long, hard look at his own choices.
","This unflinching look at courage in the face of bullying is unforgettable, primarily for its remarkable heroine: She's fierce, funny, and absolutely done with being mocked and targeted for her size. Libby and her counterpart, Jack, take turns telling their story in Holding Up the Universe: Both speak intimately and honestly, confronting difficult truths about themselves and the people they're closest to. Despite their unique circumstances, the struggles they face -- to be seen, to be heard, to be respected, to be given room to be themselves -- are universal.
Libby, Jack, and his brother Dusty are remarkably self-aware, empathic, and considerate -- almost overly so. Teen readers might find these characters rather unrealistic in their frank courage, but odds are they'll be adopted as inspirational heroes. This is a terrific book for encouraging teens to be their own wonderful selves.","Parents need to know that Holding Up the Universe deals frankly with fat-shaming, bullying, depression, and peer pressure. It's another patient, emotionally complex story by author Jennifer Niven (All the Bright Places). Her two teen heroes both have difficult histories: Libby's mother died unexpectedly, and Libby, who is white, is terrified of dying herself. Jack, who is biracial, is full of secrets: that he has a disorder that makes even loved ones unrecognizable, and that his father, in remission from cancer, has been carrying on an affair with a teacher at Jack's school. There's frank talk about sexual attraction and desire, and there's some making out, frequent strong language (including ""f--k"" and ""s--t""), and some drinking and drug use. It's a harsh but clear-eyed look at what's on the mind of teens, and messages of resilience, courage, and joy shine through.

Magic in the Mix,"Exciting time-travel sequel has big ideas, mild peril.","Molly and Miri are 11-year-old twins who are just beginning to explore the magic that exists in their Victorian farmhouse. When construction at the house reveals new magical portals for discovery, they decide to go back to 1935 and see what other adventures are in store for them. But each new travel adventure brings up new possibilities for fun and danger and the chance that they could change their own shared history forever.
","MAGIC IN THE MIX takes this series about twins with a special gift for time travel to an even more considered, heartfelt place. Here, Miri and Molly return to 1935 to see the mother and father Molly never knew, travel to 1910 and to Virginia during the Civil War, and meet characters from their past at different points in their histories. They're both smart, headstrong, curious characters who inspire readers to think more deeply about their own environments and history. There's a bit of danger and some scenes of mild verbal abuse, but overall, this is a rewarding, clever book about the nature of time, relationships, love, and what it means to shape your own destiny.","Parents need to know that Magic in the Mix by Annie Barrows (Ivy + Bean) is the sequel to The Magic Half. Here time-traveling twins Molly and Miri have more exciting adventures in which they learn more about and shape their pasts. There's some mild danger, the discussion of a mother who died in childbirth and a family situation with verbal abuse that's been escaped, and some scenes of the Civil War.

Magonia,"Appealing heroine, vague world-building in exciting fantasy.","Aza, about to turn 16, has spent her life in and out of hospitals. She's had trouble breathing her whole life nd is a veteran of every kind of test or invasive procedure you can imagine. She met Jason when they were 5, and both sensed a special bond right away. Just as their friendship is maturing into something deeper, Aza is taken away from Earth to discover a world up in the clouds called MAGONIA, where ships sail the skies with crews of bird-like humans and human-like birds. In Magonia she can breathe freely and learns who and what she was meant to be. But can she bring herself to leave Jason -- and all those she loves back home -- forever?
","Funny, quirky heroes, mystery, and exciting action keep the pages turning in this imaginative novel. Uneven descriptions make some fantasy elements hard to visualize, but teen fantasy fans content to go along for the ride will find an intriguing new world to delve into. Author Dahvana Headley excels at getting inside her protagonists' minds and emotions. She creates vivid, believable characters who are easy to relate to and fun to root for.
But some aspects of the fantasy world she creates don't quite come together to create a believable whole, and the reader is left with only a vague understanding of what's being described. This creates a sensation that the author was grasping at novelty rather than telling a story that had to be told. Still, teens, especially fantasy fans, are unlikely to let these occasional lapses affect their enjoyment of an otherwise compelling story.","Parents need to know that Magonia is a fantasy novel from Maria Dahvana Headley, who coedited the story collection Unnatural Creatures with Neil Gaiman. Fifteen-year-old Aza has a rare disorder that makes breathing difficult, and she's frequently in peril from medical emergencies. Fantasy violence is infrequent, mostly battles or fighting with swords and arrows. Pain and blood from injuries are briefly described a few times. There's some hand-holding, characters' noticing physical attractiveness, and one kiss. Strong language is infrequent but includes ""f--ker,"" ""s--t,"" and ""ass"" once or twice each. Positive messages emphasize strong family and friendship bonds.

All in a Day,Book shows the many commonalities we all share.,"Ten celebrated children's artists give substance to the idea of commonality: We may live in different places, speak different languages, wear different clothes, and pursue different dreams, but we are all here on Earth--right now, each in our own country--and we all share the joys of laughter and learning and life.
 ","This braided tale of a day on Earth is good fun, but not easy fun. Keeping track of all the strands demands attention. Fortunately, even if you confuse a story or two, the artwork will keep you rapt, and the notion of humankind sharing the planet shines right through.
The artwork is just terrific, for both its quality and its diversity. Oils, pen-and-ink, colored pencils, collage -- a wealth of media is used to very special effect, one that unites while observing and saluting our differences. The artists have endeavored to illustrate special cultural aspects of their countries. The accompanying story of the boy shipwrecked on an island gets lost in the welter of imagery, and readers may wish they had more from the pen of Mitsumasa Anno.","Parents need to know that the story is divided into eight frames per two-page spread, and following the action through a day can be quite fun.

"The Blood of Olympus: The Heroes of Olympus, Book 5","Satisfying finale full of gods, giants, and fond farewells.","As usual for the demigods aboard the Argo II, there's so much to do and so little time before the end of the world. Gaia, the vengeance-hungry earth goddess, is set to wake August 1. The Greek and Roman aspects of the gods are still at war and unable to stop her. And the whole Roman demigod army is camped outside Greek Camp Half-Blood, ready to attack on doomsday. To restore peace between the Romans and Greeks, Reyna, Coach Hedge, and Nico jump ship with the confiscated Athena Parthenos statue in a desperate attempt to reach camp on time. Easier said than done. Nico's fancy son-of-Hades shadow jumping keeps blowing them way off course, and the lethal hunter Orion is hot on their trail. Back on the Argo II, Leo, Piper, Hazel, Frank, and of course Percy and Annabeth set sail for Gaia's grand wake-up party, with dangerous quests along the way. They're able to skirt southern Greece to avoid the worst of the creatures after them, but they can't avoid them all.
","Longtime Rick Riordan fans will be satisfied. In the Heroes of Olympus series, the characters have discovered a whole new camp of demigods and their Roman-god parents, helped poor Percy and Jason through their amnesia, survived oodles of battles with giants and other vengeful creatures, traveled all over Italy and Greece in a flying dragon-powered ship, and have literally gone to hell -- Hades -- and back.
Big Percy fans may complain that their favorite demigod doesn't get much to do. But he already had a whole series. Jason, Piper, Nico, Reyna, and Leo take turns being the narrator in THE BLOOD OF OLYMPUS. Reyna and Piper are the most fearless and fun to watch take on their enemies. Though Leo, s usual, dds most to the humor, he also takes on the heaviest burden. Readers will root for him and Nico, who comes a long way to understand and accept himself. It's hard to say goodbye to such great characters.","Parents need to know that The Blood of Olympus is the last book in The Heroes of Olympus series that spun off from the über-popular Percy Jackson series. It's about teen demigods (who have one Greek- or Roman-god parent) on quests to save humanity from ancient monsters still at large in the world. Author Rick Riordan combines plenty of action and danger (usually not gory -- monsters may get decapitated, but they disappear into dust when they die) mixed with lots of humor and learning. Some minor characters die from arrow wounds and from an explosion, there are many battles with injuries, and there's a threat that one of the seven demigods will die as well (but we won't give that away). The diverse cast includes Asian, African-American, Latino, and straight and gay characters.

Escape! The Story of the Great Houdini,Engrossing Houdini bio by kids' author/magician.,"Children's author, magician, and friend of Bess Houdini (the magician's wife) Sid Fleischman sorts out the myths from the reality in the life of Harry Houdini.
Born Erich Weiss, son of a rabbi in Budapest, Hungary, in 1874, he emigrated to American as a small boy, and ended up in Appleton, Wisconsin, which he later claimed as his birthplace. Impoverished, Erich ran away from home at age 12, hoping to make enough money to send some back to his family.
But working at shining shoes, selling papers, and carrying messages earned him barely enough to scrape by. In his teens he began to study magic, and named himself after a famous French illusionist. Eventually he became the most famous magician, escape artist, and debunker of spiritualists of all time. Includes bibliography and index.
","Put this one on that special shelf -- so far, it's way too small -- of biographies that kids will actually get excited about.
Author Sid Fleischman has been a professional magician, and he knew the subject's wife. So he has both a personal and professional connection to his material, and it shows on nearly every page. In this lively, entertaining biography, Fleischman does more than just retell the major events of Houdini's life, and even more than separate myth from fact (a tricky job in this case). He carefully walks readers through the evidence and his own reasoning process, making good use of his insider knowledge along the way.
He includes numerous photographs, some from his personal collection published here for the first time. And he uses his well-known humor and some novelistic writing techniques to make this bio what all of them ought to be: an engrossing story. ","Parents need to know that there is little to be concerned with in this biography, other than the possibility that kids may try to reproduce Houdini's feats.

Richard Scarry's Cars and Trucks and Things That Go,Excellent vocab builder is also big wacky fun.,"The pig family drives their car from home to the beach for a picnic and home again. Along the way they encounter almost every imaginable vehicle on the road, rail, and waterways, and some only Richard Scarry has imagined -- such as a giant pickle truck, a hammer car, and a wolf wagon. Meanwhile Officer Flossy is in hot pursuit of Dingo the dog who knocked over a whole row of parking meters in his flashy red car and is trying to escape a ticket. \""Go get him, Officer Flossy!\""
","Long story short, this is a book that really grows with kids and gets them pointing, talking, laughing, and learning; what a wonderful investment.
Parents can approach this book in many stages. Toddlers, with their shorter attention spans, get the ""point and laugh"" method, attention given to silliness like the pickle truck and a cheese car filled with mice. Months later, a bit of the storyline can be added. Kids can track the pig family car, and parents can try to get through some of the text. Or just follow Officer Flossy as she chases Dingo -- another exciting option. When parents get through the whole story for the first time it's a real accomplishment.
	Then it's time to find Goldbug on every page. That could involve a whole week of intense study and lots of shouting ""there's Goldbug!"" Then you can return to the story and enjoy it all over again.","Parents need to know that this is THE book to get kids who love vehicles and are just starting to string together words and simple sentences. With lots to see and talk about on every page, it'll really get their motors running. Of course with any book filled with moving machines there are a few accidents, but it's all kept light with exploding mustard and flying bananas. In the back of a vehicle dubbed the ""bigshot car,"" a pig smokes a cigar.

Beauty Queens,"Sharp satire mixes girl-power themes with violence, sex.","When their plane crashes en route to an exotic Miss Teen Dream pageant location, the surviving teen BEAUTY QUEENS must fend for themselves in a jungle full of snakes ... both animal and human. Because it just so happens that The Corporation -- a fictional megacompany responsible for everything from feminine hygiene products to reality shows like Captains Bodacious -- has already set up shop on the same island, and the girls' arrival could throw a serious wrench into plans to (naturally) take over the world. But all that cynical Adina, resourceful Taylor, earnest Tiara, scheming Shanti, statuesque Petra, and the rest of the Teen Dreamers know is that they have to survive -- and so they do. Working together to build shelter, catch fish, and set up defenses -- all while keeping their pageant skills sharp -- the girls quickly learn that there may be more to life than winning their next crown.
","Beauty Queens is the kind of book that might have you shaking your head as you giggle. Author Libba Bray skewers everything from trashy TV (you'll wish you could set your DVR for Patriot Daughters, about sexed-up Revolutionary War heroines) to world politics (Elvis-loving megalomaniac villain MoMo B. ChaCha is clearly a stand-in for North Korea's Kim Jong-il). But while nearly every aspect of the book is exaggerated for humor, the core characters and the lessons they learn about embracing themselves and one another (sometimes literally...) are valuable, especially for teen girls who might feel as boxed in by society's expectations for how they look and dress and behave as these characters do by the pageant lifestyle.
 The satire is assisted by a well-paced story that moves along briskly; the twists may not be wholly unexpected (Petra's secret won't be too hard to guess, for one, and the arrival of more castaways isn't exactly a shocker), but you'll be too distracted laughing at the various footnotes and commercial breaks (for Corporation products, naturally) to notice. And when you're done laughing, the book's messages about acceptance, friendship, love, and girl power will linger as long as a good self-tanner.","Parents need to know that this Lost-meets-Clueless satire is packed with thought-provoking issues and characters -- as well as plenty of laughs directed at corporate America and the world of beauty pageants. The jungle-stranded teen girls at the heart of the story learn valuable lessons about believing in themselves and working together; they also have sex, drink, swear, and use weapons (sometimes killing people). Sexual orientation is a theme of the book -- one character is transgendered, and another is a lesbian; there's some same-sex kissing and making out. While the book is relentless about taking shots at everything from reality TV to politics to beauty products, its core themes of self-reliance, friendship, and girl power (aka feminism) shine through.

From the moment that Phantom and her foal, Misty, are brought to Chincoteague, Paul and Maureen overcome one obstacle after another to make these wild creatures their own. ","Horse lovers for generations have thrilled to this tale of wild ponies who resist capture at every turn. The setting and Marguerite Henry's vivid writing style work to make it rise above your average child-and-horse story. Set in the Tidewater area of Virginia, the book is filled with that region's colorful dialect (""Seems as if the devil is allus sittin' cross-legged of me"").
Younger readers will quickly find themselves involved in the drama of this captivating tale, but those used to today's fast pace and relentless action may find the book slow. Readers of all ages will enjoy Wesley Dennis' illustrations of the wild ponies, but they may find that his depictions of the children don't help pinpoint the children's ages, which are not given in the text either.
 ","Parents need to know that Marguerite Henry's classic story of two kids capturing and taming a wild pony, first published in 1947, has thrilled horse lovers for generations.

Then he selects a snuggly reading buddy (his dog) and a cozy reading spot. Step by step, he guides readers through the joys of reading a book: contemplating the cover and guessing what it might be about, giving the characters life with different voices, working through unfamiliar words, and finally getting to the end ... at which point you can, if you like, go back to the beginning and start again.
","A how-to book on reading a book might seem odd. But families will quickly realize that it’s actually a terrific approach to helping children develop a lifelong love of reading. Author Kate Messner offers easy-to-follow advice, such as, ""When you get to the exciting parts, make your voice sound exciting, too,"" nd sample excerpts kids can use for practice.

The Great Good Thing,Great for kids who love books.,"""Sylvie had an amazing life, but she didn't get to live it very often.""From that auspicious opening sentence springs the story of Princess Sylvie, a character in a book that has been gathering dust for years. While waiting for a Reader, the characters while away the time, but when a Reader finally opens the Book they all scramble to take their places and enact the story yet again.
Sylvie, bored and curious, breaks the rules and finds her way out of the Book and into the dreams of a Reader named Claire. Her parents are outraged, but when Claire's brother accidentally sets fire to the Book, it is Sylvie who leads the characters into Claire's mind. There they attempt to reconstruct the story, but freedom from the Book's strictures, as well as the vagaries of Claire's maturing mind, brings unwelcome changes. As Claire ages, their continued survival may depend on the mysterious ""girl with the dark blue eyes,"" who flits through Claire's dreams and waking thoughts and seems to know all about the Book.
","It has often been said that one of the great things about books is that the characters and story are there, waiting for the reader to bring them to life; in this story, this is literally true. When the book is closed, blue back-up lights come on and the characters find ways to pass the time until the next time they reenact their story.
This offbeat, philosophical little book is not for every child. Though it certainly has some action and adventure, it also introduces some big ideas about the nature of reality, mortality, dreams, and artistic creation. But for a child who loves books, thinking, and wondering it is a unique treasure, and a new way to look at the world of imagination.","Parents need to know that this is a philosophical little story with some big ideas.

Both Sides of Time,Fast-moving pulp fiction.,"Annie, 15, can't stand her boyfriend Sean's resistance to romance. She's fascinated by the old mansion that's about to be torn down. She takes a last look inside, imagining herself at a sumptuous ball there, when suddenly she falls back into 1895. She wanders all the rooms, fingering the polished wood and rich fabrics, and meets Strat, the son of the mansion's autocratic owner.
The two immediately fall in love. Rich but homely Harriet, however, hopes tomarry Strat, even though he hasn't proposed yet. When he ignores her, she agrees to marry the odious Clarence Rowwels, who wants her for her money. A murdermystery intrudes when Rowwels accuses Irish maid, Bridget, of pushing another servant down the stairs. But Florence, Strat's weak stepmother, saves Harriet and Bridget when she learns that Rowwels is the murderer, and shoots him. Annie travels in time again, but to when?
","This time-travel romance, the first in a series, both entertains and teaches, though it recycles the hackneyed plots and conventions of the potboiler romance. The story is practically lifted from the gothic romances of an earlier era, complete with murder and Irish maids speaking brogue, which destroys any literary pretensions for the book. Caroline Cooney writes authentic teen dialogue, and juxtaposes Annie's modern speech with Strat's proper Victorian English in an almost comic fashion.
But the way in which Cooney depicts the restrictions on women gives the book some value beyond pulp entertainment. Few teenagers realize how far women have come in 100 years. In BOTH SIDES OF TIME upper-class women have no control over their lives -- they are imprisoned in corsets, gasping for breath, fainting frequently, and obeying men in all things. Though somewhat overstated, the cultural history here will open readers' eyes.","Parents need to know that despite the potboiler story, readers will get a realistic sense of the difficulties women faced in the 19th century, along with interesting contrasts between modern and Victorian spoken English.

Septimus Heap Series,"Charming series for kids not ready for big, dark fantasies.","Just after the apparent death of the sprawling, wizardly Heap family's newborn seventh son, they are given a baby girl, Jenna, to care for. Ten years later they are forced to flee their home in the Castle when it turns out the girl is the daughter of the murdered queen, and the Supreme Custodian, who has taken over the city, sends an assassin to complete his destruction of the royal family. Pursued by a professional Hunter, and accompanied by the ExtraOrdinary Wizard, a ghost, and a young soldier known only as Boy 412, they head into the Marram Marshes to find refuge with their Aunt Zelda, the White Witch. But the Necromancer, DomDaniel, who is in league with the Supreme Custodian, is determined to see them all destroyed.
","This author may have slept through the classes in Story Construction and Character Development, but she was the star pupil in Blithe Spirit. With a light touch and gentle humor, she carries readers through this overlong first novel, with some explosions of imagination along the way. A wealth of fascinating magical creatures and an intriguing new design for magic make this a delightful, at times exciting, read.
Septimus, now apprentice to the ExtraOrdinary Wizard, seems to be the only one alarmed with his brother Simon, doing the bidding of Necromancer DomDaniel, rides off with Princess Jenna. He knows she's been kidnapped and goes after her. This installment is just as fun as the first with the same light touch and unique approach to magic. It's nice to see Septimus fleshing out as a character, learning magic, and facing his fears.
 Septimus is kidnapped through a magic glass and taken back 500 years to be the apprentice of alchemist Marcellus Pye. Meanwhile Pye's mother, Queen Etheldredda, haunts the present and attempts to reclaim the crown from Jenna. There are plenty of what-ifs with the time travel theme, but the story bogs down in its length and some of the heart is missing in this installment. Queen Ehteldredda is a fun villain, however.
Thanks to a cruel ghost, Septimus is set up for a quest that no other apprentice has returned from -- but not if he escapes the Questing Guards first. He, Jenn, and his friend Beetle would rather rescue Nikko and Snorri, stranded in the distant past in book 3. It takes almost 300 pages for the trio to hit the road and this book is poorer for it. The focus should have been on their journey, not a slew of minor characters.","Parents need to know that among current fantasy novels, this is among the least dark or violent, and almost uniquely in this genre, fighting and killing are not portrayed as the answer to anything and are assiduously avoided, villains are seen as redeemable, and heroes are both stronger and more compassionate than their enemies. This series' gentleness makes it especially recommended for those not quite ready for the big, dark fantasies.

After she's struck by a car and sent to the emergency room in Scottsdale, Ariz., Shelby sets off with her mom on a sudden quest to visit the Grand Canyon. Uprooted and confused, Shelby isn't sure what to make of her mother's behavior or of her own strange dreams, which feature a shape-shifting boy named Mark and a cast of talking animals. Gradually, however, she begins to understand that she has difficult, dangerous choices to make in whichever world she resides and that even more upsetting revelations lie ahead.
","THERE WILL BE LIES is a tricky thriller with a believable nd sympathetic teen protagonist. Author Nick Lake sustains the suspense from first chapter to last, delivering plenty of plot twists while still paying attention to the psychological reality of the story he's devised.
Because Shelby's visits to the Dreaming at first feel unconnected from the main narrative, those scenes feel a little draggy, until Lake makes it clear how high the stakes truly are. He also treats the Native American mythology with respect, capturing the conflicted nature of the trickster god Coyote, and he paints a vivid portrait of the Southwest.","Parents need to know that Nick Lake's There Will Be Lies is an intense thriller about a deaf teenager who learns that much of her relationship with her mother is based on lies. There's some strong language (""hell"" and ""fricking"" are used frequently, ""bitch,"" ""ass,"" and ""pissed"" less so) nd a few violent scenes, the most intense of which include a stabbing nd a standoff with a shotgun. Shelby's mom flirts with an older male acquaintance and spends the night with him behind closed doors. Shelby begins to smoke tobacco late in the novel, and her mother drinks alcohol in one scene.

Tea Cakes for Tosh,"Touching story of boy's bond with grandma, family history.","Tosh loves it when his Grandma Honey makes her tea cakes -- an old family recipe from his Great-Great-Great-Great-Grandma Ida -- and tells him the story of them, which always begins, \""Long ago, before you and I were born, our people were enslaved.\"" Ida would bake the tea cakes for the plantation owner's family, but sneak a few for her own children and other young slaves. \""She risked being whipped to give the children a taste of freedom ... a promise of days to come,\"" says Grandma Honey. But when she starts to get forgetful and even forgets the recipe, Tosh asks Mama to help him make the tea cakes and surprises Grandma Honey with not only the tea cakes but also the story, beginning, as usual, with, \""Long ago, before you and I were born, our people were enslaved.\""
","TEA CAKES FOR TOSH is a warm, sensitive story that recalls the slave period in American History. It celebrates family ties and the courage of our ancestors, and delicately captures the confusion a kid may feel when an older loved one shows signs of senility or Alzheimer's. Caldecott-winning illustrator E.B. Lewis' gorgeous watercolors are full of emotion and perfectly suited to this gentle, moving tale.","Parents need to know that Tea Cakes for Tosh is a moving story about the bond between a grandmother and grandson that recalls a family's slave past and celebrates the importance of stories than connect us to our ancestors. It also shows the complex reality of a young boy discovering his beloved grandma is losing her memory. Full of love and tenderness, Tea Cakes for Tosh is a great read-aloud for kids who know a bit about slavery and are ready for a sensitive treatment of an older person's growing forgetfulness.

Nothing Rhymes with Orange,Lots of fruity fun in rhyming tale of fruit and friendship.,"NOTHING RHYMES WITH ORANGE is a juicy mix of rhymes about various fruits, with forlorn Orange commenting from the sidelines, since nothing rhymes with orange. The other fruits are having lots of fun. We see a surfing banana in ""Hit the beach in your cabana with a peach and a banana."" And superhero grapes appear in the verse ""And these grapes are wearing capes because they’re SUPER good to eat."" At first, Orange tries to insert himself into the fun. ""Hey, are you guys going to need me for this book?... I'll be back here if you need me."" But as the rhymes get sillier, he starts to sulk. ""Well, that was a little forced."" And when the book introduces a ""pearwolf"" and even Nietzsche (slotted into a rhyme), he despairs. ""This book's sorta gone off the rails."" Observant Apple notices Orange is alone, and makes up a rhyme involving the made-up word ""smorange,"" thus inviting Orange to join in the fruity fun.
","This book is a romp of a rhyming party serving up a big fruity word salad, and though Orange isn't initially included since he doesn't rhyme, kids and parents are invited for the fun. Readers are always in good hands with author-illustrator Adam Rex, who goes all-out in Nothing Rhymes with Orange. The fruits in the art are photo-realistic, making them easily recognizable for kids just learning the differences, and Rex draws expressive faces nd arms and legs to animate them. There's lots of wordplay: A pear that gets bitten by a wolf becomes a ""pearwolf."" And the book gets sillier and sillier with each page, even including a joke referencing Nietzsche, making sure adults feel included, too: ""I think cherries are 'the berries' and a lychee is just peachy. Thus Spoke Zarathustra in  book by Friedrich Nietzsche.""
Adding to the fun are the snide comments by Orange, who observes dejectedly from the sidelines. ""This book's sorta gone off the rails. I'm glad I'm not a part of it."" But Rex also has a warm heart, and makes sure we feel for Orange as he grows more and more disheartened. Kids will recognize the feelings nd cheer when another fruit notices and pulls him into the festivities. This book is both silly and a warm story about feelings and friendship, making it a very fun party indeed.","Parents need to know that Nothing Rhymes with Orange is by Adam Rex, who has often distinguished himself as a very clever author (School's First Day of School) nd as an equally clever illustrator (The Legend of Rock Paper Scissors), and who here wears both very funny hats. In this rhyming book about fruit, lots of fruits are celebrated in rhyme, except for Orange, since as every lyricist and picture book writer knows, ""Nothing rhymes with orange."" The couplets are great, silly fun, but there's an emotional component as well, as Orange feels more and more left out and deflated, and Apple notices, coming up with a nonsense rhyme to include Orange and bring him into the fold.

Secrets at Sea,"Great story, characters make mouse journey instant classic.","Helena and her three siblings are the current representatives of a very old mouse family inhabiting the Cranston home in the Hudson River Valley. Sudden change looms when the Upstairs Cranstons (the humans), having failed to find a suitable young man for older daughter Olive, take the notion to sail for Europe in search of husband prospects willing to overlook her deficiencies in favor of Papa's money.  As the oldest, Helena has other worries -- sister Louise insists on being friends with human Cranston Camilla (perilous, in the centuries-old relationship in which the human family tends not to know about its rodent counterpart), sister Beatrice is sneaking out at night to meet an undesirable boy, and brother Lamont is forever getting into life-threatening scrapes. After consulting the local mouse granny, she realizes there's nothing to be done but to pack up her little family in Camilla's trunk and stow away on the transatlantic voyage -- even though they're all mortally terrified of water -- in search of a better future for themselves and the human Cranstons, as well.
","SECRETS AT SEA is a great novel, with an inventive plot and ingenious characters who, despite being mice, are easy to relate to as they deal with their sibling issues. Younger kids who aren't quite at this reading level will still enjoy the characters, the story, and the cute illustrations, even though some nuances of the narration will go right by them. Older kids will love these details, from snarks at the boy-crazy Beatrice to the complicated protocols of being a faithful mouse retainer in the royal palace, unbeknownst to the actual royals involved.","Parents need to know that the latest from Newbery Award winner Richard Peck is another gem. Its cute characters will appeal to younger kids, but there's enough substance and whimsy to the plot and characters to keep older kids amused and interested, as well. It's a good, lighthearted intro to Victoriania and some of the more arcane customs of the era.

Darius the Great Is Not Okay,"Unforgettable, heartwarming story of friendship and family.","Darius Grover Kellner, the main character in DARIUS THE GREAT IS NOT OKAY, is Half-Persian and half-American, overweight, bad at sports, a serious Star Trek nerd, and works after school at a local tea shop -- all of which makes him a target for verbal bullying by the jocks at his Portland, Oregon, high school. It doesn't help that his architect father keeps telling him to stand up to them and try to ""act a little more normal."" This hurts Darius to the core, as he's never understood why his father has emotionally shut him out. They only spend time together in the evenings, when they watch a single episode of Star Trek. But they share one very significant thing in common: Both are taking medication for clinical depression. When Darius' mother learns that her father is dying of cancer, the family decides it's time to make a first visit to Iran for Darius and his younger sister, Laleh. The visit is a life- changer for him, as he makes a first-ever best friend, a teen neighbor named Sohrab. They bond over playing soccer (Darius discovers he's actually pretty good at it) and the fact that they both feel like outsiders (Sohrab is a Bahai, an often-discriminated minority in Iran). ","This gentle, heartwarming cross-cultural coming-of-age story delivers a profound message of hope for any teen who's struggled with depression or felt they'd never fit in. There's no sex or violence or profanity-laced dialogue in Darius the Great Is Not Okay, simply an almost-impossible-to-put-down story told by a nerdy teen with a wicked sense of humor, who, like so many boys and girls in middle and high school, is picked on simply because he has different interests and looks different.","Parents need to know that Adib Khorram's utterly captivating cross-cultural coming-of-age novel Darius the Great Is Not Okay chronicles a few life-changing weeks in the life of Darius Grover Kellner, a half-Persian half-American sophomore at a Portland, Oregon, high school. Darius is overweight, taking medication for clinical depression, verbally bullied, and friendless. And it's just not at school where Darius feels left out. His relationship with his father consists of watching a single Star Trek episode together each evening. But when the family makes a trip to Iran to visit his mother's dying father, Darius unexpectedly makes a friend. The story stays away from politics (one character has a father who's a political prisoner) and focuses instead on family, friends, and the rhythm of everyday life in Iran. This is a must-read for any teen who's ever felt left out or struggled to fit in. The novel has won numerous awards, including the 2019 Morrison Award, presented by the Young Adult Library Services Association to an outstanding first-time author writing for teens.

Freckleface Strawberry and the Dodgeball Bully,Imaginative girl tackles bully in upbeat playground story.,"FRECKLEFACE STRAWBERRY AND THE DODGEBALL BULLY deals with a game that many kids dread playing: dodgeball. Some kids, especially if they're the same size and have the same ability, love the game. But, for players of different sizes with different skills, it can be frightening. And it can give a borderline bully the perfect chance to dominate the group. That's what happens here. The bully's a very large child with the not-so-flattering name of Windy Pants Patrick. His much smaller classmate, Freckleface Strawberry, generally loves to play, but she dreads rainy days when she has to play dodgeball, especially when he has the ball. It looks, and sounds, like it really hurts when he smacks the other kids with the ball. She tries to hide out, but eventually comes up with a plan of her own that solves her problem and teaches Windy Pants an important lesson. It turns out that getting hit with the ball doesn't really hurt, and Windy Pants Patrick isn't such a bad guy after all.
 ","Julianne Moore's storytelling is inspiring and hilarious (especially when read aloud), and her character Freckleface Strawberry is as cute and indomitable as ever. The story of Freckleface Strawberry and Windy Pants Patrick will sound very familiar to most people, kids and adults alike, especially if they've ever played dodgeball. The expressive brush and digital illustrations of LeUyen Pham again are the perfect complement to Moore's playful narrative that teaches a gentle lesson. Those who liked the first Freckleface book are sure to love this second adventure, and will look forward to hearing more of this brave little character. ","Parents should know Freckleface Strawberry and the Dodgeball Bully is the second title in Julianne Moore's picture book series about a feisty little girl named Freckleface Strawberry. This time she's dealing with a playground bully, a scary game, and her own fears, not her freckles. Her story offers a great opportunity to talk about the bullying that can happen as part of a game, as well as what makes a game fun or not.

So starts this book about a curious boy who has all sorts of questions about everything from taffy to toucans. His questions are funny and often absurd questions -- and span everything from giraffes to kiddy pools.
","This delightful book is a must for curious kids with a thousand questions. The questions are often silly and nonsensical -- ""Would a happy toucan from the Yucatan become cantankerous up in Anchorage or the Yukon? -- but the puns, rhymes, tongue twisters, and frequent use of words that sound alike make the book fun to read aloud. Beginning readers especially will be tickled s they sound out the rhythmic passages slowly, and then more quickly. Wild, animated illustrations done in acrylics bring the text to life.","Parents need to know that the main character in this book has a lot of funny questions. This book's poetic language makes it great to read aloud -- and fun for new readers, too.

The Pigman,Teens grasp impact of their hurtfulness in emotional novel.,"Troubled teens John and Lorraine, and a couple of their misfit friends, play a game to pass the time: They phone strangers picked randomly from the phone book, and compete to see who can keep a stranger on the phone the longest. Lorraine calls a man in her neighborhood, and engages him by saying she's soliciting money for charity. Later, John convinces Lorraine that they should visit the man, Mr. Pignati, and collect his $10 pledge. Lorraine has misgivings, but she goes along, and when they meet the ""Pigman,"" the young people are half-tempted and half-touched by Mr. Pignati's overstuffed house, his generosity, and his loneliness. The older man offers the kids the respect and warmth that they don't get from their rigid parents, and his lonely life gives the teens new perspective on their families and their own places in the world. But teens will test boundaries, even very loose ones, and John and Lorraine misjudge big-time in a way that tests all of their relationships.
","This is a hugely entertaining story that adolescent readers will appreciate for being meaningful without being moralistic and having complex characters that are not black-and-white. The bad guys are also good, and the good guys are also bad. John and Lorraine are sympathetic but always very real-seeming teens who lie to their parents, make big mistakes, and have a lot to learn about the impact of their behavior. Their parents are quite flawed, but they're whole people who show the effects of their own challenging lives. And the Pigman is a loving gift of a character.","Parents need to know that The Pigman is a searing, emotional young adult novel in which two teen siblings learn the impact they can have as kind -- or hurtful -- friends. Written by Paul Zindel, a Pulitzer Prize winner for his play The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds, this book depicts the unusual friendship between two troubled high school teens and a kind older gentleman named Mr. Pignati. It's narrated by the teens, Lorraine and John, who alternate chapters in which they reveal details about their problems at home as well as about their friendships. Teens and adults in the book drink and smoke. John does both. There's also ""cursing,"" though it's mostly masked, as John uses symbols (@#$%) instead of actual strong language. Violent and scary situations include a mother losing her temper and slapping her daughter, and an ill man collapsing and falling down.

Santa and the Three Bears,Bland but enjoyable story for preschoolers.,"Mrs. Claus is planning a surprise party for Santa when he returns from delivering toys. She and the elves set out to find a tree to decorate, but she accidentally leaves the door open.
A family of bears enter the house to get warm. They eat the food, mess up the room, trash the workshop, flatten the chairs, and finally fall asleep in Santa's bed.
Mrs. Claus makes the bears help clean up and make more food. When Santa comes home, they have a party. But since there are no presents for the bears, Santa gives Papa Bear his compass, Mrs. Claus gives Mama Bear her coat, and the elves give Baby Bear their sled.
","This is a pleasant story for preschoolers -- a little bland and overly cute, but enjoyable for many. The reversal on the Goldilocks story brings a grin of recognition and a feeling of cleverness to many young listeners.
The pictures, though, are uninspired. All are muted and lack energy, making it look as though they don't have adequate lighting in the Claus home. There's a surprising amount of brown for a Christmas story. Santa's workshop is especially disappointing, looking more like a dull closet on moving day than the workshop where toys for all the children of the world are made.","Parents need to know that the bears behave badly but do have to clean up later.

The Wednesday Wars,"Funny, breathtakingly poignant '60s coming-of-age tale.","On Wednesdays afternoons half of Holling's class leaves school early for catechism class. The other half leaves early for Hebrew school. That leaves Presbyterian Holling alone every Wednesday afternoon with his teacher, Mrs. Baker. Neither of them is happy at the prospect, and Holling is sure Mrs. Baker hates him as a result. At first Mrs. Baker just has Holling clean erasers, but then decides to make better use of the time by introducing him to Shakespeare. And as events in the larger world during the 1967-68 school year unfold in the background, Holling begins to learn about himself, his family, friends, and the mysterious adult world.
","It's a wonderful thing when an author can bring the reader to tears without anything sad happening. It's even better when it's done in the course of what would normally be described as ""hilarious misadventures."" Author Gary D. Schmidt accomplishes this by getting inside the head of a bright but fairly typical goofball seventh-grader who's doing the opposite of what so many kids at that age do -- opening his heart to the world.
With the prim prodding of his dry, no-nonsense teacher, and a big dollop of help from the Bard, Holling learns to see into the hearts of others, which causes him to stand up to his overbearing father, to care for his floundering older sister when she needs him, to recognize the depth of his friendships, to see the humanity in his teachers, and ... to begin to really understand Shakespeare.

The Thief Knot: A Greenglass House Story,Intrepid tweens hunt down kidnappers in intriguing mystery.,"In THE THIEF KNOT, Marzana and her best friend Nialla moan about how nothing every happens, even though their town is a haven for outlaws. But when police officers come to ask Marzana's parents for help finding a kidnapped girl, the two friends feel they finally have the opportunity for an adventure that really matters. To find the missing girl, they'll need to assemble a crack team including a magician, an expert lock picker, a codebreaker -- oh yeah, and  ghost. When almost nothing and no one turn out to be what they seem, the kids soon learn that they'll have to unravel mysteries from the past as well as the present if they hope to catch the kidnappers.
","This standalone mystery set in the wonderfully oddball Greenglass House world is full of intrigue, puzzlement, colorful characters, and a clever plot that moves along nicely. The Thief Knot brings back old friends that fans of the series will enjoy spending time with again, while at the same time introducing a very interesting new bunch worthy of further exploration. Mystery and adventure lovers who haven't read any of the previous books will have no trouble fully immersing themselves in this refreshing new story. Tweens will easily relate to the characters and root for Marzana as she tries to help solve a crime while battling social anxiety.
The opening is a little slow, spending too much time on complaints about how nothing exciting ever happens when the reader knows good and well that something amazing is going to happen, or else what are all the rest of these pages in the book for? But hang in there until the adventure starts, and you'll be quickly absorbed in an inventively whimsical and slightly off-kilter world. There's not much imagined folklore in this story, which, compared with the other Greenglass books, makes it feel just a bit less rich. But it's a deeply imagined and vividly described world that stands up well on its own.","Parents need to know that The Thief Knot is a standalone mystery-adventure story set in the world of author Kate Milford's Greenglass House series. Reading the other books isn't necessary, but some characters from them appear here. The main plot involves middle school kids investigating the kidnapping of a girl their age, and there are a few moments of fearful speculation bout what could happen to her. The only other violence is in a confrontation with the bad guys with a knife to the throat, slamming against a locker, and a hard kick in the stomach. There are some mildly eerie locations as well as a lot of whimsical ones. A kiss on the cheek and squeezing hands are the only instances of romance. Adults drink wine with dinner, and there's one mention of a background character smoking. Strong language is very rare but includes ""crap,"" ""hell,"" and ""damn."" The group of kids model teamwork, loyalty, and using your unique talents to help the group. Strong messages include how to explore and pursue an adventure safely.

Meanwhile, she's trying to learn more about the mysterious Black Swan organization -- and why it engineered her DNA to create capabilities she's still discovering. Fear and distrust lurk behind the scenes of the outwardly harmonious elf world, and it's hard to tell people's true intentions. As Sophie tries to come to terms with her new life and learn more about her origins, the Council calls on her to perform increasingly dangerous telepathic tasks. Some characters die, others live in a state of permanent insanity, and an unknown villain's pyrotechnic powers threaten to engulf the whole world in EVERBLAZE.
","Author Shannon Messenger creates appealing, relatable characters and then keeps the plot twists, intrigues, dangers, and ethical challenges coming. Readers who've been following the Keepers of the Lost Cities series may find themselves confused about its underlying cosmology and where the truth lies on many fronts -- even more than 13-year-old Sophie. But, as with that other series about a mysterious kid at a magical boarding school, this turns out not to matter very much.
With her independent spirit, strong principles, and longing to belong, Sophie will strike a chord with many tween girls. So will the recurring humor about how magical sparkly horses poop. A lot. But other kids also will find a lot to like in this exciting installment, which concludes with a strong sense that the adventure's just beginning.","Parents need to know that Everblaze, the latest installment in Shannon Messenger's Keeper of the Lost Cities series, is another fast-moving fantasy adventure that will particularly appeal to independent-minded tween girls, thanks to a 13-year-old heroine who, when she's not trying to save her world and protect her loved ones (including a winged horse), also is dealing with such familiar issues as mean girls at school. Faint stirrings of romantic competition among three boys. There are scary scenes, some characters die, and others often control people's minds, usually without their consent.

This Dark Endeavor: The Apprenticeship of Victor Frankenstein,"Gripping, fascinating story of one soon-to-be-mad scientist.","It's just another leisurely summer at the Frankenstein family country home for 15-year-old Victor, his twin Konrad, and their cousin Elizabeth. They put on plays by their friend Henry Clerval, are home-schooled by the twins' father, and enjoy well-bred sports like sailing and fencing. Running through the house one day they uncover a secret passage leading to an even more secretive library filled to the brim with forbidden alchemy texts. At first it's just curious fun, but when Konrad falls ill and the inept medical doctors start coming and going, Victor digs deeper in the library, determined to find something that will cure him. He also starts frequenting the home of the underground alchemist Polidori for help uncovering the secret ingredients of the Elixir of Life. He finds there's good news -- only three things to find -- and bad news -- acquiring all three puts him and those he loves in grave danger.
","This is one of the best series openers to come along in a long time; no wonder the makers of the Twilight movies have already latched onto this series. The world's most famous future mad scientist was a fascinating teen as author Kenneth Oppel sees it. Readers get to watch his inner demons take shape; there's hope for him, then it's dashed just as quickly. So much is bubbling below the surface waiting for that flash of lightning.
	Add to this intense character study writing that's beautifully, darkly atmospheric and a truly gripping series of adventures (expect your jaw to visibly drop while reading in a few scenes), and you've got a winner.","Parents need to know that this imagined prequel to the classic Mary Shelley's Frankenstein shows Victor Frankenstein pre-mad scientist at the age of 15 with just a budding interest in alchemy. That doesn't mean this book is completely tame, however. Characters have brushes with death high in trees and deep in caves; are attacked, scratched, and bitten by animals; and there's one extremely tense scene where two fingers are severed. Plus, a prolonged illness of a major character eventually ends in death. Victor, of course, is growing as a conflicted character here, motivated by jealousy and ambition as often as he is by his love for his family. Elizabeth is a strong female character who is often even braver than the male characters.

"Secret Coders, Book 1","Fun, funny graphic novel promotes programming.","On her first day t Stately Academy, Hopper discovers that her new school has more than its share of creepy mysteries. The building looks like a haunted house, the walls are covered with the number 9, and there are flocks of strange, four-eyed birds everywhere. Hopper has trouble fitting in with her fellow students, has a rocky relationship with her Mandarin teacher, and gets in trouble with the principal. More promising is her growing friendship with Eni, who teaches her the fundamentals of coding -- with the help of a ""turtle"" robot. Together, Hopper and Eni try to figure out why Stately Academy is so strange.
","Learning about computer coding doesn't have to be hard, serious work, as the first book in this lighthearted, educational graphic novel series proves. Writer Gene Yang and artist Mike Holmes play to each other's strengths in SECRET CODERS, devising scenes with clever dialogue and dynamic action. Unfortunately, there's a lot of setup before it's clear exactly what the stakes are for Hopper and crew. The installment ends just as the situation is getting truly interesting. ","Parents need to know that Secret Coders by Gene Yang (Boxers & Saints, American Born Chinese) is a fantasy graphic novel that teaches coding skills to elementary and middle schoolers. The main character, 12-year-old Hopper, feels out of place on her first day at a new school, but in trying to solve various puzzles, she gains confidence and makes new friends. The only violence is an attack by robot birds. This is a fine choice for families looking for books with diverse characters, as Hopper is Asian-American nd her new best friend, Eni, appears to be African-American.

War Horse,Moving story of a horse and boy has anti-war message.,"Joey, a red-bay colt, is sold to an English farmer, whose son, Albert, raises the horse and teaches him to work their family farm. After World War I breaks out, Albert's father sells Joey to the army in order to pay the mortgage on his farm. Joey is forced to carry riders into battle, and pull artillery and carts full of wounded soldiers. As Joey struggles to survive, Albert never stops hoping they will be reunited.
","War Horse holds special appeal for horse lovers, who will care deeply about Joey's plight as he is pushed and pulled between the humans fighting World War I. The novel offers a unique perspective on the hardships endured by war horses, and the emotional and physical needs of horses in general. Because the novel is offered from a horse's point of view, however, human relationships within the book are less satisfying.","Parents need to know that War Horse uses simple language, meant to display the limited awareness of its animal narrator, to tell a poignant story with a strong anti-war message. Like Joey the horse, many of the casualties in this World War I novel understand little about why the battles are fought and lives are lost. To Joey, the fighting is cacophonous, chaotic, and random -- an eloquent statement about the pointlessness of the violence. Horse lovers will sometimes be upset by War Horse, but they will also be moved by the kindness shown to Joey and the horse's deep bond with his young master, Albert. The film version of this novel, also titled War Horse and directed by Steven Spielberg, will open Christmas Day 2011.

Harry the Dirty Dog,Expressive illustrations with old-fashioned charm.,"Harry the dog goes to great lenghts to avoid his bath. Most children love dogs, and the mischievous Harry has real-dog allure. Children can identify with Harry and the occasional desire to escape the restraints of home--and bath. Expressive illustrations, with old-fashioned charm, add funny details to the charming story.
","In print since 1956, HARRY THE DIRTY DOG testifies to the continuing appeal of a simple tale, low-key humor, and a likable main character. But what really makes this and the other Harry stories stand out is Margaret Bloy Graham's pen-and-ink, pastel-washed drawings. Harry, a black-and-white spotted mutt with little short legs, a stubby tail, and an upturned nose, is surely one of the most appealing dogs in children's literature.
Being a dog, he perceives his world in an amusingly animal-centric way. Humans, although loved and needed, are just more fauna in Harry's life, and he's smarter than his family. All this helps children rejoice in their identification with Harry, but the story isn't really about all-out rebellion. Harry appreciates his home -- he just wants to have more control over bath time.","Parents need to know that children get a vicarious kick out of Harry's escape from home, and love the verbal and visual build-up from ""very dirty"" to ""dirtier"" to ""dirtiest of all.""

The Children of Willesden Lane,Inspiring story of teen pianist who escaped Nazis in WWII.,"Based on the true story of author Mona Golabek's mother, Lisa Jura Golabek, THE CHILDREN OF WILLESDEN LANE begins when Lisa, a 14-year-old piano prodigy in Vienna, is sadly told by her piano instructor that he's no longer allowed to teach Jewish children. The restrictions in the city rapidly mount, and when her parents are able to secure a place on the Kindertransport to London, they send Lisa to what they hope will be safety. After a few false starts, she winds up at a hostel on Willesden Lane, which miraculously has a piano. The matron reads about an upcoming audition at the Royal Academy of Music. After Lisa's daily work at a factory, she practices long hours, despite war shortages and illness. Her new friends help her prepare, but what really motivates her is the promise she made to her mother to ""hold on"" to her music. Lisa's relentless in her pursuit of perfection at the keyboard and efforts to rescue her younger sister, who arrives on the very last Kindertransport. When Lisa finds out that she passed the audition, the whole hostel applauds. Then she begins the hard work of training with a master teacher to achieve her goal of becoming a concert pianist.
","This remarkable, beautifully written story is inspirational. It will provoke tears for the difficulties and deaths Lisa must face and cheers for her endurance, persistence, and passion for the music that sustains her. Readers will grow to care about Lisa and respect her devotion to her family and her music, and recognize the significance of the arts in people's lives.","Parents need to know that The Children of Willesden Lane is internationally acclaimed pianist Mona Golabek's biography of her Viennese mother, Lisa Jura Golabek. At 14, Lisa was one of more than 9,500 mostly Jewish children sent to the United Kingdom on the Kindertransport to escape Nazi persecution. There, with the help of others, Lisa was able to continue her training and pursue her ambition to become a concert pianist. Violence is always in the background and triggers the story with the brutal arrest of Lisa's father, increasing restrictions imposed on Jews in Vienna, and the Night of Broken Glass. And there's the continuous bombing of London. The only swearing is in German, and there's no sex other than kissing. (The play The Pianist of Willesden Lane is adapted from this book.)

Emmy & Oliver,Heartfelt romance about childhood BFFs reunited as teens.,"As young children, EMMY & OLIVER were neighbors, best friends, and puppy-love crushes, but everything changed when Oliver's father kidnapped him. Oliver's mother grieved but eventually remarried and had more children. Emmy's parents turned into overprotective hawks, and she was left with an Oliver-size hole in her heart. Ten years later, when Oliver is finally found, he returns to their small California hometown a completely different person -- and the worst part is he doesn't completely remember his old friends. But even after a decade, Emmy feels drawn to the boy she once called her best friend, and slowly they forge an intense but fragile bond.
","Robin Benway's coming-of-age novel is a poignant exploration of first love between two teens still coping from a traumatic childhood event. It excels both at humorous, snappy dialogue and substantive reflection on getting through emotional challenges. Although the book tackles several serious issues, Benway keeps the language and story line accessible for young adult readers. Emmy gets Oliver in a way no one else can under the circumstances, and he encourages her not to hide her ""true"" self (an avid surfer with hopes to go away for college) from her parents. He knows how devastating secrets can be nd how they distance you from those you love.
Obviously, most teens won't understand the nuances of what it means to have been kidnapped by a parent and not even know it for 10 years, but many teens will relate to the idea of divorce changing the way parents deal with you (not to mention each other) and how blended families can occasionally feel isolating to the kids from a previous marriage. And everyone, no matter how old, has felt the heartache of a beloved childhood friendship cut short by an unexpected move. What would've happened if that person had stayed or, as is the case with Oliver, returned years later? Benway is a talented writer who keeps readers engaged with this emotionally satisfying, if occasionally heartbreaking, tale about a beautiful friendship that's lost and then found.","Parents need to know that Emmy & Oliver is a contemporary realistic novel about teens who resume a friendship -- and then a relationship -- 10 years after an unexpected separation. Robin Benway's teen romance explores some tough issues (parental kidnapping, overprotective parents, coming out) but isn't too intense. There is occasional strong language (""f--k,"" ""s--t""), some passionate make-out sessions, and a few scenes of underage drinking. Mature middle schoolers and high schoolers could use it a launching pad for frank discussions with their parents about their passions, interests, and plans.

A Weekend With Wendell,Clever writing keeps this humorous tale on target.,"Three days of her cousin Wendell? How can Sophie endure it? Wendell is thoughtless, rude, and selfish. He scares her from the closet and pinches her under the breakfast table, while Sophie does her best to be polite to him. Humorous illustrations, on-target story, and clever writing make for a delightful read.
 ","Kevin Henkes excels in presenting common childhood issues within a humorous, intelligent story. Wendell behaves as a typical 5- or 6-year-old child would like to act. He does everything he wishes, with little consideration for others. And, of course, children know who's right and who's wrong. They naturally empathize with polite Sophie and see the error of Wendell's ways. One 7-year-old said Wendell ""was not being very nice. He was treating Sophie as if she wasn't important, and all people are important.""
The bright, cheerful watercolor-and-ink illustrations capture the characters' emotions, and the illustrations often add extra humor. On one page, the text reads, ""Sophie helped Wendell carry his sleeping bag and suitcase upstairs,"" and the accompanying illustration shows a boisterous Wendell zipping up the stairs empty-handed, while Sophie struggles to carry both the suitcase and the sleeping bag.","Parents need to know that their kids will find a positive role model in Sophie, but there's a bit of tit for tat in the way she ultimately retaliates against her misbehaving cousin that could send the wrong message. Still, children will identify with Sophie and cheer when she stands up for herself. Expressive and amusing illustrations, occasional tongue-in-cheek writing, and a sympathetic main character are a winning combination.

Along the way she notices things that are close to each other. She starts by saying, ""Mi cuarto está cerca de la cocina,"" a statement followed by its English translation: ""the kitchen is close to the door,"" and so on. Eventually, she reaches the house next door where her friend lives -- ""Mi amigo está cerca de mi"" (and ""my friend is close to me"").

Impossible,"Well-written, twisted fairytale has mature themes.","Seventeen-year-old Lucy Scarborough just wants to be normal high-schooler with a nice date for the prom. She wishes her mentally ill mother would stop showing up an inopportune moments to offer bizarre bits of advice, like telling her to ""Pay attention to the song. Now it's your turn."" But when Lucy is raped and ends up pregnant, her mom's warnings start making frightening sense. A variation on the folk song ""Scarborough Fair"" explains that her family has been cursed: ""If you do not perform the three tasks successfully by the time your daughter is born, then everything that has happened to your mother will happen to you. And then to your daughter."" Can Lucy, with the help of her foster parents and her devoted boyfriend, complete an evil Elfin Knight's seemingly impossible tasks before it's too late?
","Centered on the lyrics of the folk song ""Scarborough Fair,"" IMPOSSIBLE is a novel, engaging entry to the fractured-fairy-tale genre. In Werlin's version, the singer is not just a demanding lover (how exactly does one make a shirt ""without no seam nor needlework""?) but a demon who curses a woman who spurned his advances. Passed from mother to daughter, the curse's full horror dawns on Lucy as she struggles to deal with a burgeoning love interest, pregnancy, and a teen's normal push for independence.
Werlin adeptly weaves the supernatural into her modern setting, balancing magic with the realistic hardships of rape and teen pregnancy. Though the tale is not scary, the seductive Elfin Knight is a truly evil villain. The book's pace slows a bit, but picks up toward the end as Lucy and her family strive to solve the curse's puzzling tasks.","Parents need to know that while this book is a contemporary fairy tale, it has dark undercurrents, including date rape, teen pregnancy, mental illness, sexual slavery, and supernatural curses. Two young people wed very young despite parental objections; this is presented as romantic though admittedly not ideal.

"yolo: The Internet Girls, Book 4",Series friends hit college in fast-paced sequel.,"In YOLO, the friends readers have gotten to know from titles such as ttfn and l8g8r are back for more texting and instant messaging as they try to support each other through their first year of college at very different schools -- even encouraging each other to say yes to adventures that come their way, because ""you only live once."" Some of their adventures are well-tread fare, such as Zoe's long-distance boyfriend deciding to break up with her or Maddie's failure to fit in with her roommate and her friends. Meanwhile, Angela wants to go Greek but has doubts about sorority life as she encounters sexist and degrading requirements -- and even has to prevent a violent crime -- as she gets deeper into pledging.
","Yolo is a fun, fast-paced book that still will get teens thinking about what it means to be a good friend -- and about what kind of college experience they might want. (Maddie heads to a cool, public California college while Angela stays in Georgia, attending a school with a lot of Greek life; meanwhile, Zoe's in a small, liberal arts college in the Midwest.) Readers may feel that an awful lot happens to these girls before their first Thanksgiving break, some of it pretty outrageous, but, in the end, they'll be glad to see the longtime friends continue to hang in there -- and with each other -- through it all.","Parents need to know that Lauren Myracle's yolo, a book in The Internet Girls series (ttfn, l8g8r) told in texts and instant messages, is about college life and features college freshmen drinking, eating junk food, and swearing casually (including  ""f--k"" and ""s--t"") and girls calling each other ""bitch"" and ""slut.""

When Audrey Met Alice,First Daughter is akin to Alice Roosevelt in fun tale.,"Audrey's mother is the U.S. president, but, although the teen enjoys some White House perks (such as an in-house chocolate shop and advance screenings of movies), she misses her friends and the freedoms of her previous life. Even her parents aren't around very much anymore. When she discovers Alice Roosevelt's diary, she finds a surprising ally in Teddy Roosevelt's wild daughter, who tried to live life on her own terms and enjoyed shocking people. But Audrey's own antics make her parents angry, especially when she ends up in the newspaper. Even worse, her crush, Quint, stops speaking to her. How can she -- and Alice -- learn to speak their minds and be their own people, without making everyone so upset?

Even so, their similar problems of living a public life re easy to understand, and they ultimately both become more mature first daughters. Parents may want to encourage their kids to check out the author's website for additional materials, including an annotated version of Alice's fictional diary to see what was real and what wasn't.

Besides her parents (her mom's the POTUS), Audrey encounters several positive role models in the book, one of whom tells her that ""focusing on helping others almost always makes you feel better about your problems."" Over the course of the story she learns about being brave, apologizing when she's wrong, and how to speak her mind. A few uses of ""crap"" and one ""shizz.""

A Voice of Her Own: Becoming Emily Dickinson,Lovely first-person narration helps bring Dickinson to life.,"From the age of 9 through 24, Emily Dickinson's life is told as imagined by author Barbara Dane. In a close-knit family that contained a domineering, depressive father and a compliant mother, Emily tells of learning to bake, to embroider, her love of siblings, nature, and close friends. During puberty she begins to realize the restricted roles placed on women by society and strives to find a way to keep ""her own voice,"" and turns more and more to writing poems to express her feelings, large and small. She lives a privileged life that is not without illness and as a young woman begins experiencing panic attacks, which plagued her the rest of her life. She decided against becoming a born-again Christian, even as she watched her friends embrace religion; she also watches them narrow their interests to men and marriage, and perhaps it is her conviction to remain her own person that keeps her from falling in love with any available men before this biography ends.
","Dane has done a wonderful job of inhabiting Dickinson's life. She portrays her as an intelligent and loving young woman who did not see herself as anything special, but nonetheless faced obstacles such as panic attacks with determination and an unfailing appreciation of the beauty of the world around her. Readers who enjoy Jane Austen novels or historical fiction will also enjoy A VOICE OF HER OWN; readers who already love Dickinson's poetry will find her world opening up with this book.
Dane magically sprinkles some phrases used by Dickinson throughout the book, while creating new poems as Emily might have that create the same universal appeal. Author's notes include phrases from Dickinson's writing that the author included; basic facts about Dickinson, notes about the author's research, and a bibliography for further reading.","Parents need to know that although there is brief discussion between teenaged Emily and her friends about young men and what married life will be like, including intercourse, it is couched in normal and teen-appropriate language that may send today's teens into gales of laughter. Emily has vague romantic crushes, until at the age of 24 she hears a young minister preach and falls in love with him immediately, only to discover he is already married. Author notes explain that she did not meet him for years but they became close friends; and she notes that Emily also fell in love with other married men.

That brings press, cameras, and more cameras, and more truths to light than Alek is ready for. Alek now knows his best friend and confidant is really a girl, Deryn.

In addition to employing abundant dialogue, the book uses repetition of phrases and one or two challenging or unfamiliar words that may require sounding out, like the names Chirper and Quacker.
One six-year-old got as far as page five before she realized the story's inspiration. ""Hey, this is just like 'Little Red Hen'!"" Rather than being confused or discouraged, she was interested enough in the new slant on an old favorite to be willing to read the book again. This young critic liked how the pictures were ""painted softly"" (an effect illustrator Christopher Denise accomplished using colored pencils). The images, with faded edges, blend into their white backgrounds.","Parents need to know that the story is derivative of The Little Red Hen The writing, filled with dialogue and repetition, is well suited for young readers. Colored-pencil drawings are soft and endearing.

The Love That Split the World,Absorbing romance stars time-traveling smart girl.,"The summer before Natalie heads to the Ivy League from her small-town Kentucky home, she's visited by an apparition, Grandmother, who used to visit her frequently during her childhood but who's been absent for the past three years. Grandmother wants to tell her the story of the woman who fell to Earth one more time and then warns Natalie that she only has three months ""to save him."" Save who? Her father or brother? Matt, her longtime boyfriend? Or Beau, the mesmerizing boy she's never seen before but who seems to know everyone she knows? As she tries to piece the puzzle together and to find Grandmother for more answers, her world seems to be literally slipping in and out of time and place. Can THE LOVE THAT SPLIT THE WORLD also put it back together?
","This fantasy romance with multiple worlds and time travel is refreshingly grounded by the authentic voice of smart and strong Natalie, who at 18 seems to have everything going for her. But her struggles with the idea of fitting in, figuring out who she really is, and what her place in this world is make her a heroine teens will easily relate to.
The extra splash of fantasy and sci-fi might not stand up to the scrutiny of hard-core genre fans, but they add an intriguing element to a story that could, in less adept hands, easily bog down in standard-romance cliché. The First Nation stories told by Grandmother add a nice combination of whimsy and depth and encourage readers to think about why we need stories and why we think about them the way we do.","Parents need to know that The Love That Split the World is a time-traveling fantasy romance with a strong heroine who's a great role model for adopted kids, especially Native American kids adopted into white families. Smart, strong, and lovingly supported by a family that encourages her to explore her biological heritage, protagonist Natalie will get kids thinking about wanting to fit in. There's a lot of teen drinking, and they're very matter-of-fact about it. Some teens show alcoholic tendencies, and the consequences of driving drunk are shown when one teen ends up in a coma. There's lots of kissing -- the novel is first and foremost a romance -- along with some light making out but no graphic descriptions. Blood's mentioned in a recurring nightmare and on injuries after a couple of fistfights. Many First Nation stories are told;  couple include mentions of murder or a scary skeleton that eats people, and they all provide food for thought about our place in the world and how we learn from hearing our people's stories. The book will encourage teens to think about time travel, multiple universes, our place in the world, love, loyalty, friendship, and more.

Babar the King,Elephant monarch establishes kingly credentials.,"Rome wasn't built in a day, but it seems Celesteville practically is when Babar leads the other elephants in constructing a capital city and creating a pleasant and well-ordered civilization. But into every idyll some misfortune must fall, and lessons are be learned on the road to ultimate happiness.
 ","Jean de Brunhoff uses simple, direct language that communicates understanding and acceptance of life as it happens. There is much to observe in Babar's story: He picks a happy, beautiful spot to build his city, which concerns the fish there, but other animals smooth the way. The elephants work industriously and enjoy the fruits of their labor. In a reminder of how the world should work, they each pick jobs that will aid others.
Ever mindful of a child's concerns, de Brunhoff includes in Babar's worried, restless night a disturbing dream that nevertheless foretells that everything will turn out right. Kids process ideas in books wisely and alertly, and de Brunhoff has respect for these qualities. Knowing he was dying of tuberculosis, he wished to pass on to his own children an unflinching sense of tragedy and triumph, responsibility and acquiescence. His graceful vision makes you long to have met him, but at least through his books, another generation can fall under his sway.","Parents need to know that the characteristically detailed artwork blends with a story that is engrossing even by today's standards.

Golem,Giant legend too heady and scary for little ones.,"To combat the persecution of the Jews in Prague, the chief rabbi creates a powerful giant of clay (the Golem). The Golem looks on him as a father, and does all he can to help the Jews fight their enemies. End notes develop the legend further and tell the history of the persecution and repression of Jews.
","The multi-layered cut-paper illustrations of GOLEM are magnificent, and are a good enough reason to own this book. They're definitely the reason it won the Caldecott medal in 1997. The pages with the intricately cut clouds and mist are particularly impressive. Throughout, David Wisniewski has manipulated Color-Aid, coral, and bark paper to create this haunting adaptation of this somewhat scary and sad Jewish legend.
The story here has been simplified, which makes it more accessible to young readers. However, they may not be the appropriate audience. Readers should be old enough to learn about the persecution of the Jews, accept that a man (even the holiest of rabbis) could create a giant from clay, understand why the giant was heroic for his violent overthrow of the oppressors, and most importantly, get why the rabbi has to return the Golem to earth even as the monster pleads, like a child to his father, that he wants to live. Readers who are ready for this story might be better served by Isaac Bashevis Singer's longer, more complete, and richer version, also called The Golem.","Parents need to know that though this book won the Caldecott Medal in 1997, usually reserved for lighter picture books, it contains images that may frighten young children. Also, the story, which is an adaptation of a medieval legend, may unsettle them. It discusses the persecution of the Jews in Prague and shows the violent way the Golem dispatches enemies. More sophisticated readers will find the book more captivating and inspiring, though still somewhat distressing, especially when the Golem is destroyed.

Heather Has Two Mommies,Lively illustrations add charm to inclusion classic.,"HEATHER HAS TWO MOMMIES. She lives happily with Mama Kate, a doctor, and Mama Jane, a carpenter, plus dog Midnight and cat Gingersnap, with work, play, and lots of fun. When she goes to her first day of ""school"" (more like preschool), another kid asks about her dad, which is a first. This leads teacher Ms. Molly to have each kid make a picture of his or her own family, and to say that while all families are different, what matters is that the people in them love each other.
","Many years after its controversial debut, this updated version of a now-classic tale of a little girl with same-sex parents comes across as a sweet, gentle message of inclusion and acceptance. Laura Cornell's bright, lively illustrations add a lot of visual appeal to Lesléa Newman's quiet celebration of loving family life.","Parents need to know that Heather Has Two Mommies is an updated, somewhat revised 25th anniversary edition of Lesléa Newman's book, which stirred controversy in 1990 for its matter-of-fact portrayal of a same-sex couple and their 3-year-old. For the most part, this is a book about happy family life and what to expect at preschool, brought to life in Laura Cornell's colorful, appealing illustrations. At Heather's preschool, there are all kinds of different families -- two mommies, two daddies, one of each, step-parents, a grandparent raising a child, siblings and no siblings, and so on. And, as preschool teacher Ms. Molly says, the important thing about a family is that all the people in it love each other.

The Graveyard Book,Tale of boy raised by ghosts is both creepy and warmhearted.,"On the night Jack murders a family in their beds, their toddler runs out into the night, pursued by the murderer, and finds his way into a cemetery. The ghosts there chase away the murderer and, after much argument, decide to raise the boy. They name him Nobody, Bod for short. As long as Bod stays in the cemetery they can protect him from Jack, who is still searching for him. But a growing boy, even one who is granted the Freedom of the Graveyard, eventually needs contact with the living world -- and it is the world of the living that holds the most danger for Bod.
","It may seem odd to say it, but this is a lovely book. Suspenseful, yes, and a bit creepy, but lovely nonetheless. Author Neil Gaiman has learned a thing or two since his entry into children's books. His acclaimed first novel, Coraline was clever and technically proficient, but lacked heart, as did Stardust. This one has it in spades, and in the strangest places.
Gaiman begins with one of the great opening sentences (""There was a hand in the darkness, and it held a knife""), and quickly introduces a very relatable protagonist, a boy who grows from 18 months to 15 or so years, increasing his power and confidence but retaining the innocence of one who doesn't know the world. He gives him touching relationships with his ghostly parents and vampiric guardian, and though he has some scary adventures with ghouls and snake-like tomb guards, the graveyard world is never nearly as frightening as that of the living, especially to a boy who has been raised there. By adding a bit of heart and soul to his already brilliant writing, Gaiman has raised his game considerably.","Parents need to know that this is mildly creepy with a bit of violence, suspense, and menace, including a man who murders a family and tries to murder a toddler and a teen boy and girl.

A Long Walk to Water,"Touching take on Lost Boys of Sudan, based on true story.","A LONG WALK TO WATER is two interlocking stories, taking place in Sudan more than 20 years apart. In the first, 11-year-old Salva runs into the bush when his village is attacked during the civil war. He spends years walking to overcrowded refugee camps in bordering countries, seeing friends and family die at the hands of armed men as well as from attacks by a lion and crocodiles, wondering if he will ever see his parents or siblings again. In the other story, 11-year-old Nya spends her days collecting water for her family, often making two trips a day to a dirty pond. When strange men arrive in her village, they begin working on a project that could not only change her daily duties but also her life.  ","A Long Walk to Water is a short book, but it packs quite an emotional wallop. Readers will have no trouble empathizing with Salva, who suffers incredible hardship when a war drives him from his home. They'll also be impressed by his strong will, which helps him not only survive a terrible circumstance but also return to help the people still suffering in Sudan. Author Linda Sue Park doesn't gloss over the gory details -- a child is eaten by a lion, and Salva watches his uncle get shot to death -- but she doesn't dwell on them, either, making this book an appropriate choice for tweens. Some of the saddest moments come when Salva remembers the family he's separated from, including his father, who would sometimes ride home on his bicycle with mangoes wedged in his spokes. Readers not only get a look the historical tragedy that took place in Sudan but also, through Nya's story, learn how much work continues to be needed in that region of the world. ","Parents need to know A Long Walk to Water by Newbery Medal-winning author Linda Sue Park (A Single Shard) blends fact and fiction to tell a story of the civil war in Sudan (1983–2005), in which more than 20,000 so-called Lost Boys became displaced and/or orphaned. There are bombings, burnings, and people with guns and machetes. Protagonist Salva, who's 11 when his story begins in 1995, knows that sometimes boys are forced to fight. Walking from his village to a refugee camp, he suffers greatly from thirst and hunger. His friend's eaten by a lion, he sees people who have died from dehydration in the desert, and he watches his uncle get shot to death. Another man is hit in the head with the butt of a gun. A boy is shot and another is killed by a crocodile after refugees are forced in the water by soldiers -- 1,000 refugees die that day. Readers will learn through the alternating story of Nya, an 11-year-old Sudanese girl in 2008, about people trying to solve problems in that country after the civil war, some with nonprofits that come to build wells in villages, and they learn how fresh water can lead to schools, markets, and more.

Skink -- No Surrender,"Teens join bizarre, one-eyed vigilante in wacky adventure.","Fourteen-year-old cousins Richard and Malley have been BFFs practically since birth and make it their business to protect the eggs of nesting sea turtles near their Florida home -- which is why Richard senses trouble when Malley first doesn't show up for turtle-watching and then proceeds to tell him one obvious lie after another by phone and text. But, while he's on the beach looking for Malley, he meets the surreal Clint Tyree, protagonist of numerous Carl Hiaasen novels, who despite his strange appearance (one-eyed, bearded, and sporting a flowered shower cap -- and that's just for starters) proves to be a man of many resources. This comes in handy as the duo hits the road in search of Malley -- who, it turns out, has decided to avoid her parents' plan to send her to boarding school by running off with some ""soul mate"" she met on the Internet and is now sending Richard cries for help disguised as sunny travel reports.
","This book is not going to be every reader's dish. The main character is a crazed-looking hero with bird beaks and other strange objects in his matted beard, a fondness for eating roadkill, and a habit of popping out whatever's serving as a replacement for his missing eye. Also, the teen protagonists' ill-advised decisions are enough to make any parent's blood run cold.
But best-selling author Hiaasen's storytelling skills and trademark exuberant weirdness with a strong moral compass will keep adventure fans cracking up as they turn the pages in SKINK: NO SURRENDER -- and pick up a few life lessons along the way. ","Parents need to know that Carl Hiaasen's Skink -- No Surrender, involves plenty of violence, but much of it is presented as improbably cartoonish. There's gunplay, kidnapping, death by alligator, and attempted murder as 14-year-old Richard tries to save his cousin from the guy she met on the Internet. The author's first book for the teen audience offers Hiaasen staples galore, from Skink, the one-eyed superhero/former (and allegedly deceased) governor, to lots of Florida local color and environmental messages. Characters, especially teens, show colossally bad judgment with dire consequences, such as 14-year-old Malley running off with her online soul mate and discovering he's a mean thug with sex on his mind. Despite the lurid events, numerous perils, and gleeful use of gross-out (much of it having to do with whatever's serving as Skink's missing eye at the moment), evil has a way of getting its comeuppance, and good values, crafty thinking, and good connections often save the day.

Sure Signs of Crazy,Unforgettable story of girl moving beyond her tragic past.,"The summer she turns 12, Sarah Nelson is still defined by her tragic past: Her mother, Jane, is prison for drowning her twin brother and trying to kill Sarah when the siblings were 2. Her alcoholic father relocates Sarah whenever the locals discover who they are. Lonely and secretive, Sarah has two diaries -- one real, one fake -- and writes letters to Atticus Finch, the lawyer dad in To Kill a Mockingbird. Her best friend is a plant, and she's worried she'll end up crazy like her mom. Sarah wants this summer to be different: She wants to fall in love, understand what the big deal is about kissing, be acknowledged as her own person, and have friends.

 Much like Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird, Sarah is a precocious, charming misfit trying to understand an often disappointing world. In SURE SIGNS OF CRAZY, Karen Harrington tips her hat to Harper Lee's classic while creating her own memorable heroine. It's a heartrending story that manages to avoid sentimentality. In many ways Sarah's a typical preteen: She's obsessed with piercing her ears and wants to be cool and sophisticated, and to fall in love, whatever that really means. Though she's clever and wise beyond her years, she's just as awkward and insecure as the next 12-year-old. ","Parents need to know that Sure Signs of Crazy is written from the perspective of a 12-year-old girl whose mentally ill mother killed her twin brother and tried to kill her when they were toddlers. Sarah's father is an alcoholic who means well but can only be counted on to let her down. Sarah snoops, lies, and steals, but not maliciously.

Lady Muck,Unusual settings and challenging language.,"William Mayne's tale of two greedy but likable pigs delights in imaginative wordplay. The hungry porkers get their just desserts through a series of misadventures that alternate between low and clever humor. Jonathan Heale's handsome artwork lends a fairy-tale feeling to the story and shows off the principal characters' eccentricity.
 ","Jonathan Heale's woodblock illustrations are captivating, but it's William Mayne's writing that grabs the reader with its playfulness. He turns the words as if they're on a lathe, shaping them to fit: ""Go snuffly and diggy fat sweet rooties,"" says the sneaky Sowk. ""That will happy me, Boark, my Boarky dear, from grunt to squeal."" The pure joy of language is always present. And that joy is infectious: A class of 8-year-olds barked with laughter when they heard words like firkle and potatio, and then they made up their own words.
The watercolors, together with the woodcuts, keep the story flowing along.

Goodnight Moon,Ultimate going-to-bed book has stood the test of time.,"As a fire crackles in the fireplace and the moon rises in a wintry night sky outside the windows of his bedroom, a young rabbit settles down for the night. An old lady rabbit rocks quietly in a nearby chair knitting, mittens dry in front of the fire, two kittens tumble on the carpet, and a mouse peeks out. The room grows gradually dimmer as the rabbit says goodnight to each object in his room and outside the window, then falls asleep at last.
","The rhythm is slow and calming, the rhymes are soft, the ritual of bidding good night to the familiar objects in the room is appealing. For more than 65 years this has been the ultimate going-to-bed book, the first book parents share with their children, the book kids ask for again and again, and the one parents don't mind reading again and again. It's easy to see why -- author Margaret Wise Brown and illustrator Clement Hurd do everything right. The pictures are full of interesting details -- the paintings hanging on the wall in bunny's room are of scenes from another Brown-Hurd collaboration, The Runaway Bunny.

Lu had every expectation that her father the emperor would name her as his successor, even though their kingdom had never had a female ruler before. Instead, the emperor announced that Lu would marry her disgraced cousin Set, and that Set would be emperor. Lu's whole world and all her hopes for the future came crumbling down in that moment. Princess Lu's fight to regain her rightful place will take her to the far reaches of the empire, and she'll have to confront, outwit, defeat, or recruit forces of darkness and power beyond her wildest imaginings.
","First-time author Mimi Yu's Asian-inspired magical fantasy has lots of action, adventure, and violence. Yu's world-building and character development in The Girl King are solid and believable. Action scenes are exciting and easy to follow. Descriptions of places paint adequate pictures but don't quite have enough spark to be truly vivid. Genuine surprises in the plot re few, but the actoin and adventure keep the pages turning.
Teens will relate to Lu and Nok as they each deal with losing all their hopes and expectations for the future, and have to learn how to make their futures happen on their own.

Animals are in danger and there are some descriptions of animals killing and being killed. Sexual content is mild, with a few kisses and a couple of brief descriptions of caressing under clothes; no sensitive body parts are mentioned. A girl's first period is very scary to her and mentions contractions and blood spilling out. A character was addicted to the opiate-like ""poppy tears"" in the past, and it's mentioned that an adult character smokes the banned substance ""poppy tar."" Teens drink wine and hard alcohol a couple of times with negative consequences mentioned. Strong language is very rare but includes ""s--t"" and ""bitch.""

Together they face off against the mysterious Mr. Quincrux, who has the ability to enter minds and control people from the inside. Shreve and Jack decide they must to escape the center, and their journey toward freedom will take them through some increasingly dark and scary territory.
","The Twelve-Fingered Boy is gripping from start to finish, an intense horror/action story that finds new juice in familiar situations. The book has echoes of The Matrix, X-Men and the novels of Stephen King, but author John Hornor Jacobs makes sure those influences don't overwhelm his own voice. Shreve and Jack are very compelling characters, and Jacobs ends the novel in such a way that readers will be anxious to get their hands on the saga's next installment.","Parents need to know that The Twelve-Fingered Boy is an intense horror adventure with compelling characters that adds a creepy note to the notion of superpowers. It has a number of very violent scenes, some of which sensitive readers may find disturbing (a bloody fight between inmates at a juvenile detention center, a gunfight, a stabbing, in which a teen character is gravely injured, an adbuction and imprisonment of a girl by a presumed pedophile). Perhaps more disturbing than the physical violence is the mental ""rape"" that happens when the villains take over the bodies and minds of their victims. There's little sexual content, and objectionable language generally ranges from ""titty-baby"" to ""damn,"" ""hell,"" ""bitch,"" and ""bastard.""

Still traumatized by the bizarre disappearance of his younger sister five years ago, Mulder is determined to rescue the latest victim before she is killed. Assisted by Gimble, his best friend at his new school, and by Phoebe, his longtime crush from his old home, Mulder matches wits with a serial murderer and looks for connections to his missing sister.

Hero Mom,Simple book has positive message for kids of military moms.,"In HERO MOM, a diverse range of children discuss how proud they are of their military moms and the ways in which the women resemble heroes or superheroes for their courage and skill during deployment.
","Hero Mom takes a difficult subject -- family separation during deployment -- and presents it as a point of pride for children. Kids can explain to others that their mothers are gone but are doing something extremely important, whether they're transporting cargo, repairing aircraft, or leading a battalion. The book makes a point of showing the way moms who are deployed show love for their children with letters or by email or video chat. And the soft watercolor illustrations give the book an expressive, sentimental feel.

For parents, this can be a way to broach a tender subject and open up a dialogue about managing the separation.","Parents need to know that Hero Mom is a picture book geared toward the children of enlisted servicewomen who are absent due to deployment.

The Prince and the Dressmaker,"Charming, cross-dressing prince breaks the fairy tale mold.","In THE PRINCE AND THE DRESSMAKER, Prince Sebastian of Belgium is in Paris for the social season, where he discovers Frances, a young, talented seamstress and fashion designer laboring away in an obscure tailor shop. With the promise of decent pay and a chance to make her own designs, Sebastian convinces Frances to join his staff at the palace. There Frances discovers Sebastian's deepest secret: Sometimes he likes to wear women's clothes. Frances doesn't care what Sebastian wears, as long as she can keep designing and sewing. As her friendship with Sebastian deepens into something possibly more, Frances realizes she can't keep hiding her talent behind Sebastian's secret forever and decides to leave. Now, without his best friend at his side, or the freedom and empowerment that come from going out as Lady Crystallia, will Sebastian cave to royal pressure and finally marry a princess he doesn't love?
","Talented illustrator Jen Wang has written a lively, engaging, and mold-breaking take on the classic fairy tale with the poor girl who meets Prince Charming. In The Prince and the Dressmaker, we're given a prince with a difference nd a poor girl with the strength of character to know that she doesn't deserve to live in another person's shadow. Wang's colorful and animated drawings move the story along well and effectively show lots of different moods and emotions as we're asked why what the prince wears matters and given lots of food for thought about hiding our true selves from our loved ones, and from the world at large.

Isle of the Lost: The Graphic Novel,Disney villain-kids tale gets fast-paced graphic revamp.,"Years ago, all the villains of the Disney world were exiled to THE ISLE OF THE LOST, enclosed with a magic bubble to keep them away from the good people of Auradon. With dark surroundings and worse parental role models, Mal (daughter of Maleficent), Jay (son of Jafar), Carlos (son of Cruella de Vil), and Evie (daughter of Evil Queen) are fine with being bad. It's expected. But somehow they're never as evil, thieving, self-absorbed, or vain as their parents want them to be, either. Mal's mean trick on Evie launches a series of events that could help restore evil to world domination, and also win their parents' approval.
","This addition to Disney's villain-kids franchise may be the best yet, with spare, cut-to-the-chase dialogue, vivid, engaging art, and not a lot of padding or nonsense on the side.

When 16-year-old Art meets Zee, he knows she's magic, even if she can't see it herself, and he's determined to show her. As the story moves on, the two form a powerful and beautiful connection as they unpack the complexities of gender, sexuality, and identity.

When Sidonia is summoned by the insane Emperor to appear at his court, Nemesis must take her place to protect her. Practically invincible in battle, Nemesis still miscalculates the treachery of the Emperor and his family. In order to save herself and her beloved, she must learn to temper her killer instincts with kindness and empathy.
","Questions of nature vs. nurture play out in unexpected and entertaining ways in this stand-alone sci-fi tale of a futuristic killing machine who grows a heart. With The Diabolic, author S.J. Kincaid does a first-rate job of setting up plot twists and executing them with precision. Her characters -- from Nemesis to the future emperor Tyrus to Sidonia -- are offbeat and well developed, and her depiction of intrigue in a galactic empire is nuanced.

Nobody Likes a Goblin,Outcast goblin proves courageous in mythic adventure.,"In NOBODY LIKES A GOBLIN, Goblin starts his day by lighting torches, feeding rats, and gnawing on an old boot for breakfast. When he goes to visit his best friend, Skeleton, in the Treasure Room, a marauding band of ""adventurers"" storm the dungeon to plunder the treasure. Goblin isn't naturally courageous -- he hides quaking under his bed until the intruders leave -- but when he discovers that they took Skeleton as well, he puts on Skeleton's crown and sets off to find him. His journey takes him past his troll neighbor, whom he vows to help, and he's chased by a farmer with a pitchfork and an inn full of elves, who call him ""a filthy goblin"" and ""a disgusting little goblin."" With the help of a cave full of other goblins who see his crown and assume he's their king, Goblin saves Skeleton and others and chases off those who would harm them.
","With beautifully detailed fairy tale art and a lowly but lovable goblin as hero, this picture book takes the reader on a captivating adventure that celebrates friendship and pluck. The fantasy world is unusual for a picture book, Goblin is cute and appealing, and the book celebrates and rewards his admirable character traits. The story's also laced with light humor. When the cave of goblins see his crown and ask Goblin if he's Goblin King, ""Goblin thought a moment. 'Yes,' he said. 'Yes, I am.'""
Some elements might be scary or jarring for younger readers: a skeleton, fierce chases, and some ugly name-calling. A buxom female captive in a low-cut blouse and skirt is shown chained on a cart carrying the dventurers' spoils, but later she chases her captors. The book serves as a rich and friendly introduction to fantasy, transporting young readers to an imagined world and to the sort of story they'll devour when they're older.","Parents need to know that Nobody Likes a Goblin is a medieval fantasy by author/illustrator Ben Hatke, best known for graphic novels that skew young (Zita the Spacegirl series), so it's not surprising that this picture book fantasy world is richly drawn and described. Though Goblin's reviled by both humans and elves, he's pictured as a cute, likable character who displays admirable qualities -- loyalty, courage, and perseverance -- as he treks off to save his friend Skeleton. There's some name-calling (""filthy goblin,"" ""disgusting little goblin""), sword-wielding thieves, a skeleton, ghosts, and a chase with a pitchfork. There's one image of a captured woman on a cart (part of the adventurers' spoils) restrained by chains around her waist, though she's later shown victorious, chasing her captors.

When Spring Comes,"Gorgeous, poetic chronicle of spring's slow blossoming.","Before spring, trees are starkly black, grass is brown, and gardens are bare dirt. But if you wait, leaves and blossom burst forth, the grass revives, and green shoots emerge from the soil. There's plenty of rain, too, and sometimes even snow. Eventually spring settles in for good, and the world is bursting with color and life ... and then you'll need to wait for summer.
","Spring is a teasing season, unfurling in fits and starts and testing our patience -- and that's part of its charm, as the talented husband-and-wife team of Kevin Henkes and Laura Dronzek point out. WHEN SPRING COMES showcases Henkes' poetic eye for detail along with Dronzek's vibrant, gorgeous acrylic paintings. Double-page spreads show a snowman melting away, kittens frolicking in spring grass, and children and animals savoring the warming weather. As always, Henkes writes with a kindly, good-humored voice. Daffodils bob like miniature suns on one page and on the next bend under the weight of a springtime snow: Spring, Henkes notes, ""changes its mind a lot."" Spring involves a lot of waiting, but the journey is to be savored -- much like this book. It's a perfect companion to the couple's Birds and Henkes' Waiting and My Garden.","Parents need to know that When Spring Comes is an observant, beautifully illustrated collaboration by two acclaimed figures in children's books, author Kevin Henkes and illustrator Laura Dronzek.

Natasha is the first sister to make her three wishes. The first wish is an impossible wish. The second is a wish she can make come true herself. The third is the ""deepest wish of her secret heart."" Natasha is then to observe whether or not these wishes come true. The kids of Willow Hill are like kids in other towns, except they give reverence to the ancient, supposedly magical willow tree. There are crushes at school, lots of bouncy dialogue, popular kids, and kids who feel invisible. Natasha, Darya, nd Eva's mother left them in the care of their aunts and their father, a dreamy-eyed lute maker. Whether Natasha's wishes will come true remains to be seen, but there are deeper family mysteries to be solved in this series start. ","This emotionally charged fantasy could have used more magic, but the fact that girls are the ones who can be given magic makes it a positive story for and about girls. And there's a mystery beneath the magic that will surely be explored in the other books in the series. But some readers might get discouraged by the lack of the shivery coincidence that makes magic feel real or the shimmery gloss of stepping into another world. And it lacks the storyteller's grace -- and the deep friendships and rivalry -- that, for example, the Harry Potter series radiates. Instead, Natasha reports being pulled ""completely away from the real world by a memory."" And platitudes sprinkled throughout the story serve to distract, such as when Natasha says to a love interest, ""It's hard to know what you really want sometimes, you know what I mean?"" An interesting character, the Bird Lady, appears and disappears, intrigues and confuses Natasha. But she delivers an important message when she states that ""it's the girls who are full of magic."" Hopefully the second book in the series will get down to the business of magic nd deliver by giving the Blok sisters something really enchanting to hold onto.

Though there's nothing edgy or scary about this series start, the sisters are dealing with the mysterious disappearance of their mother and some otherworldly occurrences. Tweenage crushes and sibling rivalry take center stage more than the magic. And an obsession with beauty that's woven into the sibling rivalry scratches t Natasha's self-worth. Kids who are hoping to be swept away by a fantasy story might be disappointed to find that there's more family lore here than a magical journey.

The First Part Last,A realistic look at being a teen parent.,"Award-winning author Johnson trains her poetic prose on two secondary characters from her previous novel, Heaven.
	In alternating Now and Then chapters, 16-year-old Bobby tells about his girlfriend, Nia's, pregnancy, and his life as sole parent of their baby daughter, Feather, after he refuses to give her up for adoption. He relates his feelings of love and exhaustion, and of missing his childhood and friends, who don't really understand him anymore.
","Angela Johnson deftly manages a delicate balancing act in this book. She doesn't gloss over the difficulties of teen parenting, but she also highlights the joy and love that are just as much a part of raising a baby as diapers and lack of sleep.
Bobby, the only fleshed-out character in the story, is an unusually sweet teen, fully open to the emotions of fatherhood, and willing to do whatever it takes to do the right thing. His family -- divorced parents and older brother -- are all kind and understanding, though unwilling to remove any of the burden from his shoulders. This may make the whole situation seem a bit unreal, but it does focus the reader's attention on the problems that come with the territory, rather than any trumped up by the author for the sake of conflict. It's a simple, gentle way of dealing with a complicated, difficult issue.","Parents need to know that this is an award-winning book about teen parenthood, told from the father's point of view. Teen parenthood is not glamorized. Bobby and Nia must navigate their way through a very tough road of their own making.  This book is told in lyrical language that will capture teens, as will the compelling subject matter. Some parents may find  attitude toward underage sex is too casual, as shown when Bobby and Nia have sex again after she becomes pregnant. Nevertheless, it's a realistic look at being a teen parent.

She dies not long after giving birth to their son, and, after a giant ape kills Lord Greystoke, Kala, a female ape who's recently lost her baby, adopts the infant and calls him ""Tarzan,"" ""white skin"" in the ape language. As Tarzan grows, he's torn between the world of the apes and the secrets of the shoreline cottage where he was born, though he doesn't know this. The conflict only grows more intense when another crew of nautical no-goodniks abandon their passengers -- including an absent-minded American professor and his spirited daughter, Jane -- on the beach.
","Readers who come to the original from one of the much-sanitized Hollywood versions may be startled to discover a Tarzan tale that's more Quentin Tarantino than Walt Disney. Written for the dult pulp-fiction audience of 1912, TARZAN OF THE APES offers plenty of imaginative adventure, an intriguing premise, and the start of one of pop culture's most notable romances. From the 21st-century viewpoint, it also delivers shocking racist stereotypes (both of African ""blacks"" and of Jane's cartoonishly useless servant, a ""Negress""), lots of gleeful violence, and hilariously improbable plot developments (such as Tarzan teaching himself to read from the children's books his parents left behind). It's a classic adventure nd one that's likely to lead to some interesting discussions of what the moviemakers chose to leave out or change -- nd why.","Parents need to know that Tarzan of the Apes, the 1912 book by Edgar Rice Burroughs that launched a pop-cultural empire, is a thrilling page-turner with a minefield on nearly every one of its 400 pages. Murder and mayhem abound, as humans and animals kill each other, as well as members of their own species, with gusto. And there are cannibals. Tarzan himself is fond of snaring members of a jungle tribe with a noose, strangling them, and dropping their bodies from treetops; vengeful soldiers wipe out a village; seafaring scalawags hack and bludgeon one another to death. There are also plentiful, outmoded stereotypes, especially regarding gender roles and race. There's more innuendo about primeval behavior than actual lurid detail in the Tarzan-Jane romance, which involves numerous rescues but only one scene of intense kissing (it ends quickly and leads to much internal conflict).

In danger of being killed, Ruby has been hiding the true nature of her powers for years. When given the chance to escape, she takes it, only to discover she's a pawn in a more complicated game. She eventually meets up with three other travelers searching for a rumored safe haven, but even her best friends won't be able to protect her when she's forced to make a terrible choice.
","Plenty of books feature kids with superpowers, but this one has an intensity that raises it above many others. The Darkest Minds is set in a near-future dystopia that feels fresh and interesting. The characters are multidimensional, especially Ruby, Liam, and Chubs.

"Never Caught, the Story of Ona Judge: George and Martha Washington's Courageous Slave Who Dared to Run Away; Young Readers Edition",Riveting bio is a great resource for teaching about slavery.,"NEVER CAUGHT, THE STORY OF ONA JUDGE: GEORGE AND MARTHA WASHINGTON'S COURAGEOUS SLAVE WHO RAN AWAY; YOUNG READERS EDITION is middle-grade novelist Kathleen Van Cleeve's tween-friendly daptation of the 2017 nonfiction National Book Award finalist Never Caught: The Washingtons' Relentless Pursuit of Their Runaway Slave, Ona Judge, written by historian Erica Armstrong Dunbar. Based on Dunbar's extensive archival research, the co-authors have produced a detailed biography of a remarkable woman, Ona Maria Judge, who was born into slavery on George and Martha Washington's famed Mount Vernon plantation around 1773 and ran away from America's most famous family in 1796, while Washington was president. Ona's youth coincides with the adolescence of the new United States, and her life alongside the president's family gives her an up-close and personal view of the turbulent politics and complicated social life of the nation's most prominent individuals. After taking the enormous risk of ""stealing away"" from the Washingtons, Ona is able to evade slave-catchers and make an independent life for herself in New Hampshire, although she remains in poverty -- and, legally speaking, a fugitive -- for the rest of her life. While this ""Young Readers"" edition emphasizes Ona's bravery and resilience more than George Washington's ""relentless pursuit"" of her that Dunbar details in her academic version for adult readers, the Washingtons nd George's fellow ""founding fathers"" are nevertheless shown to be complicit -- if conflicted -- supporters of slavery.
","This riveting biography brings Ona to life as a conflicted young woman trying to survive through incredibly difficult circumstances. Her proximity to the Washingtons llows the authors an opportunity to explain complicated historical events and laws like the Fugitive Slave Law, the Three-Fifths Compromise in the U.S. Constitution, and the precarious situation of free black Americans in the early republic. The writing in this adaptation for young readers is mostly clear and compelling, though there are a few surprising instances in which the attempt to explain a complex historical phenomenon winds up oversimplifying, distorting, or slightly misrepresenting the facts. For instance, one misstatement claims that after the Revolutionary War, black loyalists were ""completely abandoned"" by the British, when in fact thousands were evacuated, many were given land grants in places like Nova Scotia and the Caribbean, and more than 1,000 wound up relocating to the newly established colony of Sierra Leone. While it's true that many black Loyalists were not fortunate enough to flee with the British armies, and those who were left behind did indeed face repression, small errors such as this do a slight disservice to an otherwise incredibly educational nd rigorously reconstructed work of history.
Still, Never Caught, the Story of Ona Judge is a fantastic window into the successes nd struggles of free and enslaved people of color in this period. It also deals frankly with some of the ugliest truths about America's founding and the deeply flawed men credited with its creation.","Parents need to know that Never Caught, The Story of Ona Judge: George and Martha Washington's Courageous Slave Who Dared to Run Away is a fact-filled, tween-friendly biography of a fascinating historical figure. This Young Readers Edition of historian Erica Armstrong Dunbar's Never Caught for adults is an excellent resource for teaching and learning about slavery in the early United States and the lives of enslaved women. The book is compelling in terms of storytelling and rich in detailed information about the period. No acts of violence are described, but there are frank discussions about how vulnerable enslaved individuals were to kidnapping, brutal punishment, and sexual assault, with explicit references to rape.

The Carpet People,Funny fantasy about tiny rug folk a wry satire of leaders.,"After the mysterious force known as the Fray destroys their home, a band of tiny, intrepid Munrungs sets off across the Carpet in search of safety and civilization. They encounter all kinds of opponents and obstacles, from treacherous mouls and fierce snargs to the mysterious wights who claim to remember the future. Each step of the way, the Munrungs wonder whether there's a better way to rule themselves and deal with their enemies.
","Originally written when the author was 17 and updated almost three decades later, THE CARPET PEOPLE retains some adolescent awkwardness. Narrated at a distance and lacking a single, unifying protagonist, the tale might not fully engage some readers. There's plenty of good-natured humor and wry musings on the nature of government and leadership, though. Aspiring writers also can study the story's earliest version, a 12-part serial that first appeared in Terry Pratchett's hometown newspaper.","Parents need to know that The Carpet People is an agreeable, humorous fantasy adventure written by a 17-year-old Terry Pratchett and revised by the author nearly 30 years later. It doesn't exhibit the storytelling dexterity of Pratchett's later work, but it presents a highly imaginative vision of what life might be like at a microscopic level within a carpet. Although there are battle and fight scenes, the level of violence is low, and there's no objectionable language.

A Girl Called Fearless,Compelling heroine drives gripping dystopian thriller.,"A GIRL CALLED FEARLESS presents an alternative present-day Los Angeles in which almost all women of child-bearing age have died in the past few years when a hormone that causes ovarian cancer is widely given to beef cattle. Under the guise of protecting the few remaining women and young girls, a movement called the Paternalists has come to power and implemented strict controls that prevent women from seeing the news, managing their own money, and getting an education. When 16-year-old Avie's father arranges her marriage to an older man she's never met, Avie reluctantly decides her only chance at freedom is to escape to Canada. Along the way she learns that the Paternalist movement goes deeper into the government than anyone knew and that they have even more plans to control women's lives. As a witness who could bring down the movement, Avie's run to freedom becomes a run for her life when she realizes they'll do anything to silence her.
","Catherine Linka's debut novel is a gripping political thriller. Heroine Avie's narrative voice is mature, believable, and compelling for teens and adults alike. Teens will easily relate to Avie's struggle for independence and the ability to decide her own future, and they'll admire her bravery and root for her as she makes her way to freedom.
The plot is well constructed and compelling, building to an exciting climax and hopeful ending. But the real strength of the novel is the way it'll get teens thinking about how to protect an individual's right to make her own decisions and about the balance of power between men and women in society. It's one of those rare accomplishments that raises important issues without being preachy, gets kids thinking, and entertains and thrills along the way.","Parents need to know that A Girl Called Fearless is a gripping political thriller set in an alternative present that will get teens thinking about gender roles and discrimination; the importance of personal freedom and self-determination; and the safety of the nation's food supply. Some harsh realities of the male-dominated society include the restriction of women's access to information, education, and money; teen girls being instructed that they'll have to ""do it"" whenever their husbands want; and a teen girl setting herself on fire in protest on the steps of the capitol building. Main character Avie (nicknamed Fearless) is not really unafraid, but she finds the bravery she needs to escape her oppressors and help remove them from power. Strong language is infrequent and includes a few instances of ""s--t,"" ""ass,"" and ""bitch."" Violence also is infrequent and vague, except the killing of a goat is described in some detail. A major character is shot, but it's not gory. Avie and Yates kiss and make out a few times but decide to wait to have sex because Avie doesn't feel ready for it.

Boy: Tales of Childhood,Dahl autobiography focuses on nasty school days.,"Roald Dahl's anecdotal autobiography focuses mostly on his unpleasant experiences at three schools. Between ages 7 nd 9, Dahl attended school in his Welsh hometown, where he and his friends declared war on the neighborhood sweetshop witch and were roundly caned by the schoolmaster. Attempting to save her son from such beatings, his mother sent him across the Channel to boarding school, where conditions were even worse and the boys had only each other in a world of authoritarian and often violent schoolmasters. At 13, he was graduated to Repton, where his athletic abilities and his size shielded him slightly from the general atmosphere of persecution, though he makes it clear that the headmaster was a genuine sadist. In this last section, Dahl also looks forward in time to his coming adventures in Africa, and allows himself some observations about how his childhood experiences shaped his later life.
","Because Dahl tells repeatedly of the cruelty of schoolmasters who constantly refined their caning techniques on him, some children will be saddened, and others enraged, by the unfairness of it all. These scenes clearly show the child's vulnerability in an adult world. But, unlike in most novels -- such as Dahl's own -- in this true story, the abusers never get their comeuppance. These are not reasons for children to avoid BOY, however; they may, in fact, be reasons children will respond to the book, which promotes the values of honest courage and determination. It also has lighter descriptions of teachers, such as the eccentric old bachelor, Corkers.","Parents need to know that this well-written book is most entertaining when author Roald Dahl sustains one adventure (like the mouse-and-sweetshop caper). But while Dahl's drawings are lively and add a lot to the action, the photographs and letters he provides are less successful. The text includes graphic depictions of teachers beating students with wooden canes, which could upset younger readers.

"The Last Magician, Book 1",Clever con schemes distinguish New York City fantasy.,"At the start of THE LAST MAGICIAN, time-traveling thief Esta is on a mission back to 1926 to steal a magical book -- a critical weapon in a war between the members of the Order and other practitioners of magic, known as the Mageus. The mission fails, causing drastic changes in the timeline. Esta must go back to 1902, find someone known as the Last Magician, and steal the book all over again. She falls in with a gang of dangerous criminals, but soon feels her loyalties tipping toward them. How can she save the future without destroying her new friends in the past?
","Con games and magic are a powerful combination in this complex tale of wizardry and crime. The setting of The Last Magician is both vivid and unusual -- New York City during the time of Tammany Hall. The cast includes escape artists, crooks, cons, and assassins, and author Lisa Maxwell gives each a welcome air of multidimensionality. Esta and Harte, in particular, flirt and feud, and their interplay proves to be one of the novel's highlights. Some readers may be confused by the intricate plot, but many will enjoy the constant surprises.","Parent's need to know that The Last Magician is a stand-alone fantasy by Lisa Maxwell (Unhooked) set in a magical Gilded Age New York City.

"No Choirboy: Murder, Violence, and Teenagers on Death Row",Raw stories from teens on death row; read along with teens.,"Author Susan Kuklin brings readers an intense, raw collection of interviews with teens on death row or in prison for life, letting them tell their stories in their own words. She includes one interview with the family of an executed prisoner. Readers hear about the crimes, the punishment, and prison life. Shocking life and death struggles are exposed as teens deal with a world of violence. Kuklin also explores the justice system and the inherent inequalities therein.
","This intense and, at times, heartbreaking, book is important because it  gives readers an honest look at juvenile crime and death row. It should be read by teens from every walk of life because it has lessons beyond the obvious ""stay out of trouble."" This is a book parents may want to read along with their kids and have meaningful discussions on issues ranging from justice and poverty, to the glorification of prison culture in the media. By allowing the interview subjects to tell their own story, Kuklin keeps the focus on the doubt and glimmers of hope that the teens, their families, or their lawyers have for the future. At the end of one interview, Roy, who was originally sentenced to die by electrocution when he was 16, talks of wanting to see the beach and later asks hopefully ""I mean, if I get out someday, do you think I can make it in society?"" While it's apparent that Kuklin is against the death penalty, there isn't any of policy-pushing or morality-thumping. ","Parents need to know that this is a book about teens on death row, told in their own words. While not overtly violent or offensive, it tackles difficult subjects and parents should be ready to discuss not only the crimes that landed these teens in jail, but also the dangers of living within the prison population, the impact of crimes on the families of the accused and families of the victims, and the consequences of an imperfect justice system. Though she isn't pushing for policy or harping on the morality of the justice system, the author is coming from an anti-death penalty point of view. Teens may feel sympathetic toward the criminals on death row (and be surprised that their backgrounds are not all desperate and impoverished).

No One Else Can Have You,"Darkly funny, very violent high school murder mystery.","In Friendship, Wisconsin, \""where no one else seemed to understand anything except how to gut a buck and go to church and be over-the-top nice without ever really bonding,\"" homecoming queen Ruth Fried and awkward Kippy Bushman have been BFFs from childhood, though Ruth's love life is starting to come between them. Then, on her way to a sleepover at Kippy's, Ruth is abducted, horribly murdered, and found the next morning in a cornfield. Ruth's mother gives her daughter's diary to Kippy so she can find some sweet eulogy material, and Kippy reads the snarky comments her popular friend makes about her. The service goes badly, and, soon after, the victim's football-hero boyfriend is jailed for her murder. Kippy doesn't like the guy, but she also doesn't think he did it; her quest to find the true killer lands her in many kinds of trouble and brings her friends in strange places.
","NO ONE ELSE CAN HAVE YOU is a bit of a kitchen-sink combo that's not for the faint of heart, but fans of gruesome absurdity (think Fargo) will love it. It mixes murder mystery, broad regional comedy, and sexed-up high school life with all the trappings of the horror genre (from gore, violence, and creepy mental hospitals to teens making ill-advised moves). Many teens will relate to Kippy's out-of-place feelings, her determination, and her creative-thinking skills as she tries to make sense of who her late friend was, whether they were really friends at all, and why she's so determined to find the killer anyway.","Parents need to know that No One Else Can Have You mixes humor, horror, sex, small-town strangeness, and teen angst in a violent but funny brew.

She also lies to her dad and other adults, burgles a house, and commits other questionable acts in her quest for the truth -- and also attracts the killer's interest. Teen and adult characters seem to be constantly having sex with one another; the murder victim was especially interested in the penis size of her various partners.

Sisterhood Everlasting,New book in popular Traveling Pants series targets adults.,"When a key character dies, the three remaining friends in the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants find a letter suggesting it was suicide. This sudden tragedy makes the friends fall apart inside themselves, and from each other: One leaves her boyfriend and becomes homeless, another makes plans to marry her jerky boyfriend, and another's love seems doomed, since she can't tell her partner how she feels. But the deceased friend has left additional notes for the friends she has known since birth, and these letters help them fix what's broken in their lives, figure out what exactly happened in hers -- and ultimately lead them back to each other.
","This follow-up may be targeted to an older audience, but readers will still be inspired by its powerful messages about the importance of love and friendship. There is a lot of grieving here, which can be somewhat overwhelming, but the author knows these characters well, and the readers who have long loved them will be willing to follow them anywhere, including down their own personal paths of destruction. The ending may wrap a little neatly -- OK, a lot neatly -- but it is a satisfying conclusion after all these girls have lived and learned, in this volume and throughout the series.","Parents need to know that this is a new installment of the popular Traveling Pants series, but this volume takes place nearly 10 years later and is written for an adult audience.

Tess and her dad are grieving deeply and have retreated into their own shells. Her dad smokes pot and doesn't do much parenting. Tess starts to withdraw from her friends because she thinks they'll never be able to understand the depth of her grief and the ways in which her life will never be the same. Tess' dad takes her on a spur-of-the-moment road trip, hoping it will bring them closer together, but initially it drives the wedge between them deeper. She needs him to be a dad, but he can't deal with life without his wife. The two end up in the Pacific Northwest town where her dad grew up. Tess gets to know the grandma who's been out of her life, due to her dad's estrangement from his mom. She also makes new friends, falls in love, and learns how to accept the love around her and how to deal with her grief. Woven into the story is the tale of a mysterious plant, the pixiebell, Tess inherited from her mom. Tess works hard to keep the plant and her mom's spirit alive. Her pixiebell project draws the interest of the locals, who rally around her and help her in her quest.
","In The Last Forever, author Deb Caletti spins a sweet, compelling tale with a wonderful message: that extraordinary things only become so because of the importance we place on them. The book realistically portrays the way teens deal with loss and the ways in which grief can get mixed up in the other emotional ups and downs of being a teenager. Once Tess and her dad arrive at the Puget Sound island where Tess's dad grew up, the story begins to take shape and to get more interesting. Tess meets many new, intriguing people, including the paternal grandmother she's never known. The small town is populated with eccentric adults and teens, but Tess' relationship with Henry, the boy she falls in love with, isn't well drawn and is too one-dimensional.

Tess is funny, sarcastic, and self-deprecating. She's never funnier than when she's playing out the film version of a scenario in her head and then has to face the less-than-ideal reality of the situation. She finds it hard to open up emotionally because she knows she'll completely fall apart when she does. This is a heartfelt, realistic depiction of someone going through a loss.

1919 The Year That Changed America,"Riveting tale of racial, labor protests, women's vote, more.","The first of six chapters in 1919 THE YEAR THAT CHANGED AMERICA, under the heading ""An Amazing Event,"" recount the Great Molasses Flood. A tank storing 2.3 million gallons of molasses exploded and sent deadly waves of the thick liquid into Boston's North End, destroying everything in its path. While the company blamed anarchists and Communists, a court would, for the first time, find a company liable for its negligence. The ""Women Got the Vote"" section looks at suffragists, the women who fought for 70 years for the passage of the 19th Amendment, and the people and groups who opposed it. ""The Red Summer"" chronicles not only waves of violence against African Americans, but also how, for the first time, African Americans mounted armed resistance against mobs of Whites. The fall of Russia to the Communists in 1917, sent a wave of fear across America and created ""The Red Scare."" Communists were thought to be behind labor strikes, suspected Communists were rounded up and deported, and the Department of Justice created a Communist-hunting division headed by a young J. Edgar Hoover. Soldiers returning from World War I expected to find better wages and working conditions. When they didn't, 1919 saw ""Strikes and More Strikes,"" with 36,000 work stoppages (including a strike by the Boston Police Department) that were met with violent responses from companies who blamed the troubles on Communists and  ""foreigners."" The final chapter, ""A Noble Experiment,"" looks at the history behind the movement to ban the production and sale of alcohol and the crime wave (think Al Capone) created by Prohibition.
","Even reluctant readers should be captivated by the wealth of personal stories and archival photos that bring this pivotal year in U.S. history vividly alive. While 1919 The Year That Changed America looks at the nation's past, it also presents provocative questions about the present and how some of the most complex and divisive social issues in American life are still to be resolved.","Parents need to know that Martin W. Sandler's 1919 The Year That Changed America won the 2019 National Book Award for Young People's Literature. The year 1919 was unlike almost any other in American history. Women had finally won the right to vote, Prohibition was about to take effect, and a fear of Communists and anarchists swept the nation. Throughout the year, there would be often unimaginable acts of violence against African Americans and workers protesting low wages and terrible working conditions. The six chapters cover social issues and events many students may already have studied in class (women's suffrage) and others that may be surprising to both readers and their parents (a deadly molasses flood that destroyed parts of Boston's North End). Violence is a thread that runs throughout the book, with lynchings, fire bombings, and rampaging mobs becoming  new normal across America. This is history that's surprising, vividly told and thought-provoking.

"Forest of Wonders: Wing & Claw, Book 1","Talking beasts, bright kids pep up fantasy series start.","Raffa and his cousin Garith, apothecaries in training, are so excited when Garith's father tells them they're invited to move from their rural settlement into the city of Gilden to work directly for the Chancellor. Raffa is ready to pack his bags until his mother and father change their minds suddenly and mysteriously. Raffa is heartbroken when Garith and his uncle leave without him and consoles himself by taking care of a gravely injured bat. He expertly uses a special vine he finds in the FOREST OF WONDERS to help cure him. It seems to be working but with the strangest side effect: The bat is asking for his favorite insect snacks by name. Raffa and his father start experimenting with the vine to see what else it can do, but the first trial proves disastrous; Raffa's hand cracks and throbs in pain until his father finds an antidote. Raffa is worried about what else the plant can do and that his cousin Garith took some with him to Gilden. What's worse, his parents don't seem worried enough. So Raffa sneaks out at night with his talking bat to head to the big city and warn him. In Gilden by himself, Raffa begins to realize just why his parents turned down such a prestigious job. His uncle and the Chancellor have some big secrets to hide.
","Young animal-loving fantasy fans will find much to enjoy in the Wing & Claw series start, including talking animals, a brilliant young apothecary and his resourceful friends, and a mysterious forest. The beginning of the book is a little misleading, with the setup of the Forest of Wonders. Readers will be expecting to get lost in that magical place with the main character, Raffa. But instead of heading back to the forest, Raffa goes to the big city -- a place with even bigger secrets but not wondrous ones. It's rather hard to fathom why the bad guys are acting the way they are; there aren't a lot of hints for the reader to go on.
However, Raffa's escapes from soldiers using his stash of apothecary ingredients are as clever as the new friends he meets. Both Kuma and Trixin are strong girl characters whom readers will immediately root for. And after an exciting cliffhanger, kids will clamor to see what's next for Raffa and all his friends, human and furry, in Book 2.","Parents need to know that Forest of Wonders is the first book in the new Wing & Claw fantasy series by Newbery Medal winner Linda Sue Park (A Single Shard). It's a great fit for animal-loving kids who are just digging into fantasy, but expect to run across some hurt and mistreated animals. Raffa, a gifted young apothecary, tries his best to cure a bat and some raccoons injured by large birds. Large birds also attack people and try to peck out eyes and deafen them with piercing cries. Other than that, violence is mild -- apothecary ingredients are cleverly used instead of weapons to fight soldiers in pursuit. Raffa is the kind of main character who makes some mistakes and lets curiosity get the better of him at times but shows profound respect for the healing profession and all the creatures in his care.

"Close Encounters of the Nerd Kind: The Nerdy Dozen, Book 2",Likable kids anchor goofy secret-agent sequel.,"Ever completing a secret mission for the U.S. Air Force, eighth-grader Neil Andertol has found his regular civilian life a little boring. He's thrilled to be reunited with his friends and gamers from the last mission for another high-stakes adventure. This time, the Nerdy Dozen are needed to recover a stolen spacecraft. It soon becomes clear there's an even bigger concern:  deadly asteroid hurtling toward Earth. Neil is charged with commanding his team, relying primarily on his experience playing a video game intended to prepare him for a mission like this ... only Neil never actually played the game. He hopes his instincts will be enough to save the Earth and get his friends home safely.
","The first book had plenty of goofy plot points, but the sequel levels up the implausibility to near absurdity. CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE NERD KIND reunites the young heroes of the first book in the Nerdy Dozen series, this time sending them into space. We encounter an invisible secret station on the moon, kids tracking down their lost parents across the solar system, and even an ailment called ""Advanced Space Silliness."" Serviceable but uninspired writing just barely pulls the plot together. Affable characters, layers of looniness, and a fantastical plot make this a fun, quick read.","Parents need to know that Close Encounters of the Nerd Kind, the second in Jeff Miller's Nerdy Dozen series, features a team of avid online gamers who come together in real life to tackle top-secret missions. They're a quirky bunch, but they're fiercely loyal to one another. The team is put into perilous situations, but they're so unrealistically over-the-top -- fleeing an erupting volcano on Mars, escaping from a bored teen's basement on the moon -- that they're never frightening. Neil's family is completely unaware of his work for the government, which doesn't seem too concerned about sending children into dangerous circumstances.

"Get Mooned: Joey & Johnny, the Ninjas, Book 1",Giddily fun start to ninja series has lots of fighting.,"Best friends Joey and Johnny are students at Kick Foot Academy, a very traditional -- and dangerous! -- ninja school in Lemming Falls. Though they're devoted to becoming spectacular ninjas, they seem to cause chaos wherever they go. Nevertheless, their intimidating headmaster taps them to keep tabs on a suspicious exchange student, who turns out to be a superhero sidekick-in-training. On their mission, the boys discover that their rivals in Red Moon Clan have been arming themselves with mechanical suits and high-tech weaponry -- which is so not ninja. The two ninja schools must face each other in the traditional Test of Three to determine which school will survive -- and which will shut down for good.
","Joey and Johnny hurtle from one amped-up adventure to the next in a lively world filled with ninjas, superheroes, con men, and shadowy villains. The silliness is sometimes crammed to overflowing.
The plot of GET MOONED unspools loosely, with meandering asides on pop culture or the astral plane. There's hardly a line of dialogue or a descriptive sentence that doesn't aim for a chuckle. But most of those chuckles are well-earned with engaging wordplay and clever writing. Comics panels and spot illustrations add to the fun and help draw readers, even reluctant ones, in.","Parents need to know that Get Mooned: Joey & Johnny, the Ninjas, Book 1​ kicks off a funny, frenetically paced series. Spot illustrations and intermittent comic-strip sequences add to the appeal, especially for graphic novel fans. The violence -- and there's a lot of it -- is over-the-top ridiculous: daily battles with a venomous mountain-dwelling octopus, school lunch turned into a contact sport, a class focused on wielding and avoiding all things sharp and pointy. The octopus’ venom causes victims to behave similarly to someone under the influence of alcohol or drugs; they speak nonsense, appear to hallucinate, and ultimately pass out.

When Birdie's workaholic mom goes overseas for business, her father allows her to visit the grandmother she's never met. What starts as a simple trip turns into the adventure of a lifetime, giving Birdie the opportunity and awesome responsibility of reconnecting her family and saving a dying world at the same time. Will she be able to do it?
","Author Jan Bozarth has written an adventure story with a lot going for it. The characters are strong, lovable, and come with all the vunerabilities real girls have. Instead of creating a fluffy novel that concentrates on pretty fairies and magical river maidens, Bozarth imagined a fantasy world twith depth and complexity, much like the real world where our heroes Birdie and Kerka live. There is danger, wonderful twists and turns, disappointments, triumphs, and heroic fights.
Audiences will love seeing young girls in a true adventure story where they aren't relagated to damsels in distress or side kicks. There are great lessons in friendship, loyalty, and the special bonds families share, and even some botany lessons sneaked in for good measure. It appears with the Fairy Godmothers series that Bozarth seeks to show that every girl has a special talent that makes her who she is and allows her to shine. In this novel, Birdie's green thumb is the focus, and surely readers will clamor to get the next book to find out where the other fairy godmothers' talents lie.","Parents need to know that there are some scary incidents, including a girl falling from high in the air, girls being attacked by plants, and girls being chased by a large sea creature.

Pet,"Girl hunts for a monster in strange, beautiful fantasy.","When PET begins, Jam,  transgender teen girl, lives in the town of Lucille, where ""monsters,"" people who abuse others, have been rooted out in a revolution led by ""angels,"" revered members of the community. Jam learns about these angels and monsters in school. She's curious about supernatural angels. She's lso aware that her mother, Bitter, was the product of a monster's abuse of her grandmother. Jam accidentally brings to life a creature from one of her mother's paintings. It tells her to call it Pet and that it has come to hunt a monster in the house of her dear friend Redemption. Jam's parents tell her there are no more monsters. They instruct her to send the creature back to the other world from which it came. Unwilling to risk the possibility that her friend might be hurt, Jam secretly allows Pet to remain in the world and commits herself to hunting the monster.
","This exquisite and strange book could be a great comfort for the kind of young reader who feels alone in facing the world's darkness. Akwaeke Emezi (Freshwater, adult fiction long-listed for the Carnegie Medal and National Book Award) decided that Pet, her debut YA novel, would depict  teen who's not yet sexual and a transgender character whose life is not tragic. Jam is accepted, supported, and loved, and gets to have an adventure. She's a regular kid, relatable to any kid who feels different. The trouble in Jam's world comes not from her identity but from the fact that the dults of her town are steeped in denial about what's going on in the world. They've forgotten that ordinary humans can be monsters. Jam partners with a supernatural creature that helps her hunt the monster in their midst and that counsels her not to be afraid.","Parents need to know that Pet, by Akwaeke Emezi, is a science fiction-fantasy novel about a transgender teen girl who hunts a child abuser in her town with the help of a creature that comes to life from her mother's painting. Jam lives in the town of Lucille, where, according to all the adults, ""monsters"" (people who commit abuse against others) have been eliminated by ""angels"" (valiant members of the community who led a revolution). There's infrequent strong language, including ""s--t"" and variations of ""f--k."" Three specific instances of violence occur: A child is physically, and possibly sexually, abused. A woman is said to be the product of rape. The revenge against the abuser is graphic.

"Clockwork Princess: Infernal Devices, Book 3",Enthralling trilogy conclusion tugs at the heartstrings.,"CLOCKWORK PRINCESS is the final installment in the Infernal Devices trilogy. Tessa Gray, now 17 years old, is living in London with her adopted family of Shadowhunters. Not only is she continuing her path of self-discovery, but she is also engaged to the selfless and compassionate Jem. Regrettably, Jem is living with a fatal disease and his days are numbered. The couple decides to rush their wedding date so they can enjoy whatever time they have left together in wedlock. Plans go terribly awry when a carriage full of automatons pulls into the institute and kidnaps Tessa. The evil Magister will stop at nothing to use Tessa's shape-shifting powers for his own benefit. His objective: to eliminate all of the Shadowhunters in the world. Questions are finally answered in this concluding installment, along with the truth about why it's better to be mere mortal than to experience life everlasting.
","CLOCKWORK PRINCESS is a fantastic book that will pull at your heartstrings from beginning to end. The love triangle between Tessa, Jem, and Will becomes so painful at times that readers may want to send the book flying across the room. This just shows that Cassandra Clare is an enthralling storyteller whose readers will become emotionally invested in her plot and characters.
Clockwork Princess is wildly imaginative as it examines themes of marriage, family, dictatorship, and democracy. Characters grow to learn that true love is blind, sometimes your strongest family is the one you choose for yourself, and what happens to a society when citizens do not question their leader.","Parents need to know that Clockwork Princess is more violent than the previous two installments in the Infernal Devices fantasy trilogy.  The Shadowhunters slay a giant worm, and an army of automatons destroys an entire village and all the people in it. People are stabbed, dismembered, and engage in fistfights. But, the most painful piece of this jigsaw puzzle is the three main characters' love triangle. There's passionate kissing, undressing, and a teen couple has sex.

When I Was the Greatest,Swaggering but sentimental story about loyalty.,"Fifteen-year-old Allen Brooks, nicknamed Ali for his boxing skill, befriends two new kids on his block in Brooklyn's tough Bed-Stuy neighborhood. The younger of the two has Tourette's syndrome, which embarrasses his older brother to the point of lashing out. After Ali comes to his new friend's rescue at a party, out-boxing two thugs, they put out the word that they will take revenge. Will Ali's estranged dad step in to save his son? The conclusion gives Ali ""one of the best days of my life.""
","Although some young readers will be comfortable with the cartoonish characters, others may be disappointed when the story's climax takes place offstage and any chance for a big ending goes poof. This debut novel also rides high on the shoulders of cliche: the mom who works two jobs and reigns with tough love, the whip-smart little sis who gives everyone a cute nickname (the neighbor boys are Needles and Noodles). Details about life in tough central Brooklyn are well played, though.","Parents need to know that When I Was the Greatest shows in fine detail how Allen, a teen boy in a tough Brooklyn neighborhood, needs his father's help when some local thugs set out for revenge. Despite its slang and swagger -- ""s--t"" appears in the third paragraph -- the book minimizes sex, drugs, and violence and maximizes affection and dependability. When I Was the Greatest might appeal to a teen who knows, or wants to know, the pressures that shape the lives of the working poor. But, for all its social realism, the storytelling by this first-time author is clumsy. When the climax of this melodrama takes place offstage, the emotional charge fizzles.

American Royals,Imagined U.S. royal family tale best for romance fans.,"AMERICAN ROYALS tells what it might be like if George Washington had said yes to the crown. Now, 200+ years and umpteen generations later, the United States of America continues to be ruled by the House of Washington. Oldest daughter Beatrice, 21, will someday inherit the throne from her father, King George IV. Groomed for the role of queen from a young age, Beatrice has mastered controlling her emotions and perfect behavior in public. But as her parents start to pressure her to marry (a member of the American nobility, of course), Beatrice finds herself falling for a commoner. Meanwhile, younger sister Samantha grows tired of always playing second fiddle, all the more so when the guy she really likes is a top candidate for Beatrice's prince consort. Samantha's twin brother Jefferson recently broke up with Daphne, his girlfriend of several years. Daphne's a picture-perfect candidate for princess, but her ambition knows no bounds, and she's not about to give up on Jeff yet.
","Glittering parties, fabulous clothes, unimaginable wealth, and swoon-worthy love interests are all here to captivate fans of romance and royalty. Author Katharine McGee has built  believable world with the intriguing premise that, since its creation by revolution, the U.S. has been ruled by George Washington and his descendants in an unbroken line of American Royals. And as in her popular Thousandth Floor series, McGee makes it easy to keep track of who's who and keeps the pages turning by switching among several points of view.
Unlike her earlier series, though, there's much, much less intrigue and mystery beyond the usual romantic will-they-or-won't-they suspense. That makes this new series better suited for romance fans only. Most of the content is pretty mild, but readers need to be mature enough to take the glamorization of wealth and celebrity in stride. The cliffhanger ending of this installment is by no means the end of the story, and fans will be glad that a second installment is promised for the fall of 2020.","Parents need to know that American Royals is a romance that imagines what an American royal family would be like. Similar to author Katharine McGee's popular Thousandth Floor series, it's about a group of older teens in the highest, most glamorous levels of society. For a romance, the sexy stuff is pretty mild: mostly a lot of swooning kisses, with a couple of instances of implied sex. No body parts are described. Alcohol consumption at parties is glamorized, although excess is rare. A few teens who are months short of legal age drink at parties. One character plans to sedate another in order to take compromising pictures for blackmail, with severe consequences. There's minor violence (a character remembers a teacher smacking her on the hands with a ruler in the past; splattered blood from an illness is described), and strong language (""sluts,"" ""bitch"") is rare. There are mostly positive messages about responsible leadership, trying to make things better, and not letting obligation or tradition stand in the way of personal happiness but instead working to change things for the better.

The Iliad,"Gods and men manipulate war in exciting, gory epic.","When Homer's ILIAD begins, the Trojans and Achaians are already at war. Throughout the poem, the advantage shifts from one side to the other as gods and goddesses interfere, men and/or gods call temporary truces, and mortals jockey for power. A key issue that carries through the poem involves a conflict between Agamemnon, the brother of Achaian king Menelaos, and the great warrior Achilles. Agamemnon steals a woman who had been awarded to Achilles as a prize for battles won, but Achilles loves the woman and wants her to be returned. Achilles refuses to fight until the woman is restored to him, and the gods choose sides. At the core of the war is the fact that Paris, a Trojan prince, has stolen Helen, the wife of Menelaos. Menelaos doesn't want to return home until his army has sacked Troy and he has retrieved Helen. Other key players in the drama are the great strategist/soldier Odysseus and Troy's brave warrior Hektor, who use their superior intelligence and skills to fight their enemies, and seem to be above the petty fray.
","The book definitely has many fine qualities: poetic language, brave warriors, interfering immortals, strong and caring friendships, and exciting battle scenes. The Iliad is not studied by middle or high school students as commonly as Homer's Odyssey, perhaps because the war portrayed in The Iliad includes so many individual battles and characters that its 500-plus pages become a lot to digest.The book also weaves in and out of the ""present"" of the book, as character often reflect on past events; The Odyssey is somewhat more linear, and the narrative is easier for students to follow. However, several of the intertwining plots in The Iliad are essential to read and understand for any student of the classics.","Parents need to know that the ancient Greek epic poem The Iliad, by Homer, depicts the women, warriors, gods and goddesses involved in the fictional Trojan War between the Trojans and Achaians. Whereas personal conflicts between the characters propel the plot, most of the action takes place on the battlefield, where many men are killed or injured. This essential volume of classical literature includes a lot of graphic violence -- mostly inflicted by fighting with spears -- and some sex in which women are usually objectified, as they are considered prizes to be won in battle. As in Homer's Odyssey, there are also graphic descriptions of animals being slaughtered and sacrificed, and a good deal of wine is consumed.

Nadia's troubles make Amelia start to think about her own father. Who is he? Will she ever meet him? Should she write him a letter? This cliffhanger installment of Amelia's ongoing journal will delight and surprise readers with real, pull-out letters and a sequel.
 ","This book deals with several topics attractive to 8- to 12-year-olds. There's Halloween, comic-strip illustrating, and letter writing, plus a few less familiar situations, such as having to care for an injured parent or trying to solve the mystery of an absent parent.
The real fun for any kid will be in piecing together this interesting story via entertaining letters and postcards. A group of girls ages 6 to 11 who read this book together unanimously named the four pull-out letters inserted into actual envelopes as this book's highlight. As always, the watercolor doodles and illustrations were also a big hit, and they support the text well. But the sample group of readers was a little annoyed at the ending; in this book, Amelia never does meet her father, nor does she even actually write a letter to him. You've got to get the sequel for that.","Parents need to know that though unresolved, the plot is suspenseful and unfolds through lively correspondence between two friends -- a format that kids will find unique and appealing.

Hiawatha and the Peacemaker,Gorgeous picture book brings timely peace message.,"In the 14th century, Mohawk warrior Hiawatha returns home to find everything burned to the ground and his wife and daughters slain. Knowing this can only be the work of the evil Chief Tadodaho, Hiawatha is planning revenge when a stranger appears. It's the Peacemaker, who brings a new message: The five Iroquois tribes must stop warring with one another and behave as one family. His word is strong, but his voice is weak because of a speech impediment, so he asks Hiawatha, a fine speaker, to help him reach the tribes. Soon HIAWATHA AND THE PEACEMAKER set sail in a white canoe of hand-carved stone, hoping to persuade the nations to lay down their weapons; they face many challenges along the way.
","A long-overlooked, still-timely story, which Robbie Robertson first heard as a child from an Iroquois elder, comes to life in stately language and rich, brilliantly colored illustrations. Robertson complements the book's strong, poetic narrative with an audio track, ""The Peacemaker,"" in which he tells another version of the legend. Kids too young to read the book themselves or to understand all the vocabulary will be drawn in by the sound and rhythm of the words, as well as by David Shannon's magnificent illustrations.
Sensitive or nightmare-prone kids may have trouble with some situations, especially the killing of Hiawatha's family, or images, especially of monstrous villains and characters in face paint.","Parents need to know that Hiawatha and the Peacemaker has nothing to do with the hero of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem but instead is about two legendary 14th-century men who united the warring Mohawk, Cayuga, Onodaga, Seneca, and Oneida tribes into the People of the Long House -- one family who could live together in peace. Noted musician/songwriter Robbie Robertson, himself descended from Mohawk and Cayuga ancestors, first heard the tale as a child from a tribal elder. He retells it in strong, stately language, while Caldecott Honor winner David Shannon's rich, colorful illustrations bring the characters compellingly to life. Some images (such as the monstrously evil villain) and situations (the killing of Hiawatha's family) may be too intense for some kids.

When he learns that his parents, as prisoners of war, are being taken to New York, Samuel sets out into enemy territory.
","WOODS RUNNER is a worthy page-turner, just right for the reader who is ready for a gripping, informational book with some violence.

Frank and Lucky Get Schooled,Playful intro to academic subjects via curious boy and pup.,"In FRANK AND LUCKY GET SCHOOLED, Frank was having an unlucky day when he went to the animal shelter and ""got Lucky."" Boy and dog bond quickly and explore the world around them: ""Both of them were just pups. They had a lot to learn."" Lucky investigates in a dog-like way (""Can I catch it? Can I eat it?"") as Frank poses more scholarly questions -- for instance, one involving percentage and fractions (""How much of the bed is Lucky's, and how much is Frank's?""). Perkins relates the questions directly to academic fields of study, pointing out the relationships to math, botany, entomology, chemistry, astronomy, taxonomy, geometry, geography, history, art, and foreign language, but ""the whole wide world with Lucky was the subject Frank liked best.""
","This playful and ambitious picture book is a warm friendship story of a boy and his frisky rescue pup as well as a celebration of learning and a friendly introduction to serious academic subjects. As Frank and Lucky roam the meadow and woods that border their house, they search the night sky for stars (astronomy), pick burrs from Lucky's fur (botany), make friends with quacking ducks and a Spanish-speaking neighbor (foreign language), and share the limited space of a bed (math, fractions). The two wander and wonder, asking questions about the world around them, and as Frank and Lucky Get Schooled, so does the reader.
Written and illustrated by Newbery winner Lynn Rae Perkins, the book's exquisitely crafted. The lively, free-roaming structure mirrors Frank and Lucky's own wide-ranging adventures, and there's plenty of sly humor and clever text in this masterful tribute to the world and its wonders.","Parents need to know that Frank and Lucky Get Schooled by Newbery winner Lynne Rae Perkins (Criss Cross) is a warm, witty boy-dog friendship story that's also chock-full of information. When Frank adopts Lucky, the two explore the world around them, and their insatiable curiosity is contagious. Read: ""The time Lucky wondered about skunks, they learned about Chemistry"" as Frank experiments with different substances to wash out the smell. The story introduces a range of academic subjects -- entomology, geometry, history -- as well as concepts -- percentages, infinity, perspective -- showing that opportunities for learning abound in the world around us.

Tradition,"Powerful look at feminism, rape culture at an elite school.","Award-winning author Brendan Kiely's (The Last True Love Story, All American Boys) contemporary young adult novel is set at Fullbrook Academy, an elite New England boarding school that's been educating the country's privileged and powerful for generations. The book takes the alternating points of view of two seniors: outspoken feminist Jules Devereux, a second-generation student whose mother was in the prep school's first graduating class to allow women, and hockey scholarship student Jamie Baxter, who's repeating his senior year and escaping a traumatic past in his Ohio hometown. Jules' ex-boyfriend is the Big Man On Campus, Ethan, but she's now ""off boys"" and committed to exposing the hypocritical sexism and persistent rape culture on Fullbrook's campus. Meanwhile, Jamie agrees with Jules -- with whom he shares a platonic bond -- but he's aware that scholarship kids (even white ones) are expected to toe the line, support the status quo, and act grateful for their chance to be educated at Fullbrook. When Jules is assaulted at a party, Jamie must decide whether to keep his head down or help his friend take a stand.
","It's never easy to read about sexism or sexual assault, particularly involving rich, entitled young men who believe they're above the law, but Kiely's story is a thought-provoking read. Before he was a full-time writer, Kiely taught in elite prep schools, so he understands the culture he's exploring and writes believably about the insider perspective (legacies, athletes, and kids whose parents pay full freight), as well as the outsider points of view (outcasts, misfits, and scholarship kids). Jules isn't typically likable, but she's incredibly fierce and opinionated -- as is Aileen, an artist the boys nickname ""the Viking"" as a wink wink to all of her conquests. Jamie is earnest and conflicted about whether to rock the boat as a scholarship athlete who's supposed to keep his head on the ice and in the game -- and possibly on hooking up with girls, but NOT on being the ""campus femiNazis"" ally and friend.
Kiely has emerged as a true talent in contemporary, issues-based young adult fiction, and Tradition doesn't disappoint. There's no predictable love story as you might expect in a co-ed, dual point of view narrative, and that's actually quite refreshing. Jamie and Jules' connection is based in friendship, not the possibility of romance. There is romance in the overall story, but it's secondary to the main plot. This is a book that will make readers think and wonder what they'd do at Fullbrook -- stand with Jules, Jamie, and company, or go along with the flow with the popular and conforming teens?","Parents need to know that Tradition is a contemporary novel about two seniors (one female, one male) at a prestigious New England boarding school where toxic masculinity and sexism/sexual assault go hand in hand. Written by award-winning author Brendan Kiely, the book uses a dual narrative structure to explore not only rape culture but also class and privilege (and how these are often used as shields against consequences) -- and the myriad ways girls and women are disenfranchised by the entitlement of men and boys. Although the book was written by a man, it's sensitive to the way young women struggle with the stigma of sexism and sexual assault in school settings. It's a powerful choice for a parent-teen read and will spark several important conversations.

"After The End, Book 1",Gritty sci-fi survival tale questions reality and authority.,"Juneau Newhaven lives in the Alaskan wilderness with her clan and father. She's been taught to believe that World War III in 1984 destroyed the earth, leaving her people as the only survivors for decades. And she's been trained to believe she has a mystical, paranormal power that connects her to the earth, and has a religious belief in being one with nature, called the Yara. When she discovers her father and clan are missing, Juneau goes in search of them. Once outside her territory, she enters thriving, present-day Anchorage and discovers that everything she's been led to believe is a lie. There was no World War III or apocalypse. Juneau feels betrayed and hurt by her people. Along her journey, she meets Miles, a rich kid who helps her, but also questions her sanity -- and eventually falls for her. The farther she gets from home, the less she feels connected to nature and her powers. Eventually, Juneau and Miles are forced to make a choice between friendship and family. Juneau's race to find her clan turns into a game of survival against the men her hunting down -- including Miles' father, who wants Juneau for his own purposes.
","Told in alternating first-person, present-tense narration by Juneau and Miles, the novel's moves slowly at first, but once Juneau discovers her clan is missing, the pace picks up. Readers will especially enjoy the interaction and banter between Juneau and Miles, who need each other for specific reasons and come to rely on each other. Juneau's completely serious about her mission of finding her family, and Miles provides plenty of comic relief. He doesn't accept that Juneau was fed weird lies and has magical powers, even until the end, which helps makes the story believable. There are lots of interesting characters and side characters, but Juneau and Miles are truly the heart of the novel. The cliffhanger will leave readers desperate to find out what happens next. After The End is a good mixture of science fiction, mystery, thriller, and romance, with lots of political and social issues to engage readers and possibly inspire them to question their own world. And for readers looking for diverse characters in novels, note that Juneau is part-Chinese, part white.  ","Parents need to know that After The End is about a teen girl who's been led to believe there was a World War III in 1984, from which she and her clan were the only survivors, living in the Alaskan wilderness until the present day -- but finds out it was all a lie. There's some violence -- killing of animals to survive, hand-to-hand-combat and with weapons (knife, crossbow, gun) -- and swearing (including ""ass,"" ""s--t,"" ""f--k,"" ""bulls--t,"" ""prick""). After The End also has romance and two kissing scenes. Politics, global warming, brainwashing, and religion are among the thought-provoking topics discussed.

The Night Gardener,Mysterious gardener brightens gray town in magical story.,"In THE NIGHT GARDENER, William looks out the window of his orphanage at the grim, gray world and sees that, overnight, someone has clipped a tree to create a topiary sculpture of an owl. The next day, another topiary animal appears, and then more appear. The gray town brightens, the people celebrate, and when William spies the mysterious gardener, he follows him into the park and helps him clip more trees into fanciful shapes. The next morning, the gardener has vanished, but he's left a pair of shears for William as a present. Fall and winter come, stripping the trees of their leaves, and the gardener disappears form the town. But a bright, colorful spread of the town in spring makes it clear that ""the people of the small town were never the same. And neither was William"" -- who's pictured continuing the gardener's important work.
","In a lovely, generous-spirited book about the transformative power of art, a depressed town is changed forever after it's visited by a mysterious gardener who clips the trees into topiary animals. This debut picture book by two Canadian brothers who worked together on both art and story is spectacularly illustrated. Set on Grimloch Lane in an unspecified time with monotone period detail that evokes Dorothea Lange's black-and-white photographs from the Great Depression, we see cracks in the sidewalks, old tires littering overgrown yards, splintering fences, and people who are hunched and cheerless. But once the gardener clips the trees into topiary animals, color arrives and, with it, wonder, industry, and whimsy. The people paint their houses, fix their roofs, fly kites, have picnics, and are even inspired to hang Chinese lanterns by the topiary of the dragon. It's a gentle, magical tale of hope and cheer.","Parents need to know that The Night Gardener, a collaboration by the talented Fan brothers, is a lovely book about what can happen when a drab, depressed town is visited by a generous, spirited gardener who clips the trees into whimsical topiaries, bringing art and wonder. The book serves up gorgeous, evocative art, and an implicit socially conscious message about how to revive neglected communities or even just our depressed inner selves. When the gardener creates wonder, the people take time to notice and appreciate the new beauty around them. The detail in the art invites many close readings, making the book a smart and happy choice for a home library.

Eddie Red Undercover: Mystery on Museum Mile,Boy sketch artist helps catch art thieves in zippy mystery.,"EDDIE RED UNDERCOVER: MYSTERY ON MUSEUM MILE is told through the eyes of 11-year-old Edmund Lonnrot, a short African-American sixth grader with two special skills -- he has a photographic memory and he's an exceptional artist. When the New York City police discover his talent, they enlist him as an afterschool and weekend undercover observer and sketch artist to help solve a baffling series of thefts in Manhattan museums. In return, ""Eddie Red, as the lead detective dubs him, hopes to earn enough money to attend a prestigious private school his family could not otherwise afford. He works and clashes with a hard-boiled detective who doesn't really want Eddie on the case. Meanwhile, Eddie gets help from his brainy and obsessive friend Jonah as they try to crack the mystery together.
","Eddie Red Undercover: Mystery on Museum Mile is the first novel by Marcia Wells, and it's a zippy and engaging read, with plenty of humor and vivid characters. It also features wonderful sketches of different people in the story (supposedly by Eddie, but actually done by illustrator Marcos Calo) that really capture their personalities. The world of fine art and New York museums is perhaps a slightly odd choice as a setting for middle-grade novel, but Wells manages to make it seem quite interesting and exciting. Young readers will definitely learn a few things about art -- and the intricacies of police work -- along the way. One complaint: The solution to one of the primary mysteries of the book is almost incomprehensible, even if you are chess fanatic. That's the only downer in an otherwise fine book.
 ","Parents need to know that Eddie Red Undercover: Mystery on Museum Mile is a taut, often funny mystery about an African-American sixth grader who becomes embroiled in a complex case involving art thieves. The police enlist his help after they discover he has a photographic memory and can draw perfect sketches of possible suspects. There's some violence, including one graphic shooting and Eddie being duct-taped to a drainpipe by a criminal, but it's a small part of the story. Eddie's also the victim of some mild taunting/bullying at school. The book does not talk down to its target audience; in fact, it includes a fair amount of complicated vocabulary, unexplained mentions of ADHD and OCD and the slang ""meds,"" as well as discussions of artists and New York museums. Eddie's race does not factor into the story in any significant way, but it's notable because of the relative rarity of having the main character in this type of book be a person of color. The novel features a number of Eddie's sketches of characters (including himself and his father) and suspects -- engaging black-and-white full-page portraits by illustrator Marcos Calo -- as well as a couple of Manhattan street maps. This is the first book in the Eddie Red series.

"By the Time You Read This, I'll Be Dead",Realistic portrayal of a teen committed to killing herself.,"When depressed Daelyn stumbles upon a mysterious website called \""Through-the-Light,\"" she is given 23 days to decide if she really wants to kill herself. The site asks her questions that help her reflect on her decision (For example, \""Who will help you through the darkness?\""). The site also provides her a community where she can vent t her problems (and read what other suicidal users have to say). But as she is preparing herself to leave this world, she makes a surprising connection with an offbeat boy with a secret of his own. Suddenly, she has to rethink everything.
","Daelyn is a realistic character whom readers will empathize with. The author makes her tragic story come to life, even when using devices that could easily fall flat (like chat board discussions). Her relationship with Santana seems a little too well timed. But, ultimately, this book will certainly give readers a lot to contemplate, especially its open-ended conclusion.
This author is known for teen books that push the envelope on edgy subject matter. Of course, sadly, it could certainly resonate with some teens for the wrong reasons.","Parents need to know that this is an intense book that centers on a teen who is about to kill herself. This book includes frank discussions of different methods, including their pain and effectiveness ratings. There is plenty of other intense material as well:  In elementary school, Daelyn is sexually attacked by boys in a boys' bathroom. She is also verbally and physically humiliated at an abusive ""fat camp."" A previous suicide attempt left her having to wear a neck brace and unable to talk. She spends a lot of time on a website that helps users make plans for their own suicides. Other participants on the website talk about being raped and molested. The language, like the topics, can be rough. While there's plenty to frighten parents away from this book, as a small positive note it could be an entry point to talk to teens about cyberbullying.

The War That Saved My Life,"Abused girl finds courage, family in compelling WWII story.","In London just before World War II, Ada doesn't know how old she is, her last name, or much of anything of life outside the room where her mother has kept her in terrible conditions for as long as she can remember. Ada's mother is humiliated at the thought of people knowing she has a disabled daughter (Ada was born with a clubfoot nd gets around by crawling), so Ada has no dealings with other people, except to wave from her window. Her younger brother, Jamie, who's about to start school, is more mobile nd sometimes steals food for his starving sister. Their mother beats them both regularly and often doesn't give them enough to eat. Suddenly, as World War II and a possible German invasion loom, the kids are evacuated to the countryside, where they're so filthy and lice-infested that nobody wants them. When a reclusive local spinster is forced to take them in, their lives change in unimaginable ways, including having clean clothes and regular meals. Also, there's a pony. As the kids experience love and kindness for the first time in their lives nd learn to pitch in with the war effort, Ada can't get away from her biggest terror: that their new happiness will last only until their mother finds it more convenient to take them back to their old life.
","In lesser hands than those of Kimberly Brubaker Bradley, the plot might tumble into cliché, but thanks to Ada's unforgettable character and unflinching voice, you're too busy cheering her on. She comes into her own as she experiences a world she's never imagined. A cynic, even a young one, might note in passing that THE WAR THAT SAVED MY LIFE includes elements we've seen many times before: Lives change when a reclusive curmudgeon takes in waifs; a pony transforms a troubled girl's life; brave Brits rise to the occasion in wartime. But they're artfully woven into the story. You'll also share the anxiety that gives Ada bigger panic attacks the better her life gets, because it's all going to be snatched away. She explains to her new friend that she doesn't want her guardian, Susan, to help her, because ""I don't want to get used to her. She's just someone we have to stay with for a little while. She's not, you know, actually real.""","Parents need to know that The War That Saved My Life, which was named a 2016 Newbery Honor book, is a standout coming-of-age story set in the English countryside during World War II. Wartime brings new, scary things into the characters' lives, from bomb shelters and destroyed homes to the plane crashes that kill the pilots at the nearby air base. Far more troubling, especially to sensitive readers, is the character of Ada and Jamie's abusive mother, who regularly smacks the kids around and has kept Ada, born with a clubfoot, locked up in one room her whole life -- and who hangs ominously in the background when the kids land in the country, where they experience care and kindness for the first time in their lives. Kids and adults will cheer for Ada as she discovers she has value and learns to stand up for herself -- but will her mother take the kids back and destroy it all? There's lots of historical detail about World War II in England, from the evacuation of kids to the countryside to details about British military planes.

Turtles All the Way Down,"Thought-provoking exploration of mental illness, first love.","In TURTLES ALL THE WAY DOWN, John Green tells the story of Indianapolis 16-year-old Aza Holmes, who struggles with debilitating obsessive-compulsive disorder, repetitive intrusive thoughts, and extreme anxiety. Aza has a loyal best friend, Daisy Ramirez, an enthusiastic extrovert who can talk about anything with anyone. Aza's unwanted thoughts make her feel disconnected from her self and the here and now; her main preoccupation is that she'll contract a bacterial infection like C. diff. When a local Indianapolis billionaire goes missing and police offer a $100,000 reward for information about his whereabouts, Daisy recalls that Aza had attended grief camp with the billionaire's son, Davis. (Aza's father and Davis' mother each died when the kids were in elementary school). Daisy, who comes from a low-income family, persuades Aza to play detective with her and get reacquainted with Davis -- $100,000 would help them both go to college. Once Aza meets Davis again, however, they rekindle a bond that equally thrills and terrifies Aza.
","John Green delves deeper into the dark reaches of the teenage brain than ever before, creating a remarkable if occasionally hard-to-read story about a girl living with anxiety and OCD. While neither the protagonist nor the simple plot is as initially engaging as those in The Fault in Our Stars or Paper Towns, the story takes off once Aza rediscovers Davis. They're both half-orphaned and lost, but for different reasons. An avid astronomer, Davis looks up to the stars, whereas Aza concentrates on her self -- or selves, since she's focused on her body as a biodome for microorganisms (the body being roughly 10 percent human and 90 percent microbial). Green brings them together in a sweetly romantic way, but the romance is somewhat doomed, considering Aza's myriad neuroses (kissing, while initially pleasant, turns sour once the intrusive thoughts about the billions of bacteria they've shared begin).
For a book less than 300 pages long, Turtles All the Way Down requires a lot of unpacking and invites the reader to think, think, think about everything from mental illness to first love to the intricacies of Star Wars mythology. Like Aza's unique name (from A to Z and back again), there are endless possibilities for conversation points stemming from Green's themes. There are also extended therapy sessions, mini-lessons on the biological importance of the tuatara (a nearly extinct lizard-like creature that lives past 150 years and is actually more like a dinosaur than a lizard), and a great deal of existential angst. Green inserts gentle doses of humor, usually courtesy of Aza's vivacious best friend Daisy (who writes Star Wars fanfiction as a hobby), but this is ultimately a dark book about the trappings of mental illness. It also has one of the most memorable endings in young adult literature. Green's books aren't about happily ever afters but about the hope and love of moving forward, no matter how difficult that might seem.","Parents need to know that Turtles All the Way Down is best-selling author John Green's first novel since 2012's runaway success, The Fault in Our Stars. While that book tackled the issue of teens with cancer, this book centers on  protagonist suffering from anxiety and obsessive-compulsive thoughts and behavior. Green, who has publicly shared he also has OCD, based the main character's struggles on his own lived experience. As in all of Green's books, the teen characters are unabashed nerds: incredibly intelligent, well read, and able to discuss everything from architecture and visual art to philosophy and microbiology with as much ease as they talk about Star Wars trivia and the joys of fanfiction. There is nothing age-inappropriate in the book, so expect a smattering of strong language (including occasional use of ""f--k"" and ""s--t"") and some brief kissing scenes, but no sex. Parents who read this book with their teens should have a host of topics to discuss with them, starting with the importance of adolescent mental health.

The main character, Gemma Stone, is having a defining year in which she finds herself outside of her safety zone, giving up old ways of thinking, and growing up a lot.
The book is touching and laugh-out-loud funny. Shanahan finds a way to mix a ridiculous wedding, a class war/food fight among students, a Shakespearean play, and profiles of three very different families into a believable vehicle in which Gemma is being taken for a ride. As the story is set in Australia, there's some slang or colloquialisms that may be foreign to many readers, but overall the book is universal in its themes.","Parents need to know there is domestic violence and teen drug use in this book.

"Legacy: Keeper of the Lost Cities, Book 8",Action-packed return to form in elf-girl epic series.,"In the wake of Book 7's shocker ending, Sophie Foster is trying to come to terms with her LEGACY -- which includes being ""unmatchable"" with any potential elvin partner because her biological parents are unknown,and apparently want to keep it that way. This definitely puts a crimp in her budding romance with Fitz, while other love interest Keefe says it won't matter to anyone who really cares about her. Meanwhile, Sophie's got other things to deal with as the evil Neverseen rally their forces and enslave one of her friends, and she finds herself facing the challenges of leadership, enhanced powers, and new possibilities as the characters race headlong to another cliffhanger ending.
","Book 8 in the Keeper of the Lost Cities series ups the ante with a raft of action, character developments, new magical powers, ethical dilemmas, world-saving, and teen romance. By now we're beginning to suspect that author Shannon Messenger has no intention of wrapping up the series in this lifetime, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. This year's doorstop-size volume brings a satisfying immersion in glitter, cosmic conflict, increasingly complex characters, teen anxiety, new magical powers, moral dilemmas, page-turning plot developments, and cliffhanger endings. Sophie and her friends battle evil, question authority, and struggle to do the right thing in impossible situations yet again, and many peripheral characters from previous installments make return appearances.","Parents need to know that Legacy, Book 8 in the Keeper of the Lost Cities series, continues the saga of Sophie Foster, a teen girl who's discovered that she's been genetically engineered by elves for some yet-to-be-determined world-saving task. There's plenty of action, between the visits to locations from the underground kingdom of the dwarves to downtown London. And there's romantic tension as Sophie and love interest Fitz grapple with boyfriend-girlfriend social issues and misunderstandings, while other love interest Keefe provides unwavering support. Part of the plot involves Sophie's quest to find her biological parents, and many of the issues, decisions, and feelings will be relevant and relatable to many adopted kids. Along the way, in a fast-moving plot that takes place over a few days and delivers yet another cliffhanger ending, there's a lot of adventure, magic, and self-discovery as dark forces threaten and harm Sophie's family and friends, and she faces life-changing decisions. Lots of combat, imprisonment, peril, and villains who get their way by threatening their victims' loved ones. The romantic tension involves a kiss that may or may not ever happen. There's also a bit of pee and poop humor.

A centuries-old vampire trying to pass at a ritzy New York high school. A dark-skinned god who pops up in the passenger seat next to a guy who's feeling sorry for himself in the Oakland hills and promises him a heroic death. This is all just a taste of this collection of stories, based on Asian myths and traditional tales, and given a new spin by modern authors including Melissa de la Cruz, Elsie Chapman, Julie Kagawa, and others, who deliver page-turning plots and lots to think about.
","There's a lot to love in this collection of Asian myths and legends, retold, re-imagined, and re-examined by authors delving into their cultural roots. Myths of cosmic battle and love gone awry find surprising new forms in A Thousand Beginnings and Endings. And, as in The Chronicles of Harris Burdick, it's fascinating to watch noted authors spin new stories around old material, and explain what inspired them. With everything from science fiction and high school social woes to doomed lovers in dystopian worlds, different readers will be drawn in by different stories -- but then find plenty more to explore and like.","Parents need to know that A Thousand Beginnings and Endings, edited by Ellen Oh and Elsie Chapman (who also contributes a story), is a multi-genre anthology of short stories by modern YA authors of Asian heritage.

The collected stories range from ghost lovers and star-crossed romance to android wars, virtual reality, and the social complications of high school. The storytelling is a treat; readers already familiar with the legends will get a kick out of the new treatments, and those new to the tales and the cultures will find lots to explore. There's occasional strong language (including ""f--k"" and ""s--t"") in some stories and gore here and there, some lovers who have children, a boozy-druggy dance party, and lots of death, some of it violent.

Hannah and Becky are saved by a pair of thylacines, canine-like carnivorous marsupials (extinct starting in about 1936) called Tasmanian tigers because of their striped coats. Enduring tremendous hardship without warm clothes or the ability to make fire, and with hope of rescue diminishing, Becky and Hannah learn to survive and thrive thanks to their adoptive wild parents. Soon the girls live and behave like the tigers, eventually even losing their ability to speak. After four years in the wild, they're finally found by Becky's father and abruptly taken back to civilization. Reintegrating into human life proves nearly impossible and comes at a heavy price.
","INTO THAT FOREST carves its own spot among literature's great adventure stories. As fantastic as the events are, author Louis Mowra's unusual, distinctive narrative voice is so believable you'll think it must be a true story. Complicated themes of family, friendship, and loyalty are artfully explored with a visceral and sometimes brutal beauty. By having Hannah tell the story with a young child's understanding, Mowra conveys tremendous depth of feeling without sentimentality. This is not to mention the gripping, lean, fast-paced action that makes it almost impossible to put down.","Parents need to know that Into That Forest graphically depicts life and death in the wilderness. There's a lot of blood and gore that might shock readers of any age, but it's in the context of a survival story. Even the civilized people in the remote, early-20th-century setting have a closer relationship to life and death than we may be accustomed to now, but it's matter of fact in this context: People and animals get shot with hunting rifles, and accidents happen. Hannah uses salty language not to swear but to convey information (""s--t"" and ""piss"" for body functions or product, except one instance of ""pissed off""). The female thylacine is referred to a few times as the ""bitch."" ""T-ts,"" ""damn,"" ""hell,"" and ""arse"" are used once or twice each. Indigenous people are several times referred to as ""black fellas"" without racist undertones. There are mentions of adults drinking beer or whiskey. A man shows a girl his genitals and points to hers in an asexual attempt to communicate about gender without language. Main characters die violently and tragically, and readers may shed some tears.

"Bad Luck Girl: The American Fairy Trilogy, Book 3",Rousing finish to historical fairy-fantasy trilogy.,"Exiled fairy princess Callie LeRoux is in Hollywood and reunited with the three people who mean the most to her: her long-lost Papa, her devoted Mama, and her longtime friend Jack. But because the magical armies of Faerie are after them, they all must catch a train to New York. Unfortunately, the cold iron in the tracks makes Papa gravely ill, and so they end up stranded halfway across the country, in Chicago. There they find the remnants of Jack's family, as well as a strange, unpredictable community of human/fairy hybrids. As Callie struggles to find a happy ending for everyone, she puts her own life on the line again and again.
","This book brings The American Fairy Trilogy to a rousing, satisfying close, and readers who've followed Callie and Jack from the Dust Bowl to Hollywood and on to Chicago won't be disappointed. This volume is a bit less steeped in historical and mythological lore than are the previous two, but readers familiar with folklore will enjoy identifying some of the obscured supporting characters.
All in all, author Sarah Zettel has done a fine job in creating a series that celebrates both American history and ancient folklore, with a well-realized and nuanced heroine at its center.","Parents need to know that Sarah Zettel's Bad Luck Girl,  the final volume in the American Fairy Trilogy, is an engaging historical fantasy that uses Depression-era Chicago as a well-realized setting for a tale of fairy magic. There's some violence and many magical battles, but the threat of physical violence is more prevalent than is actual bloodshed. The language is quite mild, with a single use of ""ass."" Sexual content is limited to a few kisses between the two lead characters.

Moonshot: The Flight of Apollo 11,"Masterful retelling captures magic, mystery of moon mission.","The historic Apollo 11 mission is retold in free verse from the morning of the launch to the splashdown a week later, with perspectives of what’s happening in space and on Earth.
","Author-illustrator Brian Floca combines gripping narrative with a wealth of detail to deliver a beautifully poetic treatment of Apollo 11. Space and history buffs will find much to sink their teeth into, and anyone who likes a good story will find this compelling. Floca brings alive the electric excitement of 1969 with fluid text and illustrations -- such as a father sinking into his armchair in relief as his family cheers during coverage of the Eagle landing on TV. His phrasing is wonderful. Armstrong reports the landing “calm as a man who just parked a car”; the rocket ""rides a flapping, cracking flame""; the astronauts on the moon gaze toward ""family, friends, and strangers, everyone you've ever known, everyone you might -- the good and lonely Earth, glowing in the sky.""
Finely detailed artwork captures both the spectacular magnitude of the event, from liftoff to landing, and the fine details curious kids may spend hours exploring. The inside covers offer more to explore: In front, Floca provides a visual explanation of how Apollo 11 operated; in back, a detailed narrative of the event. This would be a treat to read with adults who remember Apollo 11.  ","Parents need to know that Moonshot, by Caldecott Medal-winner Brian Floca (Locomotive) focuses on the awe-inspiring momentousness of the Apollo 11 mission.

Flora and the Penguin,Girl gets a skating partner in wintry wordless whirl.,"Flora goes for a skate on natural outdoor ice, and suddenly a penguin pops out of a watery hole in the ice. She finds the bird a perfect partner for pair skating. They do all their graceful moves in unison until the penguin tries a spin and plunges plunges back through the hole. Soon it pops back up with a fish in its beak for Flora. She accepts it but then tosses it back in the hole, angering the penguin. So Flora removes a skate and uses her pom-pom-tipped shoelace as a fishing line. They work together to catch the fish, patch up their friendship, and return to skating happily together. ","Like Flora and the Flamingo, the delightful FLORA AND THE PENGUIN says a whole lot without using any words. Author-illustrator Molly Idle show these two just-met friends going through a range of emotions as they play together -- and apart -- on (and under) the ice. Kids will relate to the push-pull fight-and-make-up nature of many playdates. This book's pastel blue-and-white palette is as perfect for a winter skating story as previous outing's pastel pink-and-white was for its summer swimming story. And once again, well-placed flaps add dimension to shifting emotions and help drive the narrative.

"Jackaby, Book 1",Delightfully creepy 1890s mystery has some light horror.,"After traveling across Europe, Abigail Rook sails to New England in search of fresh adventure. With no luck finding a job in a strange place, she responds to an ad for an investigative assistant and meets the eccentric Mr. Jackaby, a private investigator who describes himself as a man of science who sees things others do not. Abigail's first day on the job lands her right in the middle of a murder investigation, and when a second victim is discovered, the only thing that's clear is that there are powerful, otherworldly forces at work.
","William Ritter's debut novel introduces a colorful, eccentric new detective whose mysterious antics confound and intrigue.

Bad Kitty Drawn to Trouble,Zany hijinks disguise terrific storytelling lesson.,"In BAD KITTY DRAWN TO TROUBLE, author-illustrator Nick Bruel first introduces himself and then takes readers through a Bad Kitty story, introducing Kitty as the main character and proposing a few ideas for settings before deciding on Kitty's home. The story needs conflict: Kitty loves to eat, but she needs to go on a diet. Puppy comes in as the antagonist who eats all of Kitty's food. She faints from shock, and the author proposes putting her on an all-turnip diet to recover. Kitty packs her bags to leave, but a giant octopus at the door forces her back. Bruel brings it all together for a closed ending, with Kitty now loving turnips -- but Kitty doesn't like that ending and convinces him to bring back her usual heaping pile of cat food.
","Bad Kitty Drawn to Trouble is a brilliant bit of inspiration for budding writers. As he did in Bad Kitty for President, which deftly demystified U.S. politics, Nick Bruel lures readers with slapstick humor, then serves up a solid lesson on writing before they even realize they're learning. Bad Kitty is her usual cantankerous self, bristling at her creator's manipulations. Uncle Murray steps in to explain plot versus theme, closed versus open endings, and how a writer makes use of a dictionary, thesaurus, and rhyming dictionary.
 At the book's end, a character accuses the author of stealing the idea for the interplay between creator and character from Looney Tunes shorts. Bruel says those cartoons inspired him but he didn't copy them, and he encourages readers to write Bad Kitty books. A small quibble: If Bruel had shared his inspiration upfront, it would have been a good lesson on acknowledging source material. Bonus: At the end there's a recipe for roasted turnips. ","Parents need to know that although Bad Kitty Drawn to Trouble is enjoyable and funny as an illustrated book, it's really a very smart guide to writing stories. Bad Kitty lives up to her name: She's grouchy, uncooperative, and uninterested in playing well with others, and that's the central conflict driving the humor. The author-illustrator pays homage to classic Looney Tunes shorts by teasing and manipulating Kitty to illustrate his points.

Brothers at Bat: The True Story of an Amazing All-Brother Baseball Team,Heartwarming true story of brothers and teammates.,"BROTHERS AT BAT: THE TRUE STORY OF AN AMAZING ALL-BROTHER BASEBALL TEAM tells the story of the Acerra brothers, who played on a baseball team together as children and young adults. The story begins in the 1920s; the boys progress from backyard games to high school team sports, and then to semi-professional ball in 1938, when the oldest nine brothers formed a touring team. Along the way, the brothers display exemplary teamwork and good sportsmanship. In 1939, the Acerras appear at the World's Fair in New York, where they're honored as New Jersey's biggest family. Later, Albert Acerra is hit in the face with a pitch during a game and loses an eye. All of Albert's brothers work with him slowly until he acclimates to playing with his eye patch. Then, in the '40s, baseball play is interrupted when six of the Acerra brothers join the military. After World War II, all of the brothers return home safely and go on to play baseball for several more years, this time with one of the oldest brothers coaching. The Acerras play their last game as a team in 1952. They're honored as the longest-running all-brother team by the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1997. An author's note at the end of the book explains how author Audrey Vernick met two of the brothers and learned about their lives.
","Brothers at Bat is a charming, inspiring family history that will fascinate young baseball fans. The story and vintage-style illustrations of a dozen brothers sleeping two to a bed, forming a team, and going off to war together sets this unique story in its period, so history lovers will enjoy the book as well. Most important, the Acerras exemplify real ""family values"" of kindness, citizenship, and good sportsmanship, which will encourage youngsters to be kinder siblings and better teammates.","Parents need to know that Brothers at Bat: The True Story of an Amazing All-Brother Baseball Team is a picture book that tells the true-life story of the Acerra brothers, America's longest-running all-brothers baseball team.

","GOSSIE is a simple, unassuming tale of a gosling's everyday life, but it packs big messages about taking the high road, dealing with frustrations, and being a good friend. The tales are not particularly suspenseful -- in this case, Gossie simply enjoys her red boots every day until one day she can't find them.

Crictor,A snake in the mail becomes part of a family.,"Tomi Ungerer's story of the snake that arrived by parcel post and became a member of the household is mirthful and gladdening. The spindly lines of Ungerer's illustrations are ideal for conveying the snake's sinuous progress, and his dry humor lets the story's queer circumstances feel quite natural, even when Crictor is disarming a robber or teaching kids the alphabet.
 ","Much of the pleasure of this book has to do with composure. Crictor's cool, as though it is standard procedure for a snake to be posted to a French village from Africa. And Madame Bodot is, for the most part (after some mild flapping when she opens the package Crictor comes in) unflappably self-possessed as she introduces the boa into her daily routine. Aplomb -- even the word sounds French.
Tomi Ungerer's artwork has that beguiling and otherworldly pen-and-ink charm reminiscent of Shel Silverstein and Edward Gorey. It is a world of creaky, economical lines, slightly off true, just like how you wanted your grandmother's house to be. And you can't help but grin that it is a snake that lies behind the learning of those letters and numbers, a snake on the page being worth any number in the grass.","Parents need to know that the ironic delivery of this preposterous story gives it a special charm, while the artwork, with its scratchy line work and humorous imagery, might have used Crictor's clever tongue as a brush.

The Beautiful,"Steamy, atmospheric paranormal romance set in New Orleans.","THE BEAUTIFUL starts with Celine Rousseau, a French, half-East Asian, half-white 17-year-old who flees Paris after surviving a personal tragedy in 1872. Arriving in New Orleans, Celine lives in a convent of Ursuline nuns who take in six wayward girls. Celine quickly becomes involved in the glamorous group La Cour des Lions who seem like a salon of rich, international hedonists after she crosses paths with its leader, the sexy and mysterious Sébastien (""Bastien"") Saint Germain and his sisterly best friend Odette, who's the kind of independent, empowered woman Celine wishes she had the freedom to become. When the dead body of one of the girls from the convent is found in the La Cour headquarters, it's clear there's a killer on the loose, and Celine could be next.
","Author Renée Ahdieh pays homage to Anne Rice's thrillers in this period New Orleans-set vampire romance that features a clever, diverse, and sexy cast of characters. In her author letter, Ahdieh acknowledges how much she loved Rice's Vampire Chronicles (the most famous of which is Interview With a Vampire), and it's clear she is in some way recreating and refreshing Rice's themes and locations in The Beautiful. Even the title is familiar -- both a description of the gorgeous La Cour de Lions crowd and a nod to F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Beautiful and the Damned (The Damned is also the name of this book's follow-up, out in June, 2020). But instead of being about rich young socialites who suffer a downfall in Jazz Age New York, this is about a young woman caught up in the world of rich supernatural socialites in post-Civil War NOLA.
Ahdieh is wonderful at building romantic tension, and Celine and Bastien share a palpable slow-burn chemistry from their first encounter onward. Occasionally there are repetitious descriptions of Bastien's devilish charm, Celine's ""inner creature"" (obviously her growing desire), and their push-and-pull feelings for each other. Most of the characters have culturally diverse backgrounds, New Orleans having been a melting pot of that era, and both Celine and Bastien speak more than English on a regular basis. The pacing adds to the sense of peril and the mystery of who is committing all the heinous crimes. As for the romance, the burgeoning love triangle is an unwelcome but standard feature in speculative teen fiction. One minor complaint is that while Celine's and Bastien's ages make sense, the age of Michael, Celine's other suitor and Bastien's best-friend turned rival, seems unrealistically young (teen detectives?). It's also hard to believe anyone would want Celine and Michael to end up together, no matter how great his Italian grandmother is in that one scene. Ahdieh captures the spirit of New Orleans and the allure of being free of societal restrictions based on gender, class, or perceived virtue. Readers will be ready for the next and final installment, which should answer burning questions and result in a happier ending.
 ","Parents need to know that The Beautiful is a New Orleans-set paranormal romance inspired by author Renée Ahdieh's love of Anne Rice's best-selling Vampire Chronicles series. The main character, Celine, is a mixed-race (White and East-Asian) young French woman who has had to flee Paris for New Orleans in 1872. After arriving at the convent that will serve as her home, she meets a mysterious, handsome man and his circle of close friends -- who seem almost otherworldly (spoiler alert: They are!). Like most paranormal romances, there is some bloody violence (people have their throats sliced open, limbs and other body parts are detached, including a severed head, people are shot) as well as sexual assault, intimidation, and the turning of a human into a vampire. The language is occasionally but not frequently strong (a couple of uses of ""f--k,"" ""shit,"" and the like), and there are a lot of suggestive scenes that focus on feelings of attraction and desire. One particularly passionate make-out session includes positive consent modeling but stops short of sex. Readers will learn about 19th-century New Orleans, which is described in so much detail it becomes another central character in the story.

Way Up and Over Everything,"Folktale about hope, flying, and the magic of storytelling.","Passed down from the author's great-grandmama's mama, this is a ""flying"" story. As a girl, and a slave in Georgia, Jane witnessed the arrival of 5 new Africans to the plantation, and at the end of the first day sees them escape in the most amazing way. Words and pictures describe the operation of the plantation, the use of the whip, dogs, and threats, as well as the magic of the escape. The final pages explain more about these kinds of folktales and how the author came upon this one.
","Though this inviting folktale is about slavery in America, it's more about the magic and wonderment of a ""flying"" story born out of the African people's desperate ""wish for freedom."" The belief that some oppressed people could escape by flying away ""way up and over everything"" was, and still is, a means of keeping hope alive in a world that was degrading and dispiriting.
The teller, Alice McGill, is a gifted storyteller who tells her tale with a warmth that is both dramatic and inspiring. Readers will imagine themselves sitting at her knee, listening to her every word. And, they will find themselves moved by her tone that is enriched with the oral tradition that passed the story down to her. Watercolor landscapes, subtly toned and peopled by elongated figures that seem small and almost lost in the world, add to the magic of the message, and make this a book to be cherished.","Parents need to know that this book is about slavery and may invite questions from kids.

Liberal touches of humor keep readers rolling with laughter.

The Mighty Miss Malone,Unforgettable 12-year-old girl battles the Great Depression.,"In May 1936, 12-year-old Deza Malone may be poor, but she's living a fairly secure, happy life in Gary, Ind., as the brightest student in her class and the beloved child of doting parents. But the Great Depression hits the family hard, first driving her father away from town in search of work, then Deza, her brother, and her mother after him when he disappears. Trouble and hardship follow, in which not only poverty but also racial prejudice play a role -- as does the kindness of strangers.
","Deza is an unforgettable character whose perspective on historical events is by turns entertaining and provocative. Curtis' previous book, Bud, Not Buddy, in which young Deza makes an appearance, won both the Newbery Medal and the Coretta Scott King Award, among other honors, so THE MIGHTY MISS MALONE is in good company. As the story progresses, young readers will have frequent occasion to contemplate what it might have been like, for example, to be in constant pain because half their teeth were rotting away. ","Parents need to know that positive messages abound in this tale of family tenacity in the Great Depression, but some of the misfortunes and hardships that befall the the Malone family are quite harrowing (e.g. losing their home, Mr. Malone's physical and mental deterioration) and may be troubling to more sensitive younger readers. The vivid snapshots of everyday life, main character Deza's exuberant, malapropism-laden love of language and learning, and the sudden dissonance of clashing worlds (say, the world of the Malones, and the world of the banker's family for whom Mrs. Malone cleans house) all add enjoyment, irony and interest to the story for thoughtful readers.

The Miscalculations of Lightning Girl,"Math whiz gets out of comfort zone in smart, touching story.","In THE MISCALCULATIONS OF LIGHTNING GIRL, Lucy survived a lightning strike that left her with genius-level math talent -- and obsessive compulsive disorder. She's only 12 and capable of starting college, but her grandmother enrolls her in middle school to spend time with kids her age. Though Lucy downplays her math skills to try to fit in, she can't hide her OCD routines from snickering classmates. She falls into friendship with kind Windy, who wants to save the world, and cynical Levi, who regards everyone through his camera lens. As they work together on a service project at a local shelter, Lucy struggles to unlock the right formula to manage the everyday ups and downs of middle school.
","In her remarkable, heartfelt first middle-grade book, Stacy McAnulty shares the beauty and joy of math alongside the illogic of trying to calculate teh best path to navigate relationships and life. The Miscalculations of Lightning Girl sets up a fantastic premise -- a girl whose brain was rewired by a lightning strike -- and builds to a sweet, satisfying payoff. Lucy feels alone but shares the worries of every middle-schooler: wanting to be her unique self without being seen as different. Aside from the cookie-cutter mean-girl melodrama, the novel is enriched by diverse, authentic supporting characters who have their own challenges.
Even the math-averse will appreciate how McAnulty (Earth! My First 4.54 Billion Years) describes Lucy's perspective, where numbers are a colorful canvas and patterns bring comfort and understanding. This is a wonderful book to inspire readers to see the world -- and the people in it -- with fresh eyes.","Parents need to know that The Miscalculations of Lightning Girl is about a home-schooled math whiz with obsessive compulsive disorder trying to get by in middle school.

(""Hi Koo!"" as in haiku -- the younger Panda only speaks in that short poetic form.) Koo and the neighborhood kids reach out to a grouchy neighbor with what might be surprising results for kids who haven't read this kind of fable before.
Like many sequels, ZEN TIES isn't as good as the original, but it holds up on its own.

His sepia-toned sketches add emotion to Annie's story, bringing it to life more so than his words. Though readers may wonder why Annie came up with the idea for her daredevil feat, they are sure to be drawn into her unique story. The terrified look on her face as she begins her journey toward the brink of the fall will captivate any reader's attention.  Chris Van Allsberg's amazing sepia-toned sketches express all the sights, sounds, and emotions of the story. As readers look at the falls, they can hear the thundering sounds and realize the terror of what Annie is about to undertake. The drawings of Annie backing into the barrel looking more like a schoolmarm than a daredevil, or of the terrified look on her face as she begins her journey, tell a part of the story that words cannot express. That Allsberg actually modeled Annie on his daughter's teacher, and had her act out the scenes that he drew, accounts for some of the realism he captures.   ","Parents need to know that this is the true story of a 62-year-old woman who became the first person to ride over Niagara Falls in a barrel. Whether her daredevil feat should be commended as courageous or questioned as insane is something the reader will have to decide. The story, though, is fascinating. So is the sensitive sepia-toned artwork by Chris Van Allsburg. The text is developed enough to makes this a good read-aloud for younger kids but still meaty enough for the mid-grade reader.

Someday This Pain Will Be Useful to You,"Powerful, mature book about bright teen's alienation.","This book by adult novelist Peter Cameron has no real plot, but here goes: James, recently graduated from high school, is accepted at Brown, poised on the edge of adulthood, and not at all happy to be there. He doesn't want to go to college; he wants to buy a house in a small Midwest town, where he can avoid dealing with people, whom he doesn't understand and who don't understand him. His mother has just split with her third husband -- on their honeymoon. His father is a powerful but detached lawyer. His parents, both fairly self-involved and clueless, are worried enough about him to send him to a psychiatrist. In between sessions he works, or pretends to work, at his mother's failing art gallery, and wonders how he can be a part of a world that makes him sad and uncomfortable.
","James will touch the patient reader with his desperate sadness, discomfort, dark humor, self-awareness, and fear. Like Holden Caulfield, James is a bright, financially well-off New Yorker who has had a breakdown of sorts, stemming both from a general sense of disconnection from humanity and from a specific traumatic event that is only gradually revealed. Like Holden, his inner monologues and way of looking at the adult world will sound familiar and ring true.
The adults in James' life, including his ineffectual psychiatrist, care in a distant sort of way, and readers may long to shake them out of their narcissistic stupors. The ending, such as it is, comes abruptly and doesn't really resolve anything. Perhaps it's this all-too-realistic touch, along with its sophisticated verbal style, that makes this funny, moving novel seem, like James himself, not to belong to its peer group.","Parents need to know that this is a compelling coming-of-age story, but its content and subtle storytelling make it a better choice for mature teens. There is a fair amount of swearing and many sexual references (including the main character's possible homosexual orientation), but no sexual activity. There's also drinking and a lot of product name-dropping. James is a relatable narrator who is funny and insightful -- and the feeling he has of being alone in the world is a pretty universal one.

The Last Kids on Earth Series,"Post-apocalyptic romp has humor and heart, kids and zombies.","Trying to stay safe in a town full of the undead, 13-year-old Jack and his friends soon realize they are THE LAST KIDS ON EARTH. Jack treats the whole thing like a video game, complete with race courses and challenges for points, and with his best friend Quint builds an epically cool tree fort, makes friends with the town’s monsters, and tries to figure out how to survive. Along the way they join forces with the few remaining kids in town: Dirk, the school bully and June, Jack’s crush and a fierce and focused fighter. The kids try to slay the unrelenting army of zombies and stay alive while an ancient evil king won’t stop trying to devour all of planet Earth. ","With eye-catching illustrations on every page and funny dialogue among friends, it would be easy to dismiss this series as standard zombie fare. Jack is out to have fun, and everything is a game to him. But The Last Kids on Earth series delves deep into the minds and hearts of the kids who are fighting for their lives while trying to eat as much junk food as possible. Jack is a foster kid who's had a rough time in the foster care system. His best friend, Quint, is full of quirks, Dirk is the school bully, and June rarely admits she needs help.
The Jack-June portrayal gets better over time, but in the beginning, Jack treats her like something to be won (“I call dibs on her”) and doesn’t listed when she tells him to go away. She sets a boundary and he blows right past it -- hardly the example to show readers navigating their own crushes. Despite the way this stereotypical boy-girl crush plays out, the series is a magnificent, funny, fast-paced look at emotions, expectations, and how building the tree fort of your dreams can really be all you ever hoped. And zombies. Don’t forget the zombies.","Parents need to know that Max Brallier’s The Last Kids on Earth series has more humor, character development, and heart than anyone would expect from an adventure featuring drooling monsters and a zombie apocalypse. Jack and fellow 13-year-old survivors cover a surprising amount of emotional ground: Bravery and vulnerability go hand-in-hand, everyone has something to offer the group, crushes can complicate friendships even when you’re fighting the undead together, and treating life as a video game can be cool, but sometimes it’s important to take things seriously. The series is packed with snarky monster fun and great illustrations while delivering on some big themes of friendship, loss, and what it means to be brave. Unfortunately, in the beginning, Jack also shows an antiquated take on how boys treat girls: He has a crush on June and wants to rescue her, but when she says she doesn’t need rescuing, his response is to ignore her wishes and keep pushing into her life. June’s role as a zombie fighter expands and Jack’s attitude toward her matures in later books. The series has been adapted for a TV series on Netflix, set to premiere Sept. 17, 2019, the same day the fifth book in the series is published: The Last Kids on Earth and the Midnight Blade.

Children of Eden,Familiar dystopian tale pushes limits of believability.,"CHILDREN OF EDEN is set a few hundred years from now, after Earth's natural resources have been destroyed and only a tiny fraction of humanity has been saved. Rowan is a second child, someone who should not be allowed to exist. After 16 years of being hidden away in her parents' home, she's suddenly thrust into the world outside, where nothing makes sense and every action is fraught with danger. As she struggles to figure out whom to trust, she moves ever closer to a startling secret that could change civilization forever.
","This perplexing novel uses every convention of dystopian YA science fiction: confused but tough female lead, authoritarian villains, romantic triangles, vast conspiracies. These elements are so familiar, it's hard to tell whether the use of obvious cliché is intentional or not. In any case, the novel pushes the limits of believability. Children of Eden's main character, Rowan, is sympathetic, but she never seems to stop talking and stating the obvious. The world-building doesn't seem to make much sense, and coincidence seems to be the major motivator of the plot. Many readers will no doubt be attracted by the story's breathless earnestness, but the more critical among them may roll their eyes.
Beware that the book ends in a cliffhanger, even though there's no warning that this is the first volume in a series.","Parents need to know that Children of Eden, written by social media and YouTube celebrity Joey Graceffa with Laura L. Sullivan, is a science-fiction thriller set in a dystopian environment where Earth's natural habitat is presumed destroyed. It contains some violence -- including torture similar to waterboarding and the semi-accidental slitting of a character's throat. There are a few passionate kisses; the only strong language is four or five uses of ""hell."" Although it's not explicitly branded as such, Children of Eden seems to be the first volume of a series.

"The Golem's Eye (The Bartimaeus Trilogy, Book 2)","Bartimaeus returns -- alas, not to center stage.","Nathaniel, the main human character (though certainly not the hero) of the first book, is now the youngest junior minister ever in the government of an alternative British Empire run by magicians. To him falls the job of dealing with the increasingly annoying anti-magician resistance movement. When the destruction grows in scale, no one will believe Nathaniel that it's unrelated to the resistance, that it is in fact the work of a golem, controlled by a traitor in the government. So he summons Bartimaeus, as snide and reluctant as ever, and travels to Prague to find the secret of the golem.
Meanwhile Kitty, a member of the commoner resistance introduced briefly in the first book, is part of a group planning to raid Gladstone's tomb for artifacts of great power. Both her plans and Nathaniel's go badly wrong, setting the stage for a climactic confrontation with the golem.
","The good news is that Bartimaeus is back; the bad news is that there's not enough of him. What made the first book in this series a standout was his sarcastic commentary, self-aggrandizing descriptions, witty banter, and delightful footnotes detailing the workings of magic and demons in this alternative world. They're all still here, just less of them.
Meanwhile Nathaniel and Kitty alternately take center stage in a complex and often exciting, if too loosely edited, adventure involving, among many other things, grave-robbing, a demon living in Gladstone's bones, political intrigue, war, werewolf police, destruction, and a shadowy figure who seems to be playing all sides like puppets. Nathaniel, one of the least likeable main characters in children's literature, continues to fascinate and frustrate the reader with his growing power -- and obtuseness. The stage is clearly set for a grand finale in Book 3, presumably including Nathaniel's reclamation.","Parents need to know that this book is full of amoral and immoral characters.

Closer to home for 14-year-old apprentice Christopher Rowe is the fact that ""in the past four months, five men had been butchered in their homes. Each of them had been tied up, tortured, then slit open at the stomach and left to bleed to death.""  Then his beloved master, apothecary Benedict Blackthorn, becomes the latest victim, leaving Christopher a note in code inscribed ""nemini dixeris"" (""tell no one"" in Latin). Soon Christopher and his best friend Tom are trying to decipher THE BLACKTHORN KEY, solve the murders, and stay alive s they unearth a plot that threatens not only the king but the entire world.
","First-time author Kevin Sands delivers irresistible characters, cool knowledge, intrigue, and lots of explosions as a 17th-century apprentice tries to solve his master's murder. Over the course of this exciting page-turner, readers will learn quite a bit about day-to-day life in 17th-century London, secret messages in code and Latin, and chemistry. Purists might quibble about the occasional anachronism, such as referring to characters ""aging out"" of an orphanage, but it's for a good cause: making a lot of potentially forbidding knowledge not only accessible but also spellbinding.
Parents be warned: There are definite ""kids, don't try this at home"" moments. It's nothing they can't find on the Web any day, but The Blackthorn Key includes detailed recipes for explosives, particularly gunpowder and something like nitroglycerin. Some of the compounds are described with archaic names such as ""aqua fortis"" (nitric acid).","Parents need to know that The Blackthorn Key, the opener of  new series by brilliant first-time author Kevin Sands, is an irresistible mix of history (it's set in the England of Charles II), science, staunch friendship, swashbuckling thrills, world saving, and comic misadventure. Besides deadly political intrigue of the day, the plot involves multiple murders, some with brief gory detail; hand-to-hand combat; and a scene in which a villain tortures the protagonist by pouring acid on his skin. Expect many references to pee and poop, often as ingredients in chemical compounds or part of the pre-plumbing, 17th-century local scenery.

Stitches: A Memoir,Powerful look at abusive childhood for mature readers only.,"David Small grows up sickly and is treated by his radiologist father with radiation while emotionally starved by his repressed and unhappy mother. A growth on his neck is diagnosed as benign at age 11, but his parents delay surgery for three years, stating expense as an excuse. Surgery at 14 reveals cancer that is kept secret from him; David loses his thyroid, vocal cord, and his voice. Anger at his parents increases when he finds his mother in bed with another woman and he begins to act out. His grandmother goes insane and tries to burn up his grandfather, his father admits his guilt in David's cancer, and the bad times just keep coming. Kicked out of boarding school, he finds his first supportive adult in his therapist, and a glimmer of hope that he can find a better life.
","STITCHES is elegant both visually and textually, with many heartbreakingly memorable moments. Small deserves recognition for his use of the graphic novel format to create this powerful memoir. Hopefully it will receive the recognition it's due in the world of adult literature.
Teen readers who are ready for the subject matter may frequently find themselves balled up in anger -- just like the many depictions of the author in his childhood as he endures one injustice after another. Child abuse is hard to watch from any vantage point and thankfully Small finds his way out of the cycle and ends the book on a hopeful note. ","Parents need to know that Stitches: A Memoir was originally published as a memoir for adults, but it was a 2009 National Book Award Finalist in the Young Adult category. Technically, it can be called a coming-of-age story, but Small did not write it for a young or even teen audience. As an adult book, it has been accurately called disturbing and cathartic. The horror of a boy being subjected to repeated radiation treatments by his father, losing his vocal cord and ability to speak to cancer at the age of 14, and being lied to about all of it by his parents is nightmarish enough, but the scenes of David finding his mother in bed with another woman, and later his grandmother trying to kill his grandfather in a fire and dancing naked outside the burning house mark it further as a book for very mature readers.

Harry by the Sea,An appealing main character and plenty of action.,"Harry the dog likes the seashore, except the heat. Harry's human family likes everything about Harry, except his tendency to crowd their beach umbrella and wreck their sandcastles.
As Harry sits alone by the water's edge, a big wave crashes over him, leaving him covered with seaweed and looking like ""something from the bottom of the sea."" Now Harry is cool and comfortable--and completely oblivious to the terrifying sight he presents as he runs from one identical striped beach umbrella to another, searching for his family.
Just as Harry is about to be captured and taken to the aquarium as a Bushy-backed Sea Slug, everyone is happily reunited at a hot-dog stand. For their next trip to the seaside, Harry's family buys a brand-new beach umbrella: big enough to cover everyone--including Harry--and easy for Harry to find, because, like him, it's white with black spots.
","From a hot dog (Harry) to a hot-dog stand, HARRY BY THE SEA captures not only the fun but also the potential mishaps of a family outing to the seaside. Any child who has ever been lost in a crowd will identify with Harry's attempt to find his family amid the almost indistinguishable humans on the beach. The text softens Harry's plight by giving the panic to the people, who think Harry is a scary sea monster, and by reassurances that his family has been searching for him, too.
Humorous touches -- both textual and visual -- abound, such as the expressions and gestures of illustrator Margaret Bloy Graham's bathers and Harry's mistaking the hot-dog man's cry of ""Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!"" for ""Harry! Harry! Harry!"" A big orange sun shines down in every one of Graham's illustrations, making the crowded beach setting cheery. Children love Graham's drawings, but adults will also appreciate a certain satiric edge in her portrayal of humans' herdlike behavior.","Parents need to know that an appealing main character and plenty of action (reinforced by the lively illustrations) power this story along, keeping children involved in the narrative language and resolution of the story conflict. This tale of mistakes (and mistaken identity) will elicit out-loud laughter, while Margaret Bloy Graham's deceptively simple, softly colored drawings emphasize the humor.

Love and Other Train Wrecks,"Road trip romance is engaging, sometimes predictable.","In LOVE AND OTHER TRAIN WRECKS, Ammy (17) and Noah (18) meet on an Amtrak train during winter break. Noah is desperate to get home to surprise his ex-girlfriend, and hopefully win her back. Ammy's lso desperate to get to her father's wedding on time, and she's especially excited to spend more time with her soon-to-be stepsister, Kat. The train suddenly stops in the middle of nowhere, and officials predict it'll take several hours to get the train moving again. Noah convinces Ammy they can catch a bus that'll beat the train, and all they have to do is get off and hike a mile through the woods. One wrong turn leads to another, of course. As their adventure continues over the course of 24 hours, they start to fall for each other. They resist as long as they can, but just when they can't help falling truly and deeply in love, Ammy learns  devastating truth that means she can never see Noah again.
","Author Leah Konen gives romance fans a fun and engaging story, if not a very original one, that'll charm fans even as they easily predict what happens next. Love and Other Train Wrecks manages to feel just fresh enough, thanks to the quirky, well-developed Ammy and Noah. Switching back and forth between their points of view helps us get to know them better, keeps the story moving, and even provides a few laughs as we see how they say or don't say what they mean, and (mis)interpret each other's words and actions.
Konen's got most of the boxes checked that romance fans are looking for. Meet cute? Check. Tormented by the past? Check. Crazy family? Check. Unaware of how attractive they are? Check. Readers who aren't romance fans, or who aren't willing to just go along for the ride, may find so many clichés exasperating. But teens who love romance and adventure will enjoy Ammy and Noah's story right through to the end.","Parents need to know that Love and Other Train Wrecks is a road trip romance between 17-year-old Ammy and college freshman Noah, and it's a fine choice for teen romance fans. Sexual content is mild, with no graphic or extended descriptions, but kissing for hours is mentioned and a ""hookup"" is an important part of Noah's past. Profanity is rare but includes ""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" and variations of each. Overall messages and role models are positive, especially about family loyalty, sacrificing your own happiness to avoid hurting others, and having the courage to stop dwelling on the past.

"A Cold Legacy: The Madman's Daughter, Book 3","High body count, low believability in Frankenstein homage.","After the murders of cruel scientists in London, Juliet needed to disappear in a hurry. The police and some very powerful men who consider themselves above the law will be after her in no time -- especially when they see she's protecting Edward, a creation of her late father, Dr. Moreau, whose diseased brain made him into a notorious serial killer in London. The carriage races away from London with Edward, sick and chained up for everyone's safety; Juliet's fiancé, Montgomery; her friend Lucy; and Balthazar, Juliet's half-animal servant. It's no wonder when they arrive at their friend Elizabeth's isolated manor with a legitimate letter of introduction that the staff is still reluctant to take them in. It's a bad time for introductions anyway: Some villagers just died of the plague, and the staff is hosting the mass funeral in the cellar. And that's not the strangest thing to happen in Juliet's new refuge: Only girls attend school, a boy with one all-white eye roams the secret passageways with a rat on his shoulder, and high up in the locked tower Juliet's friend Elizabeth protects the secrets of her ancestor, one Victor Frankenstein.
","The scope and ambition of the Madman's Daughter trilogy is quite impressive. Author Megan Shepherd had the burden of stringing the heart and soul of three sci-fi classics together using the same main characters. And she had to make those characters meld into each literary world. In A COLD LEGACY, Shepherd introduces the world of Frankenstein's old digs wonderfully. The manor, the flooded moors, all the secret passageways, and the strange people who live there will make the reader dive right into the story. The problem lies in how the characters from the other two Madman books fit in here. The love story between Juliet and Montgomery already feels played out, making Montgomery add little to the story. Then Juliet sneaks around him to toy with secret experiments (ones she completes so quickly -- heart and brain surgery and a transplant in only a few hours, whoa!) and seems suddenly fanatical again just because she has  crazy-scientist father. She doesn't care what her mentor or her future husband will think at all. Not only is three-hour massive surgery rather unbelievable, so is Juliet's moral recovery. ","Parents need to know that A Cold Legacy, the last book in the Madman's Daughter trilogy, is part of a horror-heavy sci-fi series. Each book pays homage to classic sci-fi books. Here the characters move into Dr. Frankenstein's old manor a few generations later. Of course the main character, Juliet, is tempted to bring people back from the dead -- making this a great opportunity for mature readers to contemplate medical ethics. A few gory scenes describe sawing off the head of a corpse before sawing it open, pulling out a pus-filled organ, and reattaching a heart. Plenty more people die, including three close to Juliet, through fire, gunshot, and a heart getting ripped out. Other characters are shot, electrocuted, and killed by the plague. Other mature content includes wedding-night sex that isn't described and the drinking of gin and brandy.

"The Box and the Dragonfly: The Keepers, Book 1",Twisty brainteaser of a fantasy is a keeper.,"On the bus on his way home from school, Horace can't help noticing a sign with his name on it: Horace F. Andrews. How odd. When he hops off the bus to take a closer look, a strange, thin man follows him. He instinctively runs away and happens upon an alley with the sign ""House of Answers."" That must have been what he saw. After he answers a riddle to get in, it just gets weirder. A hallway filled with birdcages and a room with many crazy objects labeled in even crazier ways (""Oblong,"" ""Unsavory,"" ""Misplaced"") awaits him. A woman tells him to sign in and come back the next day. He gets to choose an object and picks a box he can see through. He's not sure what he's seeing but is too intrigued to part with it. At night the experiments begin as he tries to find out what powers the box holds. Little does he know that he's become a Keeper of one of the most powerful and rare objects around. It leads him to a new friend, Chloe, a Keeper with very different powers, and a whole world of Wardens trying to keep creatures like the impossibly thin man away.
","Here's hoping this book finds a large audience; it's a great find for readers who love to puzzle out the twists and turns of a story. Author Ted Sanders is about 10 frustrating steps ahead, no matter how bright you are, and it's all thanks to Horace's ingenious little box. The climax of the story takes up almost the last 100 pages, because readers see through Horace's box a possible outcome a whole day ahead of the main action. From there you'll spend almost as much time speed-reading as you spend pondering, ""Well, if this happens, then this has to happen, but what if ... ?""
At 544 pages, it's a long haul, but it's entertaining most of the way. The time spent developing Horace and Chloe's friendship is definitely worth it. They're a great pair worth rooting for. Sometimes the adults -- such as Mr. Meister -- seem to string out the mystery way longer than needed. Kids are not always patient, especially when adults hold out on the truth. Then the cliffhanger comes on the very last page, guaranteeing that the next book will be another amazing find.","Parents need to know that The Box and the Dragonfly is the first in the Keepers fantasy series about a boy who discovers a magical object with special powers meant only for him and becomes a Keeper. Bad guys want the object -- specifically, a very creepy, impossibly large man smelling of brimstone who's always in pursuit. Plenty of readers will get spooked by him. There's also a house fire, some kidnappings, and fights with golems made of moving rock. When a Keeper's object is stolen, he or she loses hope and almost all sense of self. Horace, who's very bright and careful, and his brave and determined friend Chloe make a loyal team worth rooting for. Book 2 in the series, The Harp and the Ravenine, comes out March 1, 2016.

The Secret World of Hildegard,"Gorgeous artwork, but too ethereal for many kids.","Hildegard von Bingen was a real woman who lived in the Middle Ages and, as a mystic visionary, did amazing things, especially for a woman in those times. This is an attempt to tell the story of her struggle to accept the mysterious power she was given and have the courage to share the visions she saw. It begins with the disturbing visions that terrify her as a child, and then moves with her to the monastery where she is taught as a young girl. There she learns to accept that her visions come from God, and she becomes headmistress as well as a scientist, composer, author, preacher, and more.
","Another collaboration by Jeanette and Jonah Winter, this book has a beautiful, vibrant cover and is filled with amazing, almost folksy, artwork of the kind found in their earlier book Diego. However, the subject matter here is way too ethereal for most picture book readers, and speaks more to those with specific appreciation for or interest in Christian mysticism, losing the rest of readers.
Of course, the story of Hildegard is a complicated one to tell. But, in an attempt to capture the mystical tone of her life, this telling slips into myth bordering on historical inaccuracy. The language seems as if it comes straight from a Nativity play; while it's supposed to convey Hildegard's religious significance, most kids won't understand it, nor will they make sense of the chant that repeats throughout the book or the language that describes the visions, even though both are presented in different fonts meant to set them apart. All in all, this was a courageous and artistic attempt to write about an unusual woman, but while tweens may be intrigued, The Secret World of Hildegard falls short of its aim. To its credit, however, it includes a bibliography at the end for those who want to do further study.","Parents need to know that this biography only gives part of the story of Hildegard and creates a strange, somewhat terrifying, mystical world that might disturb some kids. The book is quite religious in nature and a better fit for those with a specific appreciation for or interest in Christian mysticism.

One Morning in Maine,A warm story about a lost tooth.,"A loose tooth is both scary and fun for a child. Little Sal's fear over her wiggly tooth turns to jubilance and then despair. A lost tooth is also an age marker, and Sal is suddenly a big girl who can help her father and instruct her little sister. Although it's mildly didactic, this warm story generates good feelings.
 ","Robert McCloskey's books are old favorites, and adults enjoy reading them to children. Life in McCloskey's world is fairly safe and peaceful, and always full of natural beauty. The stories make adults remember childhood, and vacations, and simpler moments. And they make today's children feel calm and assured.
ONE MORNING IN MAINE is tender and right on the mark with a child's feelings about a lost tooth and an adventure with Dad. The softness of the pencil drawings perfectly matches the mood of Sal's wonder about life and growing up. Kids laugh at Sal's barrage of questions to her father about animals -- and they gasp when Sal's tooth pops out and sinks into clam-filled mud.","Parents need to know that this long book lacks tension and poetic description, but it portrays the sweet mood of a contented family.

"Can't You Sleep, Little Bear?",As reassuring as a goodnight hug.,"Why is bedtime so frightening? \""I don't like the dark!\"" Little Bear tells Big Bear, who goes to great extents to comfort his charge. Finally, Big Bear makes Little Bear face the dark head on, and this duo finds that there's nothing to fear--as long as they have each other.
 ","As reassuring as a goodnight hug, this sweet tale of a little one's fear of the dark will ring familiar to young listeners and to their parents. Big Bear epitomizes parental devotion, as he goes to any extent to comfort his little charge. This is a good bedtime book, lulling in its repetition, and the children love saying Little Bear's repeated ""I'm afraid!"" each time the reader asks the title question.
The pencil and watercolor illustrations, surrounded by an arch-shaped border, echo the shape of the bears' cave. They are soft in tone and capture the bears' expressions. ""That's just what I do!"" one 4-year-old girl said as she studied the illustrations of Little Bear attempting to fall asleep.

"Moo, Baa, La La La!",Learning animal sounds is easy with fun board book.,"An eclectic mix of animals frolic across the pages of this sparkling board book. Sandra Boynton's bouncy rhymes introduce an assortment of creatures and their signature sounds. A trio of warbling pigs add a dash of surprise and a comic touch that will keep little ones laughing. The artist's whimsically drawn illustrations, featuring merry animals, are beguiling.
 ","MOO, BAA, LA LA LA! is terrific for a broad age range of children. It's entirely functional, introducing tots to animals and teaching them the creatures' sounds. Yet Sandra Boynton's unique style breathes invigorating life into a well-worked format. Even children as young as 6 months old will react to the inflection of the reader's voice repeating the rhymes, and to the vivid art.
The text lends itself to a boisterous read-aloud session, and young children will have oodles of fun providing the animal sounds. In addition to having funny text and Boynton's gleeful illustrations, the pages are drenched in color.

"With Any Luck, I'll Drive a Truck",Rhyming text and trucks galore make natural kid pleaser.,"In WITH ANY LUCK, I'LL DRIVE A TRUCK, a 7-year-old boy describes the various trucks he's learned to drive each year since he was 2. He runs through the roster, which includes construction trucks such as a concrete mixer, backhoe, and bulldozer, some farm trucks such as a combine and plow, and a fire engine. Though the art shows him as a kid driving and maneuvering the trucks with the help of his three animal friends, by the end of the book the trucks are revealed to be toys on his bedroom floor and the animal friends his stuffed animals. The last page shows what he aspires to be, a grown-up truck driver at the wheel of a big rig.
","Working trucks barrel across the pages as a young boy imagines he's driving them and operating their heavy machinery, while the book tells his story in easy-breezy rhyme and bold, bright art. The narrator describes all types of trucks, from farm to construction site, and the art pictures the trucks doing their heavy work. Introduces kids to types and names of trucks, and action verbs used to describe the work, for instance, plowing and baling.
The fun twist at the end -- that the boy hasn't actually been driving the big rigs but playing with toy trucks on his bedroom floor -- underscores the value of play, implicitly supporting the oft-quoted Montessori proposition that ""play is the work of the child."" This is a perfect choice for the legions of truck-obsessed young kids.","Parents need to know that With Any Luck, I'll Drive a Truck, by David Friend and Michael Rex, is a fun rhyming story with enough trucks to satisfy even the most demanding young truck lover. A young boy describes the trucks he's learned to drive each year since he's been 2, including emergency vehicles and construction and farm trucks. At the end, he admits that he might actually learn to drive the trucks ""when I turn 10, or maybe twice the age as then,"" and we see him on his bedroom floor playing with those same trucks pictured as toys.

Oh Say Can You Say?,A volatile stew of festive wordplay.,"Fractured limericks? Tongue twisters? Brain teasers? Dr. Seuss blends the three into a volatile stew of festive wordplay. This book is divided into episodes--""West Beast East Beast,"" ""Eat at Skipper Zipp's,"" and the like--that Seuss uses to create a barely contained visual and verbal tempest.
 ","These forays into tongue-twisting are so good-natured that they can do little but bring a smile to your lips, which doesn't help a whole lot when it comes to trying to get the pronunciation right. Since each of the episodes (for the most part) occupies one two-page spread, they feel self-contained and snappy.
Dr. Seuss' bright colors and bewhiskered creatures are arrayed on a field of white, and the words seem to vibrate on the page, which should be a nuisance but here seems quite fitting.","Parents need to know that Dr. Seuss' Oh Say Can You Say? offers a heap of limericks and tongue twisters for kids to tackle.

"Hello, Goodbye, and Everything In Between",Soon-to-part lovers debate what-ifs in smart romance.,"Clare and Aidan have only 12 hours before they leave their town, their families, and each other to begin college 3,000 miles apart. After two wonderful years together, they're down to their last night – and they still don't know whether they should break up or try to stay together despite the looming physical and emotional distance. Clare, the careful, organized planner, is prepared with an itinerary for the night and an argument for why they should split. Aidan would prefer to see where the night -- and their future -- leads them. As they revisit key moments of their past and contemplate what's in store, they grapple with complicated goodbyes to their friends, their families, and everything familiar.
","This engaging romance is Before Sunrise for teens, chronicling the final night at home for a likable couple trying to imagine their future -- together and apart. Deciding who you want to be isn't done in a vacuum: The people we take with us -- and those we leave behind -- help shape us. In HELLO, GOODBYE, AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN, author Jennifer E. Smith eloquently captures the strange, bittersweet moment when it feels as if your whole life is ahead of you even as the world around you is crumbling.
There's lots of talking but also a fight, a nighttime swim, a candy-shopping spree, and lots of driving, giving the novel a restless energy. Smith gets teens with a genuine authenticity, and Clare and Aidan soon feel like familiar friends. Devoted romantics will swoon, and anxious kids preparing to leave home may find themselves with a playbook for the changes ahead.","Parents need to know that Hello, Goodbye, and Everything In Between is a smartly considered romance by Jennifer E. Smith (The Geography of You and Me). Her college-bound couple is loyal and affectionate, torn between their urge to test their wings -- solo -- and the comfort and support they find in each other. Smith's teen characters are bright and thoughtful, committed to their relationships, and willing to try to ride out the ups and downs. This realistic portrayal has them moving through teen-centric settings out of parents' sight: the neighborhood party house, the basement where they have sex, a quiet spot by the lake. There's underage drinking, a fight, some poor judgment, and a bit of petty theft. Expect occasional coarse language (""hell,"" ""pissed,"" ""prick,"" ""bulls--t""). The book is marketed toward age 12 and up, but the portrayal of teen drinking as de rigueur in a story with such appealing characters might give parents of impressionable tweens pause.

The Night Diary,India-Pakistan religious conflict drives moving family tale.,"It's the summer of 1947, and 12-year-old Nisha writes letters each evening to her long-dead mom in THE NIGHT DIARY. There's a lot to write: India, where she lives with her father (a doctor), her twin brother, and her grandmother, is about to become independent. But in the process, the place she's lived all her life is now part of Pakistan, where the Muslim majority doesn't want Hindu families like hers around. On the other side of the border, Muslims are faring just as badly at the hands of Hindus, and all along the way both groups, once peaceful neighbors, are feuding and trying to kill each other. As the family flees to safety, Nisha keeps thinking that the fact that her late mom was Muslim ought to make them friends to everybody, but instead it seems just as likely to get them killed.
","Twelve-year-old Nisha's journal of political turmoil and violence in 1940s India sheds light on a turbulent era. It also delivers a strong message of love, family, and kindness when things are at their worst. And despite the decades that have passed, The Night Diary's story, characters, and issues remain timely and compelling today.","Parents need to know that Veera Hiranandani's The Night Diary was named  2019 Newbery Honor Book.

It's loosely based on the experiences of author Hiranandani's family members in the 1940s. As 12-year-old narrator Nisha writes letters to her deceased mother in her diary, she describes the family's flight, hardships, dangers -- including murderous brawls and crazed knife-wielding men trying to kill children.

Who Says Women Can't Be Computer Programmers?: The Story of Ada Lovelace,Playful bio of female who pioneered programming in 1800s.,"WHO SAYS WOMEN CAN'T BE COMPUTER PROGRAMMERS?: THE STORY OF ADA LOVELACE tells the story of Ada Lovelace, born in England in the early 19th century, the daughter of Lord Byron. When Ada was an infant, her mother left Byron nd brought Ada to her family's country home. Ada, frequently sick, was tutored in math, and also loved drawing, writing, and music. She attended parties with important figures in math and the arts, where she met Charles Babbage, who'd invented an early calculator and was designing a machine that was the precursor to computers. Though the machine was never actually built, Ada expanded on his idea, devising a way to program the machine with punch cards, and envisioning a machine that could produce not only calculations, but also music and images, as computers do today.
","This delightful and engaging account of a 19th-century female math prodigy keeps readers amused and entertained while it inspires and expands girls' horizons. In Who Says Women Can't Be Computer Programmers?: The Story of Ada Lovelace, author Tanya Lee Stone uses snappy, inventive prose to convey the information. For instance, to tell us Ada was punished, Stone introduces Ada's cat, Madame Puff, who ""never, ever made her stand in a dark closet until she promised to behave,"" as Ada’s mother did. And when her father fled the country, she writes, ""owing enormous sums of money, Lord Byron leaped into a gilded coach he hadn't paid for."" An informational section at the end, entitled ""More to the Story,"" matches the story's breezy and conversational tone.
Marjorie Priceman's art is equally engaging. She fills the pages with fanciful detail as well as swirling numbers and equations. Her colorful ink-and-gouache paintings are full of fun detail that humanizes Ada. Young Ada's pictured with flyaway, corkscrew curls. While working at her desk, she rests her feet on her sleeping cat. And while maids outfit her in a ball gown, she stands on books and holds one to read.","Parents need to know that Who Says Women Can't Be Computer Programmers?: The Story of Ada Lovelace is by Tanya Lee Stone and Caldecott Honor-winning illustrator Marjorie Priceman, the same talented team who collaborated on Who Says Women Can't Be Doctors?: The Story of Elizabeth Blackwell. The subject of this bio, Ada Lovelace, is enjoying some deserved popularity, and a few good picture book bios of her have already been published. What this one has to recommend it is its infectious spirit of fun. Lovelace was born in England in the early 1800s, and her father was famed poet Lord Byron. Though women of her class were expected only to marry well, she was educated in math, introduced to influential figures, and distinguished herself as a visionary mathematician who pioneered computer programming. The book paints young Ada as a spirited and relatable girl, full of fun, and math as a creative adventure.

Letters from Father Christmas,Tolkien's magical North Pole tales delight all ages.,"In 1920, J.R.R. Tolkien's children began receiving handsomely illustrated letters from Father Christmas. The letters continued until 1943, when Tolkien's youngest child reached the end of her ""stocking days."" Father Christmas writes affectionate responses to the children's letters, and regales them with tales from the North Pole. Many feature the troublemaking North Polar Bear, who snaps the North Pole in half, accidentally sets off an entire storeroom of sparklers, and inadvertently overflows the tub and soaks the holiday packages. As world events darken Europe, trouble visits the North Pole in the form of goblins. Elves battle to keep the goblins out of Father Christmas' storerooms. Other characters include the Man in the Moon, Snowboys, and an elvish secretary.
","LETTERS FROM FATHER CHRISTMAS is a treat for readers of all ages. Young ones will savor hearing these stories read aloud, and teens and adults who delight in  J.R.R. Tolkien's imaginative work will enjoy seeing the North Pole through his unique lens. (There's even a goblin alphabet and a bit of elvish writing.) The letters are tender and warmhearted. And they're surprisingly funny, even when -- or especially when -- Polar Bear gets into mischief. Polar Bear often adds his own merry notes, disputing Father Christmas' version of events or embellishing a tale.
 The letters are reprinted as text, making them easy to read aloud. Many of the letters are reproduced, and elements of artwork further illustrate the tales. This is a book to treasure together, and may be particularly comforting for children nearing the end of their own ""stocking days."" It's just as magical for grownups, who will appreciate the creativity and witty humor.
 ","Parents need to know that Letters from Father Christmas is a clever collection of illustrated letters fantasist J.R.R. Tolkien, author of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, created for his children. They expand on traditional stories of St. Nicholas and the North Pole, adding the accident-prone ""helper"" the North Polar Bear, troublesome goblins, Snowboys, and others.

King Bidgood's in the Bathtub,Lively speed and luxurious artwork bewitch kids.,"King Bidgood is a merry old soul with an unruly beard, a flashing eye, and an unquenchable desire for his bath. Neither knight nor queen, duke nor courtier, can coax him out of the tub, so he invites them into it. Only the court page has the wits to beach the scrub-a-dub king in this playful, gleefully illustrated tale.
 ","In this Caldecott Honor book, the Woods have created not just a funny bathtub tale but also a guided tour of period costumes and courtly pastimes. The clothing is fantastic -- a carefully researched confection of frills and ruffs and jewelry -- and Don Wood sumptuously serves forth the mock battle, the luncheon, the fishing trip, and the ball, a crowning delight and profusion even in the cramped quarters of King Bidgood's bath.
Wood's oil paintings are rich and deep in subject matter -- complex narratives of their own -- and as the story progresses through the day, the light quality changes in each of the potent two-page spreads, with the watery illumination of morning shifting through shades of blue and red until the dark of night is cut by the light of the moon.

Pan's Labyrinth: The Labyrinth of the Faun,"Dark, magical adaptation matches the intensity of the movie.","PAN'S LABYRINTH: THE LABYRINTH OF THE FAUN is an enchanted work of magical realism by famed Mexican writer and director Guillermo del Toro set during the waning days of the Spanish resistance against the fascist dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Adapted into a novel for young readers and teens by best-selling fantasy author Cornelia Funke, the book tells the story of a young girl, Ofelia, who travels with her pregnant and recently widowed mother to an old mill that has been occupied by Franco's Falangist soldiers under the command of her new stepfather, Captain Vidal. On the night of her arrival, Ofelia encounters a magical fairy who leads her to an ancient maze behind the mill where she meets a magical faun who tells her that she is actually a princess and the heir to the throne of the underworld. To unlock her destiny and return to the underworld -- where she might be reunited with her dead father -- she must follow his instructions and complete three tasks. While Ofelia works on completing her magical mission, Captain Vidal and the Falangists battle with the guerrilla resistance fighters in the surrounding woods, who are secretly receiving assistance from the captain's servant, Mercedes, and his doctor, Ferreira. Ofelia retreats into the world of magic to escape the brutality of the war zone she's living in, but the horrors of Vidal's reign of terror are impossible to escape. The Wolf, as she calls Vidal, continues to torment both her and the rebels in his midst, leaving a trail of bodies behind him as he tries to snuff out the last hopes of the desperate opposition. Interspersed between the chapters of the main narrative, which tell the story shown in the film, re brand-new fairy tales that reveal the backstories behind many of the fantastical creatures in the book.
","Thrilling, enchanting, and heartbreaking, this well-achieved adaptation of a sensational film is an absolute page-turner. Cornelia Funke's writing is powerful and effective, preserving the mystery and wizardry of the original, while del Toro's handpicked illustrator, Allen Williams, adds striking visuals to accompany the text. As with any adaptation -- especially of such a stunning and imaginative film -- it's difficult to capture all of the creativity of the source material, but Funke does a nice job of re-creating the film almost shot-for-shot. And the new fairy tales re excellent additions that enrich the overall story and add something for fans of the movie who might wonder why they would want to read the book version. These allegorical vignettes not only give the reader a deeper understanding of del Toro's magical universe but lso provide welcome relief from the unrelenting darkness of Ofelia's tragic struggle. By the end of the book, it's hard to know what was real and what was fantasy, but perhaps the lesson is that true magic is conjured out of courage, selflessness, and hope even in the face of insurmountable odds and unimaginable evil. While Pan's Labyrinth is certainly darker and less fun than Harry Potter or even A Series of Unfortunate Events, fans of those series who don't mind a bit of tragedy and history mixed in with their magic will find plenty to love in this reworking of a modern classic.  ","Parents need to know that Pan's Labyrinth: The Labyrinth of the Faun, is a faithful adaptation written by children's fantasy author Cornelia Funke of Guillermo del Toro's classic film of the same name. The movie is often described as a work of magical realism, and the book as well is a dark, scary, and violent fairy tale set in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). It includes scenes of murder, firefights, and torture, though the book doesn't go into too much gory detail. Still, some main characters meet gruesome ends, several firefights leave dozens dead, and a wounded soldier gets his infected leg sawed off. Despite the bleak storyline and terrifying monsters -- both mythical and human -- this is a story of resilience and self-sacrifice in the face of cruelty and hopelessness. There are a couple of instances of cursing, including ""son of a bitch"" and ""a--holes.""

The 100: Book 1,Captivating tale about teens sent to recolonize Earth.,"THE 100: BOOK 1 is a dystopian sci-fi novel and the inspiration for the CW series of the same name. The story takes place 300 years after a nuclear war polluted all of Earth's sources, forcing surviving members of the human race to settle in space aboard a giant spacecraft. Due to the limited supply of natural resources such as oxygen, water, and food, the authoritarian government has implemented extreme measures, making all infractions capital crimes. This severe regulation applies only to adults, whereas minors can be retried at the age of 18. Apprehension that the spacecraft has only a few good years left, the Chancellor decides to send 100 juvenile delinquents on a mission to recolonize Earth. On this journey, the reader gets a close look at the four teens, whose lives are intertwined with love, hate, loyalty, and betrayal. 
","The 100: Book 1 is a captivating novel about four teens who set out to survive the most impossible of circumstances. Author Kass Morgan effortlessly weaves the four narrators' tales while cascading between the past and present. Flashbacks don’t always work in novels, but here, scenes flow naturally and keep the reader anxious to learn more about each individual’s personal story. Morgan examines issues that could arise if there were a cataclysmic decline in society while subtly shedding light on contemporary real-life political issues. Also, readers must consider the ethical dilemma of whether to punish another human being by depriving him or her of life. For sci-fi seekers, the only drawback is the hopelessly romantic one-liners topped with extra cheese, such as, “He tasted like joy and joy tasted better on Earth.”","Parents need to know that The 100: Book 1 closely follows four juvenile delinquents and their journey to recolonize Earth after only ever living in space. It's a futuristic dystopian novel that includes some violence. All crimes committed are punishable by death through lethal injection, and it's mentioned that countless people in the colony have already been executed. One character is shot with a gun, and another with a bow and arrow -- their fates are left unknown to the reader. A son finds his mother on the kitchen floor submerged in her own blood after she attempts to commit suicide. Teens engage in consensual sexual relationships, and there's passionate kissing. One of the main characters (a teen girl) becomes pregnant, which is a capital crime due to the strict population-control laws. There's an attempted rape.

Moxie,Empowering story of girls standing up to sexual harassment.,"Viv Carter creates the first issue of MOXIE, her feminist zine, because she's had it with boys who have no hesitation about demeaning, touching, verbally tormenting, or sexually harassing the girls in her small-town high school. She distributes the first issue anonymously, and no one suspects that always-follows-the-rules Viv could be behind it. At first, only a few girls show their solidarity by drawing stars and hearts on their hands, but as Viv secretly distributes more issues around the school, more girls join in. They wear bathrobes to school to protest an unfairly applied dress code and slap ""You're an A--hole"" stickers on the cars, lockers, and backpacks of boys who've harassed girls. In the midst of all this, Viv begins a first romance with Seth, who supports the Moxie Girl movement (but not always strongly enough for Viv). But the more empowered the girls become, the more school administrators become determined to stop them. When a girl comes forward to accuse the principal of refusing to listen when she told him she'd been raped by a football player, the Moxie Girls decide it's time to risk it all by staging a walkout.
","Inspiring and insightful, this feminist coming-of-age story has a strong message of can-do empowerment for readers who feel helpless in the face of sexual harassment. Moxie should open the door to serious and honest discussions between teens (both girls and boys) and their parents about what constitutes sexual harassment and what can be done if that culture exists in their school.
There's lso a discussion to be had about how far the actions of a movement like the Moxie Girls can go in real life. While identifying harassers with stickers or staging a walkout work well in the novel, they might not be the most productive actions in all situations.","Parents need to know that Jennifer Mathieu's novel Moxie is set in a small-town Texas high school that has long tolerated boys sexually harassing and even assaulting their female classmates. Then one junior girl, Viv Carter, decides it has to stop -- that the girls need to fight back. She anonymously publishes a call-to-action feminist zine titled Moxie nd secretly distributes it around the school. Viv's campaign starts small, with girls identifying themselves as Moxie Girls by drawing hearts and stars on their hands. As the school year progresses, the number of Moxie Girls grows, and by the novel's end, they find themselves in a showdown with school officials. Boys are allowed to ""bump and grab"" girls in the hallways and hold a contest to find the ""Most F--kable"" girl in the junior or senior class. Profanity is used fairly regularly: ""f--k,"" ""d--k,"" ""bulls--t,"" ""hell,"" and ""a--hole."" This book can lead to serious discussions between parents and teens about sexual harassment.

Tasty Baby Belly Buttons: A Japanese Folktale,Japanese tale is reinvented with humor.,"Little conquers big! Big monsters munch baby belly buttons, but a little girl defeats a gang of them and rescues a bunch of babies. Read-aloud audiences will love pointing at the amusing pictures and shouting that fun, bounce-off-your-lips phrase: ""Tasty baby belly buttons!""
 ","Meilo So's wild, swirling lines and unusual greens and oranges help create an otherworldly setting that matches the timeless folktale narrative. Picture-book audiences wiggle with mild fear when the author brings on the terrible oni. In well-timed passages, she eases the tension by highlighting tender moments between the old Japanese couple and Uriko.
The pages almost turn by themselves as Uriko marches off in her tall wooden sandals to find the monsters who have kidnapped the town's babies. The energy comes to a climax in the slapstick scene in which Uriko and her friends outmaneuver the fat-bellied oni. The only problematic aspect to this original telling of an old Japanese tale is in the foreign phrases that do not correspond to sounds English-speaking children understand. Some readers enjoy the unfamiliar phrases, but others are distracted by the sounds.","Parents need to know that the monsters that make off with a bunch of babies may worry some little ones. But humorous, repetitious language will have kids changing aloud.

The Promise of Amazing,Quiet girl tangles with bad boy in light teen romance.,"The first time Wren meets Grayson in THE PROMISE OF AMAZING, he's choking on a cocktail frank and she saves his life. An obvious attraction develops between them, but quiet, good girl Wren isn't sure what to think when she finds out Grayson was kicked out of his elite private school for selling term papers. Still, he continues to pursue her, even getting a job with her family's wedding-reception business. Wren likes him, too, but as she learns bigger, more dangerous secrets about his past, she has trouble deciding whether to trust him.
","Some characters -- such as Wren's movie-obsessed friend -- are overly scripted, and the plot seems to go on too long before reaching a too-perfect ending. The protagonists narrate alternate chapters, so readers get to follow Wren and Grayson's inner thoughts and feelings as their attraction turns to love. They'll also know that Grayson has a bigger secret sure to cause some trouble down the road. Still, although this isn't a deep book, teen-romance fans may find The Promise of Amazing a pleasant distraction with plenty of drama to keep readers wondering how things will work out between these two. Swoon-worthy moments include Grayson's realization: ""I'd never felt like this before...it was like everything else in the room had faded to black. Except her. And me. And that was too important not to fight for."" ","Parents need to know that The Promise of Amazing, a romance between a reforming bad boy and a quiet girl, has some swearing, a couple of fistfights, underage drinking, and an instance of drunk driving. Mild sexual content doesn't go into detail about anything beyond kissing and making out. Grayson's poor choices in the past, from selling term papers to hooking up with girls so his friends could rob them (and having sex with two of his victims), are part of the story, but so are his efforts to change. Ultimately there's a strong message about mistakes being part of life and learning to let people move on and do better.

Avatar: The Last Airbender: The Rise of Kyoshi,Servant girl becomes mystical hero in fast-paced fantasy.,"As AVATAR: THE LAST AIRBENDER: THE RISE OF KYOSHI opens, charming, young Yun seems to possess the traits of the Avatar, but unassuming servant girl Kyoshi displays real power. Forced into exile, Kyoshi hones her skills on the road with her friend Ragni. But an act of betrayal kindles an urge for vengeance. Can Kyoshi and her sometimes disreputable allies achieve justice and elevate her to her proper place of power?
","Sometimes a supporting character in a series has enough vibrancy to earn her own story, and this action-packed adventure spotlights a young character worthy of the sustained scrutiny. Kyoshi is serious in her quest for self-knowledge, but author F. C. Yee provides plenty of action, invention, and humor to animate her tale.
Readers unfamiliar with the Airbender universe may need some extra time to ramp up to speed in Avatar: The Last Airbender: The Rise of Kyoshi, but eventually the plot becomes easier to follow. Fans will find the new perspective on the protagonist refreshing and worth continuing in the saga's next volume.","Parents need to know that F. C. Yee's Avatar: The Last Airbender: The Rise of Kyoshi focuses on the backstory of a supporting character from the TV series Avatar: The Last Airbender. It chronicles the teen years of the longest-lived Avatar and her search for mastery over her powers. Kyoshi and her allies and enemies engage in semi-mystical martial arts, which are sometimes fatal, but not bloody. Sex and swearing aren't part of the mix.

Nick of Time,"Riotous, violent adventure with classic virtues.","Nick longs to be a hero, but sees little opportunity on his tiny island in the English Channel in 1939. But then, in quick succession, he discovers that his father is spying on the Nazis, a pirate is threatening him and his family -- and an ancestor from the past has sent him a time machine and needs his help to save Lord Nelson. Soon he is off to a sea battle in a previous century while his little sister helps a British commander to capture an experimental Nazi submarine.
","There's no doubt this genre mash-up will have boys, and even some girls, thoroughly engrossed right from the exciting opening. It's got pirates, spies, Nazi villains, swordfights, artillery -- and even time travel. This is the kind of book that can launch a million daydreams. And if it has a smattering of real historical characters and events, so much the better. Are the values espoused too anachronistic for modern times? Not for kids, to whom a black-and-white viewpoint is natural and appealing. Compared to such classic predecessors as Treasure Island, it may not be as well written, and the attempts at humor may sometimes fall flat, but it has one huge advantage for modern readers -- it moves. Like a galleon under full sail -- or a secret, super-powered Nazi submarine.","Parents need to know that there is quite a bit of violence here, some rather gruesome, especially a gratuitous scene where a man cuts off and swallows the tip of his own tongue to frighten a boy he is attempting to kill. The violence is set in a science fiction context, but it may be intense for kids unable to separate fantasy from reality. All in all though, this book celebrates classic values, like bravery and honor, and Nick is brave, stalwart, loyal, honest, true, and utterly dependable. Readers will pick up on a smattering of real historical characters and events, and the high adventure here may have a special appeal to reluctant readers, especially boys.

"Shadow Scale: Seraphina, Book 2","Quest for half-dragons grows in characters, complexity.","SHADOW SCALE picks up with Seraphina on a mission to locate the remaining dragon/human hybrids scattered across the land. Each has a unique look, interests, and powers, and some are reluctant to be identified. One in particular, Jannoula, has a twisted agenda of her own and uses her telepathic powers to take over the bodies and senses of her fellow half-dragons. A devastating civil war looms, unless Seraphina and her friends can find a way to break Jannoula's grip on them.
","Shadow Scale is a worthy successor to Seraphina, adding more to its mythology and introducing a new set of intriguing human-dragon hybrids. In particular, the introduction of a new villain, Jannoula, amps up the suspense. She proves to be a dangerous, clever, and formidable opponent. Seraphina's wish to protect and please everyone impedes the plot sometimes, but her empathy is an essential element of her personality and is part of what makes her such a compelling heroine. ","Parents need to know that Shadow Scale is a sequel to the acclaimed fantasy Seraphina, which won the 2013 William C. Morris Award for best debut book for teens. Its female protagonist is smart, resourceful, brave, and empathetic, and the novel promotes the value of learning to see more than one facet of a person. Strong language is infrequent (""bastard"" and ""arse""), and violence is depicted with restraint. Psychic attacks cause physical and mental anguish. A boy is stabbed in the wrist, an old man has his memories wiped, and various dragons are killed in aerial battles. None of these incidents is described with excessive detail. Dragons and humans are able to interbreed, but the details aren't discussed explicitly. Two young women share a kiss on the mouth, and Seraphina shares a passionate embrace or two with Prince Lucian.

Each boy must decide what kind of life he will live going forward, as the shock waves of a police beating shake them and everyone around them to the core.

It tells the story of two ALL AMERICAN BOYS whom readers will love and cry for as the teens are forced to grow up fast following the violent incident. The authors take readers on a journey with two fun, likable, and acutely emotionally aware teen boys as they navigate their own sense of morality even when the adults around them are often unable to or cannot give clear guidance.

In fact, life in the little community of Gingerbread Island, North Carolina, allows Cat Gladwell to receive some care and support that she'd long been missing. A family secret sets Cat on a path to figure out why her mother never talked about her childhood, or the loving people Cat's getting to know as her grandparents. ","Touching, eloquent, and rendered like a watercolor, this is a great summer read for tweens who like stories about family and travel. Caterpillar Summer makes the most of familiar summer-book elements -- last-minute change of summer plans, an older sister who uses her ingenuity to keep her younger brother special needs under control, grandparents with a mysterious past, ocean views and bike rides with the freckled girl down the street, neighborhood boy that the girls have to one-up because he's such a bully, and ice cream, early morning walks on the beach, new skills learned, and mysteries solved.
There are challenges, and the family mysteries are subtle and deep, but the characters know how to laugh, even if they feel scared or awkward. Though it doesn't avoid complicated situations, Caterpillar Summer allows for the grace that some adults possess to come through, which feels comforting in a big, busy, sometimes scary world.","Parents need to know that Caterpillar Summer is a lovingly rendered story of a 11-year-old Cat and Chicken, her 7-year-old bother with special needs, who are suddenly sent from their home in San Francisco to spend the summer on an island off North Carolina with their maternal grandparents, whom they've never met.

Circle,Circle faces fear of the dark and of the other in cute tale.,"CIRCLE suggests a hide-and-seek game near her waterfall nd tells her friends, Triangle and Square, that one rule is that you can't go behind the waterfall, because it's dark there. She closes her eyes and counts to 10, and when she opens them, Square is just standing there nd tells Circle that Triangle went behind the waterfall. Circle goes in to search for him and ends up in a big dark cave, where she finds Triangle but also sees another pair of eyes peeking out of the darkness. The two shape friends run away in fear, but once they're outside, Circle wonders, ""You know ... that shape in the dark might not have been bad. It might have been a good shape. We just could not see it."" ","This quirky friendship story uses minimalist art and relatable text to deliver a subtle message about our fear of the other. It may take repeated readings to zero in on what the author is getting at, but Circle works on many levels for kids. It's a story about facing fears, breaking rules, caring for and worrying about our friends. And it ponders why we assume someone we don't know or can't see is bad or threatening.
Jon Klassen's art is minimalist and intriguing, with the three cute shape characters in a mysterious earth-toned landscape, and several pages featuring just pairs of eyes popping out of a solid black background. It invites readers to fill in the bodies and actions that go with the pairs of eyes that are staring at -- and away from -- each other. Circle is offbeat, original, and fun. ","Parents need to know that Circle is the final volume of a funny shapes trilogy by the team of author Mac Barnett and illustrator Jon Klassen. Offbeat and inventive like the previous books, Square and Triangle, Circle brings all three friends together to play a hiding game in which Triangle goes behind a waterfall into a dark cave, and Circle must rescue him. The story deals with fear of danger and fear of the unknown -- including an unknown, unseen individual. There's also a subtle message about not assuming someone you don't know is bad and someone to fear.

The Heartbreakers,Fun Traveling Pants-style story with fewer mature themes.,"A circle of high school friends find themselves without boyfriends all at the same time. Alexia's parents are therapists, and she's the one who suggests writing a breakup code: a list of rules for the heartbroken to follow that will transform them into the heartbreakers instead. Focusing on themselves for a while instead of their boyfriends leads them to discover or rediscover things they love such as singing in a rock band, photography, and spending time with their girlfriends. But even so, the rules turn out to be too much, and in only a few short weeks there is much more dating going on than there was before, despite the pledge to not date anyone for three whole months.
","This is fun, predictable chick lit about four sophomore girls dealing with guys, parents' divorces, keggers, and the true meaning of friendship. Although the alternating narrator structure becomes a little dizzying with four points of view, the characters are equally drawn, with supportive parents and likable guy characters. Coming up with a code of rules to follow could be a useful tool for many situations. It's just too bad the focus goes right back to boys and dating in the end.","Parents need to know this is a pretty frothy romance somewhat similar to the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants series but with fewer mature topics -- just some teen drinking and a bit of swearing. The girls support each other and exhibit loyalty; most of the guys are positive, well-rounded characters, and the parents are mostly present and supportive of their girls. However, the idea that the girls are more interested in being great friends than having boyfriends isn't how it plays out.

I'm Dirty!,Great read-aloud for truck-crazed kids.,"A friendly backhoe loader takes readers to his dumpster job site for some messy cleaning up.
","This rollicking picture book packs a lot of action in the illustrations and the story. Any child who's fascinated by construction sites or big, yellow trucks will love the busy, buzzing monologue by an enthusiastic backhoe loader. Words and pictures mesh perfectly here. The grungy, rough background looks delightfully messy, and the bright orange-yellow of our friendly narrator pushes past his chunky outline, emphasizing his strength and zeal.
The text is informative (sharing the bits and pieces that make up a backhoe's tool chest), educational (a four-page spread counts backward as the truck cleans up old tires and broken lawn chairs), and entertaining. Kids who love mess and mud will like watching the backhoe become dirtier the more he helps clean. Bursting with energetic fonts that boom out in capitals and boldface, this book is fun to read aloud -- just be sure to keep it off the naptime book list.","Parents need to know that I'm Dirty!, which is narrated by a backhoe loader, is a great bet for kids who love trucks and construction.

She becomes obsessed with the topic and watches all the films she can about it. That inspires her to stage a protest, skipping school every Friday to sit outside the Parliament building with a sign saying, ""School strike for climate."" Soon she's joined by other students in Stockholm and other cities, who hear about her strike on the internet. In the end, students marched in protest in 43 other countries (listed in the back matter). She's invited to speak to the 2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poland and the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where she tells the assembled, ""I want you to act as if the house was on fire. Because it is."" ","This is an inspiring story of a Swedish teen standing up for what she believes in and becoming a world leader. Our House Is on Fire tells the story of how she became a global leader on the issue of climate change in mostly simple, brief text that kids will find relatable -- like how she felt invisible before she took up her cause and how it made her sad to see animals' habitats threatened by melting icecaps. Spare art helps makes the complex issues easy to grasp, too.
But some sophisticated vocabulary and some of the disastrous effects of climate change shown, including forest fires and floods, may be scary nd disturbing for young picture book readers. Some of the messages in quotes from Greta's speeches and on protest signs on the front and back cover may sound harsh to young ears, too.

She was named Time magazine's Person of the Year for 2019 (although that happened three months after the book was published, so it's not mentioned here).

Some of the dangers shown may be disturbing to young kids, such as a forest burning nd people stranded atop houses in a flood. Greta wants kids (and grown-ups and world leaders) to understand that this is an urgent problem that needs to be addressed immediately.

"Planet of the Pies: Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, Book 3","More absurdist fun with raining food, this time on Mars.","Grandpa, his nephew, Henry and his sister, Kate, the narrator, are watching TV when they see a news report about astronauts having landed on Mars, where they discover a thick, glutinous substance is falling from the skies. ""Here's a crazy thought: Could it be pie filling?"" the reporter asks rhetorically. The kids go off to bed, and Grandpa falls asleep in front of the TV, and has a brightly colored dream about being part of the team of Mars astronauts and dealing with the Martians' problem: pie raining down from the sky. Grandpa suggests they partner in a business venture to export the delicious pies to Earth.
","PLANET OF THE PIES will please fans of the series and kids who saw the movie based on the first and best of the series, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. And let's face it: Flying food is funny, and big-eared green aliens are funny. But the absurdist story is thin, and the twist at the end -- was Grandpa really on Mars? -- is a bit flimsy.

","Parents need to know that Judi Barrett's Planet of the Pies is the third picture book in the Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs series. Like Book 2, Pickles to Pittsburgh, it's not as impressive as the series starter, but it's still a kid pleaser, with absurd situations, likeable characters (including a diverse team of astronauts), a crazy plot, and fun drawings to pore over.

The Catcher in the Rye,One of the greatest novels of the 20th century.,"Holden Caulfield, about to be kicked out of yet another boarding school for flunking most of his courses, decides not to wait until the end of term and takes off for his hometown, Manhattan, a few days early. He figures he'll hole up in a cheap hotel, look up a few friends, then arrive home on time. But Holden is deeply troubled by the death of his beloved younger brother from leukemia, as well as a classmate's suicide. Alone in an uncaring city, his already fragile psyche begins to unravel.
","Holden Caulfield holds a place in the American psyche akin to Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer: an exquisitely rendered character with whom nearly anyone can identify. There are three true things that can be said about J.D. Salinger's masterpiece: It is one of the great works of American literature, it is one of the most frequently challenged by would-be book-banners, and, therefore, it is one of the most misunderstood books of the 20th century. It has been challenged and banned for all of the reasons mentioned above in the content advisories. But those who challenge it fail to see the forest for the little swearword trees. They have called Holden a cynical teenager, when in fact he's such a compassionate innocent abroad that he can hardly cope with the cynical world at all: He's so innocent and so alone that he tries to get a prostitute to just chat and keep him company (alas, no heart of gold here). Desperately lonely, adrift in what seems to him an uncaring world, he has been through some terrible experiences, and no one at all seems to have noticed that he's crumbling.
It's true that much of it is somewhat dated now. Yet there's a reason this book has stayed in print, is stocked in nearly every bookstore, and has been assigned in nearly every high school for the past 60-plus years: Its emotional power and poignancy are still as strong as ever, and Holden's inner self is just as recognizable to teens today as it has ever been. This is one of those books that everyone should read as a teen. At a time (1951) when ""teen"" and ""adolescent"" were barely concepts in the American mind, Salinger captured the adolescent voice and way of thinking more perfectly -- and more poignantly -- than just about anyone before or since.","Parents need to know that this book remains one of the best books about adolescence ever written. Any language used -- and it is chock full of mild to moderate swearing, and ""f--k"" is used several times -- is in the service of being true to the nature of a rebellious teen. There are also lots of sexual references, and everyone smokes and drinks -- including the underage protagonist. Holden refers to homosexuals as ""flits."" People have used these instances in an effort to have the book banned. But those who would do so miss the point of the book, which is a compassionate tale of a child adrift in the world. It's an American classic that everyone should read.

Change-Up: Mystery at the World Series,Mystery and ethics in sports journalism.,"Teen reporters Stevie and Susan Carol are covering the World Series when they meet the perfect story -- an aging minor-leaguer, widower, and single dad, called up to the majors just in time to pitch in the Series. But his story about how his wife died doesn't ring true, and since he is about to sign a deal for his life story, it seems worth investigating. With everyone involved telling lies, and whatever the truth is seeming destined to destroy a family, where does journalism end and privacy begin?
","This winning series does for bright kids who love to write what the Tom Swift series did for bright kids who love science. It provides a delightful fantasy of brilliant and talented kids operating with nearly complete freedom in the adult world and beating adults at their own game. Add in mystery, sports action, and in this case an ethical dilemma, and you get a winning formula that's fun and provokes both thought and daydreams.
Unlike others in this series, this isn't really about sports. There's a bit of sports action (which will be a bit hard to follow for anyone who doesn't know baseball pretty well), but it's mostly window dressing for a non-sports mystery with a strong ethical component. The story raises a host of interesting questions, some with a clear authorial opinion, some more ambiguous. How can we know the truth when everyone is lying? Is it ever a good thing to cover up the truth? What are the rights of famous people, journalists, and the reading public? Is fame worth the price?
 From the Book:
	He turned and saw a player standing at the locker. He had a bottle of champagne in his hands but clearly wasn't involved in the celebration. After seven games Stevie thought he knew all the Nationals players. But he was drawing a blank on both the face and the number, which was 56.
	Apparently, the player noticed the blank look on Stevie's face, because he  stuck his hand out and said, ""Norbert Doyle. You've never heard of me because I've never done anything.""","Parents need to know that there is some discussion of drinking, drunkenness, and rehab, and the story revolves around a possible drunk driving accident in which a mother is killed. There's also a bit of mild swearing.

"The Dream Thieves: The Raven Cycle, Book 2","Slow, lyrical prose builds to a thrilling, bloody sequel.","DREAM THIEVES follows the tremendous cliffhanger ending to The Raven Boys. The actions of Blue and her ""Raven Boys"" Ronan, Gansey, Adam, and Noah have awoken the supernatural leyline in rural Henrietta, Va., and no one is the same. Ronan, in particular, keeps having intense dreams and realizing that he can make more and more things from his dreams materialize in real life. Blue deals with her confusing feelings for best friends Gansey and Adam, and a mysterious, scholarly hit man pops up in Henrietta, posing a deadly threat to the entire clan.
","Maggie Stiefvater is not a zippy writer; her prose is lush and filled with detailed imagery and descriptive scenes. Combine her poetic writing style with the complicated plot line of a four-book series, and it's easy to imagine that some readers won't get past the first 50 pages. That's a shame for impatient readers, because once you're fully immersed in the story, it has a glorious, meticulously planned payoff that will simultaneously break your heart, give you hope, and make you demand the next installment.
Although Dream Thieves, as with all of Stiefvater's books, switches points of view among multiple characters, the main focus is the titular ""Dream Thief,"" Ronan Lynch,  troubled soul who can't get over the death of his father. Adam continues to struggle with a mountainous ""trailer trash"" chip on his shoulder (he's a genius but has no money, no family, and too much pride), but, like all of the Raven Boys, there's more to him, and you ache for him to find love. Blue and Gansey's friendship teeters dangerously on the verge of something more. And Mr. Gray is the most perfectly named, morally ambiguous new character to the already crowded story. Keep reading, because however big the fireworks are in Dream Thieves, it's clear this series is only going to keep getting better and better.","Parents need to know that Dream Thieves is the second book in award-winning young adult author Maggie Stiefvater's best-selling series, The Raven Cycle. There's even more violence in this installment than in its predecessor, The Raven Boys, as well as more references to lust and romance (adults date, kiss, and eventually make love, but it's not described, and the female protagonist deals with an unintended love triangle). The violence is quite bloody, and the language is as strong as in the original (""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""a--hole""). There's some underage drinking, and a secondary character deals and uses drugs. The story explores issues about family relationships, the unconditional nature of friendship, sexual orientation, and class.

"Girl Code: Gaming, Going Viral, and Getting It Done",Inspiring true story of teen coders' video game success.,"In GIRL CODE, shy Sophie from New York's Upper West Side and Andy, from a conservative Filipino family in the Bronx, meet at a summer coding program. While Sophie has never coded, Andy is already a coder and a lover of video games. It's an intensive seven weeks that takes the girls in the program from learning simple coding language to fun projects such as building slot machines (one with an Elvis theme). Andy and Sophie team up for a final project and decide to take on a most unexpected theme -- menstruation. Why, the girls ask themselves, is blood acceptable to talk about in the context of guns and violence but a shameful secret when it comes to a girl's period? They create a retro-themed video game called Tampon Run, in which participants shoot tampons not guns at their enemies. The game goes viral, and Sophie and Andy soon find themselves giving interviews to media around the world and being invited to major tech events. Happily, none of this attention goes to their heads, and the girls use what they're seeing and learning to help them make solid choices about their college majors and what will come after.
","Both aspiring coders and teens with non-tech dreams will be inspired by the smart, engaging, and funny story behind the creation of a most unlikely video game. As the story is told in alternating chapters by Andy and Sophie, readers can see how each of them grow not only as coders but as young women trying to forge their own identities. Sophie goes from not being able to speak up in class to giving speeches in front of large audiences -- nd being really good at it. Andy goes from fearing what her parents will think of her decisions to embracing a future that's right for her. For girls interested in a career in technology, Girl Code offers a realistic (but still encouraging) look at the challenges they could face in a field that's still male-dominated.","Parents need to know that Girl Code is the true story of New York City high school students Andrea ""Andy"" Gonzales and Sophie Houser, who find themselves paired up at a summer program that uses coding as a way to empower girls. Andy and Sophie decide their final project for the program will take on one of the world's most pervasive taboos: menstruation. The video game they create, Tampon Run, will go viral almost immediately, altering forever how they see themselves and their futures. Andy and Sophie do go into great detail about their coding projects, but everything is presented in such an upbeat, accessible, and friendly way that even the most tech-challenged reader won't be intimidated. While coding is a central theme in the book, the story is just as much about two enormously likable and relatable 16-year-old girls finding their own voices, speaking out, and learning firsthand how to create change.

I Am Gandhi: Ordinary People Change the World,"Engaging picture bio of Indian hero, nonviolence pioneer.","In I AM GANDHI, the title character takes readers from his boyhood in India, where he first started to notice people treating one another unkindly and unjustly, to England, where his career as a lawyer flops after he faints in court, nd to South Africa, where he rallies his fellow Indians to fight the discrimination they face -- without violence. When he returns to India, he faces even bigger challenges, as the country's British rulers treat the locals terribly (and the locals aren't always that nice to one another, either).
","Indian civil rights leader and nonviolence pioneer Mohandas Gandhi comes to life in this cartoon history bio of a man whose life and example still inspire people and influence events worldwide. Young readers and listeners may find some historic events very alien to their own experience, such as India's historic discrimination against ""untouchables"" and the British oppressing Indians by forcing them to buy salt from their overlords. But the larger issues of helping others, transforming yourself, and never resorting to violence shine through. Stealing the show is the cartoon kid who keeps cheerleading about ""Truth Force!"" and its superpowers. While much of I Am Gandhi will go over the heads of the pre-reading audience, it's a good introduction to an important historical figure, and it rewards repeat visits over time.","Parents need to know that I Am Gandhi (part of the Ordinary People Change the World picture book series by Brad Meltzer and Christopher Eliopoulos) is a lively introduction to the life, times, and nonviolent principles of India's revered national hero, Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi.

Century-old events in a land far away  -- and how to right wrongs without resorting to violence -- resonate with issues and problems of today's world. As little cartoon-figure Gandhi makes his way through moments of struggle and moments of inspiration, kids learn a lot about what seemed to need changing in Gandhi's world and how, despite being small, weak, shy, and discriminated against, he changed the course of history and made many people's lives better.

Scary Stories for Young Foxes,"Intense, violent horror adventure is riveting and haunting.","In SCARY STORIES FOR YOUNG FOXES, fox kits Mia and Uly are separated from their litters and find themselves thrown into a dangerous world full of terrifying unknowns as they try to make their way home. Far from their dens, they have to navigate dense forests, open fields, river monsters, and homicidal humans, and other scary monsters that lurk in the dirt and snow. Beyond the environmental treachery, they have to face their own inner demons, the nagging self-doubt and emotional pain inflicted by their own families who might not even want them alive. The book is a collection of short stories told campfire-style to a dwindling number of fox kits, with each story blending into the next.
","Heavy, violent, and thought-provoking, this is the rare horror story that's also heartwarming. Scary Stories for Young Foxes takes readers on a terrifying ride, masterfully combining the feelings of inadequacy and fear that come from being rejected by family with the optimism and courage of young hearts. Uly's father's domination helps readers consider the complicated choices surrounding family violence, and his siblings' bullying because of his disability will hit sensitive readers hard.
Each story is complex and riveting, and while author Christian McKay Heidicker takes some time to get through the first few stories, the pace picks up midway. He weaves the tales together seamlessly, somehow bringing heart and depth to these harsh, terrifying adventures.","Parents need to know that Christian McKay Heidicker's Scary Stories for Young Foxes, illlustrated by Junyi Wu, is a 2020 Newbery Honor Book. It's a gorgeously written, no-holds-barred set of intertwining horror stories centering on Uly and Mia, two young foxes separated from their litters and in constant fear of death. The book is layered and complex, combining themes of domestic violence, bullying because of a disability, shame, fear, and pain with the deep love between a mother and her kits, and the growing loyalty between friends. None of the violence or pain is gratuitous, though: The hunts, the methods of survival, the dominance of some and shunning of others are all accurate, and the violence is similar to that of realistic nature shows. This book is not an easy read academically or emotionally, but it's intensely rewarding and thought provoking.

Two Truths and a Lie,More of the same in Book 3 of mean-girl murder mystery.,"In TWO TRUTHS AND A LIE, Emma is still masquerading as her long-lost identical twin, Sutton, living the popular rich girl's life as she tries to solve her murder. Meanwhile, Sutton's ghost secretly tags along, filling in her own memories as they begin to emerge. In this third installment, Emma's main focus in on Thayer, Sutton's secret lover, who has been missing for months but snuck into her room at the end of the second volume, Never Have I Ever. Sutton's memories confirm that they were together the night she died, but why does Thayer now have a limp? And what does he mean when he tells Emma, ""I'm the only who knows who you really are""? Emma tries to sort out the clues while still fooling Sutton's clique of frenemies and thwarting the prank they're planning against her own new secret boyfriend, emo Ethan, the only one who knows who she truly is.
","Mostly, this is more of the same: more intrigue, more label-dropping, more pranks and complicated relationships. Readers may find Two Truths and a Lie a bit light on pranks -- and may be disturbed by the theory that Sutton drove a ""passionate"" Thayer to murder -- an idea that parents may want to explore with their kids. The author does include enough mystery to keep the pages turning and creates some intriguing tension between Emma and Sutton (Sutton at times resents Emma for being nice to her friends, while Emma decides in this book to ""behave in a way she could be proud of, even of her actions weren't one hundred percent Sutton-like"").
In the end, Two Truths and a Lie is mostly more fluffy fun for series fans who will no doubt be eager to get going on the next installment.","Parents need to know that Two Truths and a Lie is the third book in the series that began with The Lying Game, which follows a rich, popular mean girl who was murdered -- and her nice, long-lost twin sister, who impersonates her as she tries to solve the crime.

A Prayer for Owen Meany,"Affecting, darkly comic novel has heavy, mature themes.","John Wheelwright and Owen Meany are best friends growing up in smalltown New Hampshire. As a Wheelwright, John was born into the town's elite, with all the entitlements that come with a prestigious name and notable ancestors. Owen's the only son of distant, financially strapped parents in the granite quarry business. But despite his diminutive size and ""wrecked"" voice, Owen's magnetism, brilliance, and self-assurance make him stand out as something truly special. As John and Owen move through life together, facing death and tragedy, controversy and spirituality, Owen has a deep impact on everyone he meets. And as he grapples with his faith while challenging the conventions of church, school, and country, his fate becomes clear -- and he refuses to turn his back on it.
"," A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY is a dense and darkly comedic novel that has heavy themes and explores serious issues. But it's also incredibly affecting and relatable. The characters are brilliantly crafted and the dialogue is so rich that it's easy to get swept into the story and feel every plot twist and downturn along the way. Irving's ability to lace heavy subject matter -- like war, religion, and tragedy -- into the tribulations of endearing and flawed characters makes for truly a distinctive story.
A Prayer for Owen Meany is an emotional investment, but it's satisfying from start-to-finish. It's ludicrous and heartbreaking, hilarious and horrifying -- and ultimately unforgettable.
 ","Parents need to know that A Prayer for Owen Meany, American novelist John Irving's seventh novel, is about two childhood friends whose lives intersect with class, war, family, and faith. There are lots of mature themes in this darkly comedic read, particularly about politics, war, and religion, and there is some candid sex talk. There's drinking and smoking, sometimes to excess, destruction of property, causalities of war, and class issues. Though it's dense and challenging at times, A Prayer for Owen Meany is also a deeply affecting story with unforgettable characters and thought-provoking themes.

As his son, Bob, tells the story, Mrs. Dowdel takes some getting used to. But in a series of vignettes both comic and moving, they find that this cantankerous and eccentric old woman enriches their lives and those of many others in the town.
","Richard Peck has had one of the longest and most successful careers in children's literature and, reading this, it's easy to see why. He just gets better and better. A SEASON OF GIFTS shows clearly that there's really no one else with Peck's remarkable combination of gifts. He has the gift of Twain, a humorist whose comedy is both intelligent and moving.

In George stories, all's always well that ends well.
","Not all Curious George stories are created equal, and the six installments included in this anthology are more formulaic than the original George books. However, young children often enjoy predictability, so that's not necessarily a problem for the books' intended audience.

There, a mysterious encounter draws her to five other students. And that's when Ash's real adventure begins: Together, the group discovers they're able to do unbelievable things like control the weather or others' minds. In fact, they may not even be human.
","Readers may find strong Ash a refreshing protagonist: She's not a shy wallflower waiting for a cute boy to help her blossom. Ash knows she's hot stuff, whether she's beating an opponent on the tennis court or flirting with a guy on the dance floor. But she's not sure who -- or what -- she really is for most of the book, and that makes her appealing -- at least when the pace picks midway through the book.  Unfortunately, other characters aren't so well-drawn: Scary big sister Eve is one-dimensional as the unabashed ""bad girl,"" and the author doesn't develop Ash's friends enough to care too much when they're put in harm's way.

 ","Parents need to know that this coming-of-age fantasy features teens with paranormal abilities. Teens should be prepared for some violence: The body count begins in the earliest chapters, and later in the story, protagonist Ash witnesses several deaths, including those of people very close to her. There is also some decidedly PG-13 language, and adolescent lust, romance, and even a high-school pregnancy. Even so, readers might find a role model in refreshing Ash: she's brassy, smart, self-confident -- and loyal.

"Black Heart: Curse Workers, Book 3",Entertaining but predictable final installment.,"Seventeen-year-old Cassel Sharpe comes from a family of curse workers (people capable of magic who have the ability to con anyone with just one touch of their hand). Curse workers can make others lose their memories, fall in love, die, or, in Cassel's case, transform into any other object. The federal government offers Cassel a bargain for immunity from all of his past crimes if he agrees to work for them (the \""good\"" guys). The offer seems pretty good, considering that Cassel's corrupt brothers had conned him into murdering people, then erased all memory of his criminal offenses. While Cassel is torn between protecting his family and the girl he loves, he learns that sometimes working for the \""good\"" guys is no different from working for the \""bad\"" ones.
","BLACK HEART, the final installment in the CURSE WORKERS trilogy, doesn't offer much surpise or suspense, unlike the first two books, which left readers hanging on every word. The major characters, initially complex and impulsive, are a little dull and predictable in the finale. True, they've grown into more confident, self-aware young adults than they were in their younger years, but they lack the enjoyable witty banter and playful language that originally pulled readers in.
But Black Heart is an entertaining book nonetheless, and fans will enjoy its small details: descriptions of mob mansions, fancy clothes, and extravagant cars. Fans will also be happy with the ending and appeased by the one small shocker that Black has in store.","Parents need to know that Black Heart is less violent than its predecessors in the Curse Workers trilogy, White Cat and Red Glove. Two people in this final installment get shot; one dies. A shooting scene includes gory details, but readers are told ahead of time that the injury isn't serious. Violence, when it happens, is reactionary or accidental rather than premeditated, making the small scuffles easier to stomach than in the prior installments. Teen boys drink alcohol and get drunk, then have a terrible hangover. A teen couple has sex.

Hannah: Daughters of the Sea,Rather innocent gothic romance with a fantastic twist.,"When Hannah leaves the orphanage at the age of 15, her first placement via the Orphan Train to Kansas is a disaster. A physical deterioration strikes that necessitates her return to New England where she becomes a scullery maid. A mysterious and tantalizing portrait painter, an obsession with the sea, and a magical transformation help Hannah become her true self.
","This metaphoric coming-of-age tale reels the reader in with a likeable heroine who is smart, hardworking, self-reliant, self-aware, and yet innocent and naïve. A new twist on fantasy by an adept author provides readers a great introduction to gothic romance. Is the eldest daughter of the household truly mad, or simply spoiled and manipulative? Who is the mysterious young painter who compels in Hannah forbidden desires? These mysteries and the requisite foreboding carry the reader along swimmingly.","Parents need to know that there is no bodice ripping in this gothic fantasy. The most you'll find is an unsettling attraction two girls have for a young painter and some passionate kisses. There is also much discussion of the eldest daughter’s madness and the acknowledgement that it might impact her marriage prospects.

The Upper Class,"Good friendship tale, but sex, drugs, labels, too.","Laine is from old-money Connecticut. Loud Nikki wears gold jewelry, glittery eye shadow, and swears like a sailor. The girls -- roommates at an expensive boarding school -- don't immediately bond; in fact Laine doesn't even tell Nikki that she's being targeted by the school's alpha girl, who wants her to drop out. But their troubled pasts and struggles to find themselves eventually bring them together.
","You've heard the story before: Two opposites form an unlikely friendship at a posh boarding school; what makes this story unique is that its characters seem very vivid -- and vulnerable. They both have deep family issues, and encounter new problems as well: Nikki falls for a bad boy, who gets expelled, and Laine's eating disorder threatens her field hockey scholarship -- and future college career.
Their prep school setting feels equally real. The authors went to boarding school together, and it's clear that they loved it, warts and all. Don't be fooled by the book's cheap packaging or its formulaic set-up. Readers will be truly moved by both girls' stories -- and appreciate their growing friendship.","Parents need to know that younger teen girls who are into all of the ""popular girl"" series books will want to read this, but it will slap them with all the same raw, adult themes that make these books guilty pleasures. Teens drink a lot, smoke -- and even snort cocaine. One protagonist loses her virginity in the school library; another has an eating disorder. There is swearing, lots of label name-dropping -- and even some pretty disturbing hazing.

The Hero's Guide to Being an Outlaw,"Sweet, silly, swashbuckling end to fairy-tale saga.","Our heroes Princes Gustav (""Angry Man""), Duncan (""Pipsqueak""), Frederic (""Tassels"") and Liam (""Capey"") and heroines (Rapunzel, Snow White, Cinderella and Princess Lila) have scarcely caught their breath after the events of Book 2 when--surprise!--more peril looms. Liam may have escaped an unwanted marriage with Briar Rose (aka Sleeping Beauty), but now he and his friends are the prime suspects in her murder. And as if it's not bad enough to be pursued through 13 kingdoms by bounty hunters, our heroes soon discover that all those kingdoms have been taken over by mind-controlling sinister forces. Encounters with monsters, pirates, dungeon-keepers, witches, giants, beasts of prey, and heavily armed soldiers ensue. Will the League of Princes and the Ferocious Female Freedom Fighters survive? Will they live happily ever after? Will it be worth the trouble?
","THE HERO'S GUIDE TO BEING AN OUTLAW careens through 500-plus thoroughly engaging pages of madcap, slapstick perils and wisecracks. By that time, Christopher Healy's three-volume saga has jumped not only the shark but the giant mongoose, the brain-melting beetle, and the shape-shifting snake. Don't expect things to make a whole lot of sense; do expect many charming moments as various characters fall in love, display courage when it counts, and save the day in reliably oddball fashion.
Aside from the mostly cartoonish violence, there's little problematical content and much entertainment value. The story's an excellent read-aloud choice, but adult readers-aloud are warned that author Healy tosses off the occasional cultural in-joke that will go right by little ones and have grown-ups in giggles, as when a character named Val Jeanval joins the entourage. Some allusions only Baby Boomer grandparents might recognize, like when ditzy Duncan calls a sea monster ""Cecil.""","Parents need to know that Christopher Healy's​ The Hero's Guide to Being an Outlaw is the final installment of the Hero's Guide trilogy. It brings the tale of the four Princes Charming to a satisfying close, with upbeat messages on loyalty, friendship, kindness, developing a spine, and the strange way someone's peculiar qualities turn out to be just what's needed to save the day. As you might expect after reading first two books, The Hero's Guide to Saving the Kingdom and The Hero's Guide to Storming the Castle, the hefty (528 pages) finale is a nonstop barrage of cartoonish mayhem, inspired silliness, dramatic reversals, and romantic comedy. Assorted villains are bent on killing the four Princes Charming and their (usually far more competent) female counterparts, and some characters (human and otherwise) come to violent ends. But it's hard to take the cartoonish hack-and-slash too seriously, especially since Rapunzel's tears heal the wounded and many of the dead have trouble staying that way. Note: Author Healy reviews video games for Common Sense Media.

Whittington,"Clever retelling of a legend, from the cat's POV.","Three stories merge together here. The first is about Whittington, a scruffy tomcat, descended from Dick Whittington's legendary cat, who wants to become part of the community in a barn full of animal outcasts kept by the kindly Bernie and his grandchildren, Ben and Abby.

\
\
The second is his retelling to the other barn animals and Ben and Abby, of the story of his famous ancestor, Dick Whittington's cat. The story of Dick and his cat, based in reality but told in legends dating back to the early 1600s and recounted in several modern books listed in the Endnote, is a rags-to-riches tale of a poor boy led to fame and fortune by an unusual pet with a knack for killing rats.

\
\
The third is about dyslexic Ben's efforts to learn to read before he is held back and placed in Special Ed.
The last two parallel, to a certain extent, as Dick struggles to make his way in the world and Ben struggles with his frustration and fear. Dick is helped by his cat, who steers him to both fortune and love, while Ben is helped by all the barn animals, who convince his sister to set up lessons in the barn, and convince him to try out the Reading Recovery program at school, despite the teasing of his classmates.
","Relationships between human and animal, and between language and story, unite the threads of this rich and deceptively complex novel spanning across six centuries. Kids will enjoy the three interlocking stories here, especially the one that takes place in the 14th century. The retelling of Dick Whittington's legend -- about a boy who finds fame and fortune due to his cat's knack for killing rats -- is thrilling -- and told from a feline point of view. Kids will also be fascinated by the well-researched period details, and it may send some scurrying for more information, especially about Marco Polo.
This gutsy young boy, filled with grit and determination, hearkens back to an earlier era's heroes, such as the boy in Where the Red Fern Grows.. The barnyard scenes will also remind many of Charlotte's Web in their peaceful community of speaking animals (and kids who can join and understand them), as well as in their uneasy, but ultimately mutually beneficial, relationship with the rats.","Parents need to know that a young boy is wounded in the face in a knife fight, and a chicken is killed by rats. One character smokes cigars, children in the Middle Ages drink beer, and opium and hashish are mentioned as trade goods.

I'll Give You the Sun,Brother-sister twins trace their rift in riveting novel.,"Noah and Jude were inseparable twins in eighth grade, but three years later they're barely civil to each other. A tragedy has torn them apart. Both are budding artists, encouraged by their mother, who wants them both to go to the prestigious California School of the Arts. Only Jude is accepted, but she has trouble expressing herself artistically -- a problem she attributes to supernatural forces. Noah meets Brian, the new boy next door, and the attraction is intense and instant, but self-conscious Noah isn't sure if the feeling is truly reciprocated. Struggling with her art, Jude seeks guidance from  famed sculptor, whose James Dean-ish protégé, Oscar, can't keep his eyes or camera off her. But there are complications and family secrets that keep the twins from pursuing love or their friendship with each other. Through it all the ghost of a dead grandmother constantly visits Jude with advice. The twins' stories interweave as the drama unfolds and they go back and forth from age 13 to 16.
","I'LL GIVE YOU THE SUN is a compelling novel of twin siblings' fractured lives. There's heartbreak, wisdom, and joy -- and the writing often sings. Jude and Noah's passages of reflection are written in a stream-of-consciousness style that lets readers feel as if they know and understand them. Author Jandy Nelson is particularly drawn to characters with misfit, superstitious families, and fans of her debut novel, The Sky Is Everywhere, will be awestruck once again at her ability to capture the transformative power of grief, loss, and art (music for Lenny in Sky and the visual arts for Noah and Jude in Sun). The author so vividly describes the artistic process that readers will feel the sand and stone in their hands as Jude sculpts or the charcoal as Noah sketches. Their art is what binds them but what also tears them apart.
As with Lenny and Joe in her first book, Nelson spends a good bit of the book tracing Noah and Jude's experiences with first love. Both of them have messy but rapturous love stories with guys who aren't perfect but might be exactly what the twins need -- if their own insecurities don't get in the way. Nelson's books aren't easy, lazy reads. They demand your attention with their lyrical writing and shifts in time. Some young readers may even be confused at times, as the sequences jump between the past and the present. Yet Jude and Noah are so alive, you really care about what happens to them. ","Parents need to know that I'll Give You the Sun by Jandy Nelson (The Sky Is Everywhere) is a brilliant, emotional, complex novel told in two voices, and it won the 2015 Michael L. Printz Award for excellence in literature written for young adults. In alternating chapters, often in a stream-of-consciousness style, we hear the voice of rtistic Noah at 13 and that of his daredevil twin sister, Jude, at 16. The novel includes three love stories, awakening sexuality, devotion to art, a tragic death, betrayal, remorse, and forgiveness. There's some swearing and name calling (including ""f--k,"" ""holy s--t,"" and ""homos""), teen drinking, bullying, and a rape. The two narratives collide in artful, touching, and revelatory ways.

Hachiko: The True Story of a Loyal Dog,"Hachiko waits for his master, even after he dies.","Kentaro goes to the train station to meet his father, and there gets to know Hachiko, Dr. Ueno's loyal dog. Hachiko walks Dr. Ueno to the station every day, and every day he's waiting there when Dr. Ueno returns in the evening.
But one night Dr. Ueno doesn't return -- he has died at work. Hachiko returns every night to wait for him, even after he is taken miles away. Kentaro, his family, and others bring him food and water. This goes on for years, until finally Hachiko himself dies. And at the spot where he waited so faithfully, the townspeople erect a statue in his memory.
","Like a Japanese haiku, this book is as notable for what's missing as for what's present. Based on a true story, it is spare, elegant, without any cloying Western sentimentality -- no tugging at the heartstrings, no anthropomorphizing, no dramatic death scenes, just a matter-of-fact telling of an affecting true story through the eyes of a fictional boy.
Though the story is universal, the author and illustrator adroitly drop in details of Japanese life: ""Ladies in kimonos walked carefully, trying to keep their white tabi socks away from the grime of the streets."" The author also includes a ""Story About the Story.""","Parents need to know that Hachiko's devoted friendship and loyalty will appeal to young children.

Rump: The True Story of Rumpelstiltskin,Fractured fairy tale will charm and delight young readers.,"Twelve-year-old Rump learns he has the magic ability to spin straw into gold. But the magic has its own harsh set of rules that can't be broken and create terrible consequences for Rump and those around him -- and attracts the attention of the greedy town miller and the gold-obsessed king. Rump sets out from home to help the miller's daughter, whom everyone believes is the one doing the spinning. The trouble culminates in Rump's being locked into a bargain for something he doesn't even want: the queen's firstborn child. In order to escape this destiny, Rump flees the castle to find the truth about his past. Along the way he meets trolls and witches who help him discover who he really is, how he can solve the problems he created, and how he can control his abilities and his future.
","Liesl Shurtliff's debut novel, Rump, has plenty of charm, whimsy, and humor to entertain and delight young readers. Children familiar with the ""Rumpelstiltskin"" fairy tale will appreciate some of the details more than those who aren't, but you don;t have to know the old story to enjoy this one. It stands well on its own, presenting an unusual but relatable hero in a fun fantasy world. The story is well paced, and although the writing doesn't dazzle, it deftly holds the reader's interest and keeps us rooting for the fun and funny new hero.","Parents need to know that Rump flips the famous ""Rumpelstiltskin"" fairy tale.  The familiar good guys, like the miller, are downright bad, or behave badly out of desperation, like the miller's daughter-turned-queen. Rumpelstiltskin, as the 12-year-old hero Rump instead of an old man, becomes a truly sympathetic character. The occasional violence is mostly playful hitting, but blood is mentioned twice. Scary witches are mentioned, while the witches we meet are mysterious but good. Scary trolls also make an appearance but turn out to be harmless, helpful creatures who keep themselves safe from humans by hiding behind their horrible reputations. Rump's grandmother dies in bed early in the story.

Gemini,Engaging story of conjoined twins dealing with teen drama.,"GEMINI tells the story of conjoined twins Clara and Hailey, who are struggling to figure out how to enjoy typical teen rites of passage and how to follow their separate goals into adulthood. After they were born in Los Angeles, their parents moved them to Bear Pass, a tiny California mountain town. The idea was to keep them out of the public eye and in a community where everyone would know and accept them. This works until the girls want more out of life than their small town can offer. Even though the girls are literally joined at the hip, they are very different. Clara has a quiet, subdued personality and loves astronomy; Hailey is vibrant and outgoing and wants to become an artist. The story follows them as they meet boys, pursue their different interests, and compromise endlessly with each other and their parents over every aspect of their lives. All the typical teen dramas and concerns are amplified because of their condition. The story shows that while being a conjoined twin is a challenge, it also offers a unique relationship others find difficult to understand.
","In this cute coming-of-age story, conjoined twins Clara and Hailey struggle with some normal and not-so-normal teen issues. The teen years are about separating from your parents and becoming your own person, and Gemini examines what that means for twins who are physically joined together. Author Sonya Mukherjee delves into the emotional connection between Hailey and Clara, and they mature over the course of the story from being self-focused to wanting what's best for each other. The girls are presented as having contrasting personalities: Clara dulls herself, feeling that they stand out enough as it is, while Hailey sports bright pink hair and a tattoo. Even though the story is told through alternating points of view, the twins' voices aren't distinct enough on the page, and it is sometimes hard to tell whose chapter is whose.
The format is formulaic, with the girls struggling with dating, feeling like outsiders, and not knowing what they want to do after high school, but the added complication of being conjoined twins heightens the emotional and logistical aspects of these teen issues. This proves especially true when dealing with their parents. It is hard not to sympathize with the worry and fear that consumes their mom, even if she goes overboard in protecting them. Clara and Hailey are engaging, smart characters and fun to hang out with over the course the book. The other characters are one-dimensional. One storyline that at first seemed to be a major plot point gets dropped completely about three-quarters of the way through. Aside from these minor issues, the book is a sweet, uplifting read.","Parents need to know that Gemini is a coming-of-age story about conjoined twins Clara and Hailey, who are navigating the ups and downs of their teen years. Issues such as dating and figuring out life after high school are hard enough on most teens, but the girls have the added complication of being joined at the hip -- literally. One can't make a decision that doesn't affect the other. The book hits on common teen topics: dating, friendships, disagreements with parents, and schoolwork. Clara and Hailey challenge each other on important matters, such as getting out in the world where they get treated like freaks versus never leaving their small town or taking a chance with dating, knowing they'll never have ""normal"" relationships. The content is tame, in that the romance aspect isn't explicit, there's no violence, swearing is infrequent, and the characters don't drink, smoke, or do drugs.

The Yggyssey,Sequel to The Neddiad offers more goofy humor.,"Iggy (short for Yggdrasil) Birnbaum lives in a run-down hotel in mid-20th century Hollywood. When she notices that the ghosts who normally inhabit her hotel are disappearing, she discovers that they are all heading for a big party in an alternate plane of existence. So she and her friends Neddy and Seamus follow the ghost of a rabbit and end up in an alternative Old New Hackensack where things are ... peculiar.
","Like its predecessor, The Neddiad, whether or not your kids will like this depends entirely on their particular senses of humor. Unlike humorous fantasies from, say, Douglas Adams or Terry Pratchett, the story won't carry readers through this if they don't get the jokes: there isn't much plot, and what there is doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Author Daniel Pinkwater isn't interested in any character development either -- Iggy and her friends are more or less just oddball blanks to whom odd things happen.
	So then, the humor, upon which enjoyment of this hangs. It's not broad, or potty, or slapstick, or humiliation humor -- it's gentle humor, of the polite sort, the jokes of a kind grandfather with a twinkle in his eye. Some of it is wordplay, some arch references, and a lot of the author amusing himself and if you want to go along, fine, he's not bothered either way. From the Book below has a sample, and if your kids find it funny, then they'll probably like this book. If not, you might want to look for something with a little more story and character -- just in case they don't get the jokes.
 From the Book:
	""We're going with you,"" Neddie Wentworthstein said.
	""To the hootenanny in not-in-New-Jersey Old New Hackensack?"" I asked.
	""Yes, the hootenanny, or hauntenanny, or walpurgisenanny, or whatever it is. If you're going, we want to go too,"" Seamus Finn said.
	We were sitting on the secret closet stairs to nowhere, drinking Dr. Pedwee's cream soda and sharing a bag of Gypsy Boots's whole-grain cuchifritos.","Parents need to know that there is little to be concerned with here: a few brands mentioned and a reference to rolling cigarettes.

"Angelfall: Penryn & the End of Days, Book 1","An intense, sometimes horrific, end-of-the-world adventure.","Six weeks after angels have descended upon Earth and destroyed most of civilization, 17-year-old Penryn struggles to protect her mentally ill mother and her wheelchair-bound sister. She witnesses a battle between two angels, only to see the victor fly away with her sister, leaving behind the loser, Raffe, shorn of his wings. Penryn and Raffe form an uneasy alliance as they make their way to San Francisco to confront the new angelic regime.
","ANGELFALL serves up a fresh take on the Apocalypse, using angels as the instruments of humanity's destruction. Seventeen-year-old Penryn is an engaging and resourceful narrator-protagonist, and the relationship that develops between her and the injured angel Raffe has a refreshingly sarcastic undertone. Much of the story's big picture, however, remains obscured, with little hint about what the angels are actually up to, and that withholding of key information undercuts some of the plot's urgency. Some of the revelations at the book's climax, however, are likely to discomfort some of the novel's more sensitive readers.","Parents need to know that Angelfall is a gripping and intense supernatural post-apocalyptic adventure. There's a fair amount of violence (angels battle each other) and horrific elements (hordes of tiny demons devour humans and scorpion-like angels sting and suck the life force from their human victims), which may be too disturbing for some younger or more sensitive readers. Although the main characters are obviously attracted to each other, the sexual content is low, as is the level of profanity.

Jake and Lily,"Twins with deep bond grow apart in funny, thoughtful story.","In Newbery Award-winner Jerry Spinelli's JAKE AND LILY, the title characters are twins with a mystical bond: Every year on their birthday, they sleepwalk and wake up in the middle of the night at the train station without knowing how they got there; they can never play hide and seek because each can sense where the other is; without being told, they know when something is wrong with the other. But the summer they turn 11, all that changes. Jake wants to hang out with his friends, but Lily still wants to hang out with Jake. Jake doesn't see what the big deal is; Lily can't understand how Jake can abandon their close relationship so easily. In alternating chapters -- and occasionally alternating sentences -- each twin narrates the events of the summer that lead them to realize nothing can ever stay the same, and that's OK.
","Jake and Lily have strong, distinct personalities that come across clearly on the page, and the story of their magical twin bond will intrigue many readers. Although Lily's fixation on why her relationship with her brother can't stay the same grows somewhat tiresome, it's realistic and all the more gratifying when she finally sees a way out of her doldrums. Jake's narration tends to be the more lighthearted and fun, with a thoughtful undertone that he seems unaware of. Though the story starts out short on action, it picks up toward the end, and the alternating narration and often short chapters make it a quick, entertaining read.","Parents need to know that Jake and Lily presents a realistic view of twins struggling to establish their own individual identities. Jake's friends pretend to befriend a boy so that they can make fun of him behind his back, and later Jake's friend takes the bullying to the next level by destroying the boy's property.

Now 17, she and Curzon, 19, are near the end of their long walk south to find Isabel's little sister Ruth, who was taken away from Isabel five years ago. Isabel doesn't exactly find what she expects nd decides to return home to Rhode Island where she hopes to buy her own farm and live in freedom. The journey back north finds them right in the middle of the 1781 seige of Yorktown by the Colonial army. Curzon remains loyal to the Revolutionary cause, determined that people fighting for freedom are a better bet than the promises of freedom the British army offers. Isabel doesn't think either side cares about people who look like her nd would rather leave the whole mess alone. Can their friendship endure if they choose different sides? What good can come from planting the ""seeds of America"" when you don't know what will grow?
","Laurie Halse Anderson's riveting trilogy comes to a gripping conclusion that's as hopeful and frightening as the end of the Revolutionary War must have been to those who lived through it. Isabel returns to narrate the last installment of Ashes: The Seeds of America Trilogy, and she's admirable and relatable as a young woman struggling to find her place in strange, new circumstances where nothing is guaranteed and nothing can be taken for granted -- not even bonds of family, love, and friendship.
Tweens nd middle schoolers will relate to messages about knowing how and when to choose a side, or when to follow your own path, and about how to open yourself up to the risks that come with loving someone. The plot keeps the pages turning, and the story is richly embroidered with fascinating details about both everyday life and the larger events of the Revolutionary War as it comes to an end. There's also plenty of food for thought about slavery's effect on the very beginnings of our nations, and kids can be encouraged to think about how those beginnings continue to reverberate today.","Parents need to know that Ashes is the final book in Laurie Halse Anderson's Seeds of America trilogy about the American Revolution. Violence is mostly from military action. Blood, injuries, and the horrors of war are occasionally mentioned but aren't gory or described in detail. Characters are in peril, either from battle or being returned to slavery. There's one kiss, and feelings of attraction and affection are mentioned. There's a lot of educational value, especially in lesser-known aspects of the Revolutionary War such as women's roles alongside armies and government policies and promises about freedom for former slaves who served in the war. Isabel and Curzon struggle with choosing sides and maintaining their friendship when they disagree about what to do. Overall the messages are wary but hopeful about a better future for a brand-new country nd for Isabel and Curzon to be able to live in freedom and without fear.

The blow left him with temporal lobe epilepsy, which made him even more of an outsider. After he takes the blame for some destruction on a neighbor's property, Alex develops a friendship with Mr. Peterson, a rather secretive and stubborn older man, and winds up making a promise that he will do almost anything to keep.
","The Universe Versus Alex Woods is a funny and affecting coming-of-age novel, addressing weighty issues with humor, sensitivity, and insight. Alex is a prickly but ultimately very likeable protagonist, with a unique outlook on life. The novel pays homage to iconoclastic science fiction/literary writer Kurt Vonnegut, but British author Gavin Extence doesn't push the influence too hard. All in all, The Universe Versus Alex Woods is a winner for older teens.","Parents need to know that The Universe Versus Alex Woods is a funny, moving, and well-executed coming-of-age story set in England that addresses some potentially disturbing issues, including marijuana use and assisted suicide. In keeping his promise to dying American Vietnam vet Mr. Peterson, 17-year-old British protagonist Alex breaks a number of laws, but throughout the book he exhibits a commendable commitment to doing what's right, rather than what's merely allowed. While the sexual content is extremely low, the use of objectionable language is fairly high, though usually not by the young protagonist (he does call someone a ""c--t"" and is promptly punished for it). Supporting characters are fairly free with their swearing, with ample instances of ""f--k"" and lesser expletives like ""damn,"" ""hell,"" ""piss"" and ""bastard.""

Mouse and Mole: Fine Feathered Friends,Warm friendship tale may inspire kids to go out and explore.,"On a blustery spring day, Mouse and Mole want to go bird watching and make bird books, but the birds are too easily frightened away. The frustrated friends come up with a plan to camouflage themselves, covering their clothes in fake feathers and building a nest of their own. They're finally able to get an up-close look so they can draw in their sketchpads. Back home, they blend their talents for drawing and writing to create a bird book together.
","Parents and children alike will enjoy going on an adventure with these two winsome friends. Wong Herbert Yee’s little heroes -- this is their fourth book -- cover a lot of ground: scientific observation, brainstorming, teamwork, and more. Each chapter offers something meaty for kids to chew on: bird behavior and songs, how nests are built, crafting a disguise, and collaborating on a book. Along the way, kids get a strong lesson on friendship and problem-solving.
The lengthy text, divided into four chapters and gently paced, may test the patience of some young kids. Simple sentences and a softly repetitive structure, along with the amusing story, help pull new readers along. With a strong emphasis on sequential action, this could serve as something of a playbook for kids who want to plan an adventure of their own.
Soft hues of green, brown, and orange ground ample illustrations that enrich and move along the text.","Parents need to know that the friends in this warm tale model great friendship skills, working together to solve problems and create a keepsake together.

"A Study in Charlotte: Charlotte Holmes, Book 1","Drugs, rape, murder in tense, edgy Holmes-Watson update.","As far as 16-year-old Jamie Watson is concerned, the only good thing about being shipped off to a posh boarding school in Connecticut is that he'll finally meet Charlotte Holmes, who's also there. Relations between their families have been dicey since Sherlock and Dr. Watson's lifetimes, but Jamie has always been thrilled by her crime-solving exploits and secretly dreamed of being her sidekick on wild adventures. The reality turns out to be quite a bit more complicated: Charlotte is brilliant, beautiful, bitter, and druggy, and Jamie is soon under her spell. When her recent rapist turns up murdered in a scene straight out of ""The Adventure of the Speckled Band,"" she and Jamie realize that someone's trying to frame them -- or worse. But who, and why?
","The latest page-turning entry in the Holmes-and-Watson spin-off genre finds their present-day teen descendants trying to stay alive and out of jail as an unknown murderer stalks their boarding school. A STUDY IN CHARLOTTE (playing on the title of the first Sherlock Holmes tale) offers an edgy, complicated, snarky title character in 16-year-old Charlotte Holmes; a relatable, engaging narrator and friend in Jamie Watson; and a boarding school setting full of hearty-partying rich kids and mysterious killers. There's also a bit of James Bond-style international intrigue, as it soon becomes clear that powerful hidden forces lurk just out of sight. Some of the darker elements (drugs, rape, murder, and people's lives being ruined) demand a mature reader, but the odd, compelling friendship of the two teens and the frequent plot twists keep things interesting.","Parents need to know that A Study in Charlotte, the first installment in a planned trilogy, features the 16-year-old descendants of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in a lurid boarding-school mystery set in Connecticut, with plenty of drugs, alcohol, gambling, and violence, including rape and murder. Brilliant, troubled Charlotte Holmes has been solving high-profile mysteries since childhood -- and dabbling in hard drugs just as long. Reluctant rugby star Jamie Watson struggles to be a good friend and keep her out of trouble but has issues of his own, from a rage problem to an estranged father. Typically for dark-side-of-boarding-school tales, there's plenty of drinking, drugging, and crude language, including ""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""ass,"" and ""wanker,"" as Charlotte and Jamie try to find the killer who's trying to frame them -- or actually kill them.

The Ashleys #1: There's a New Name in School,Standard clique book with same mean-girl behavior.,"There is a reigning clique in Miss Gamble's Preparatory School for Girls. The Ashleys are perfect at being perfect. The right clothes, hair, friends, the right name: Ashley. When Lauren gets an extreme makeover in time for 7th grade she decides that the Ashleys' reign should come to an end.
","While full of name brands and catty behavior, this book isn't as cruel and risqué as other clique books -- and thankfully, this light diversion is also a fast-paced read. Popular author Melissa de la Cruz makes her characters easy to relate to and root for, despite their cattiness. Readers will want Lauren Page to overcome her awkward past, but most likely will cringe when she starts to imitate the bad behavior of the Ashleys, like ditching her old ""uncool"" friends.
Pretty girls say and do mean things, and parental figures are usually nowhere to be found, so there's plenty to talk about with tweens/teens for parents who allow some guilty-pleasure reading now and then. At least the sexual content is dialed down a few notches here. Now that the Gossip Girl books are also a TV show, you'd almost call this book refreshing. Almost.","Parents need to know that it's all about the $2000 purses and $900 sweaters here. When they aren't shopping, the characters are scheming to get to the top of the social ladder or scheming to stay there. Parents are either absent, turning a blind eye, or trying to buy acceptance like their middle schoolers. The book is not as mean or racy as others in this genre, but it's far from sweet.

Paperboy,"Award-winning coming-of-age book teaches empathy, bravery.","When he agrees to take over his friend's job as a PAPERBOY for a month in segregated Memphis, Tenn., the narrator knows it's going to be a challenge because he has a severe stutter, which makes it difficult to communicate -- so much so that, when one customer asks him to say his name, he's so stressed he faints. But thanks to the paper route, he suddenly finds himself involved in adult issues and dealing with new situations and people, including a well-read, philosophical Merchant Marine, who challenges him to think more deeply about life; a beautiful alcoholic who's very unhappy; and the town's scary junkman, who taunts him. He also discovers long-buried secrets about his own family and the nanny he loves. Through his summer experience -- including a night of violence -- he learns about a bigger world and starts to have more perspective on his own struggles, in the process learning to appreciate the support he really has.
","Paperboy is challenging but important. Readers will appreciate the narrator's struggles -- not only his speech problem but his growing understanding of the adult world's complexities and failings, from widely accepted racism to his family's painful secrets.
Author Vince Vawter based Paperboy on his own experiences. Readers may grow exasperated with his detailed explanations of stuttering, but he makes it clear how much the impediment affects the stutterer's life. The book's menacing atmosphere starts with the opening, ""I'm typing about the stabbing for a good reason. I can't talk,"" and the violence is intense for a middle-grade novel. But readers mature enough to handle the material will come away with a deeper understanding of what life was like in the segregated South -- and what it means to truly come of age.","Parents need to know that Newbery Honor Book Paperboy, set in the segregated South, involves situations and attitudes typical of that era and calls for some maturity on the reader's part. A friend of the narrator's mother complains about a plan to integrate the schools, and his African-American nanny has to sit in the back of the bus unless she's with him. The story includes violence and questionable behavior: The narrator notices a woman on his route has a black eye and overhears an awful fight she has with her husband; he also breaks into a man's house and knocks him down when the man comes home. His nanny is severely beaten. A character fantasizes about throwing a rock at a bully nd later does throw a bottle at a man who's strangling a woman. A woman reveals that her brother was murdered over a bag of sugar. Learning that his father's not named on his birth certificate, a boy wonders about his mystery parent.

"Rogue Knight: Five Kingdoms, Book 2",Slow storytelling in an intriguing fantasy realm.,"After defeating Carnag in Book 1, Cole, Princess Mira, Jace, Joe, and Twitch don't stop to celebrate. The High King, Mira's tyrannical father, still has Mira's sisters locked up and hidden around the five kingdoms, and they need to be found before their stolen magical powers form into something even scarier than Carnag. Mira sets her sights on finding her sister Honor first. Their first step: Get magically disguised in special gossip houses called Confidence Lounges to find out where to start looking. After some sleuthing, they learn she may be in the neighboring kingdom of Elloweer. Cole also finds out his friend Dalton may be enslaved in Elloweer and working as a slave in one of their most secretive Confidence Lounges. He's determined to save him while helping Mira find her sister. It's a good plan, but on the ride to Elloweer their caravan is overtaken by the infamous Rogue Knight and his men, who recognize Mira and kidnap her. Suddenly there are three rescue missions underway. Will Cole find Mira, Dalton, and Honor before a destructive magical power overtakes Elloweer?
","ROGUE KNIGHT suffers from many of the same issues as series opener Sky Raiders: The storytelling is just too slow. Cole and Mira spend too much time in the Confidence Lounges getting disguised and casually taking in gossip, and there's too much backstory on the Rogue Knight and all his duels and the whole system of duels in the kingdom. What Rogue Knight does well is what author Brandon Mull always excels in: world building. And, in this series, he's tasked with creating a new form of magic and a new way of life for each of the five kingdoms. The magic of seemings is pretty cool, and so are the crazy hermit grand shapers and their abilities. Mull also adds a bit more whimsy to his world this time; the scene with slime for dessert is pretty great. The series' strengths will definitely be enough to keep fans reading.","Parents need to know that Rogue Knight is the second book in the Five Kingdom series from fantasy author Brandon Mull, who developed a big fan base from his Fablehaven and Beyonders series. If kids have already read some of Mull's books, they'll find this series less violent and just a little less complex than Beyonders. There's still an average amount of fantasy violence with characters injured and killed by arrows, swords, battle axes, a flail, and evil magic. There are a couple of sad deaths, a knights' duel to the death, and some kidnappings, and Cole nearly loses his hand to vengeful slavers. Cole remains a valiant main character who chooses loyalty to his friends over his own personal safety.

Chu's First Day of School,Sneezy panda conquers fitting-in fears in reassuring tale.,"Chu, the young panda who starred in Chu's Day, is worried about what will happen on his first day of school and whether his classmates will be nice and whether they'll like him. ""They will be nice,"" his mother reassures him. ""Of course they will like you."" When he gets there, things are going well until the teacher asks the students to write their names on the board and ""say one thing you love to do."" Jengo the giraffe likes to get things down from high places, Pablo the monkey loves to climb up things, and so on. Chu gives his name, but the chalk dust makes him sneeze so hard he blows the roof off the building and turns the class furniture upside down, which makes the kids smile. ""That's what I do,"" he says. Then he comes home and tells his parents, ""They like me. They were nice. I'm not worried anymore.""
","Readers who enjoyed Chu and his explosive sneeze in Chu's Day will be happy for another Chu adventure. But there's no need to have read the first book to be tickled by CHU'S FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL. The humor and pacing are great, and Adam Rex's illustrations are wonderfully expressive, capturing Chu's worries, sadness, and joy and the pride of other animals, from hippo to snake, as they happily show off what they do. This is a fine book to help kids going into kindergarten, changing schools, or headed for any transition about which they're feeling social anxiety.","Parents need to know that Neil Gaiman's Chu's First Day of School, illustrated by Adam Rex, follows the team's Chu's Day, which introduced the adorable young panda with the uncontrollable, titanic sneezes. Here, Chu's worried about whether the kids at school will be nice and if they'll like him. With humor and a bit of well-paced suspense, Chu wins them over with his explosive special talent.

The Straight Road to Kylie,Racy gay-themed read is fun but contrived.,"Jonathan knows he's gay, but he agrees to pose as the boyfriend of a popular rich girl when she bribes him with a chance to see his favorite pop star in concert: Kylie Minogue. But after fighting with friends -- and falling for a cute boy -- he begins to wonder if he made the right choice.
","The premise is fun but farfetched: A popular girl bribes a gay boy to be her boyfriend, hoping to maintain her social status ""by dating the newest, hottest guy on the market."" Readers willing to accept it will get drawn into energetic Jonathan's often wacky suburban life. Outrageous characters breathe life into this story -- like his bisexual best friend Carrie, who introduces herself by slapping his booty and shouting, ""Oh, baby is this seat taken?!"" Readers will have some good laughs along the way (at a Halloween party, for example, he dresses in a Madonna combat costume, but tells his fake girlfriend that he is dressed as an Italian GI Joe).
Be warned: There is lots of mature material -- drinking, swearing, sex -- and the plot follows a predictable path. In the end, Jonathan learns that he can't just play it straight -- he also needs to meet other gay guys, including a first boyfriend.","Parents need to know that this book features a gay protagonist who ultimately meets his first boyfriend. Along the way, he has sex with a girl, makes out with a bartender, and dares two girls to kiss.

Almost Alice,Next chapter in popular series deals with teen pregnancy.,"Alice is having trouble figuring out who she is. Just when she thinks she has a good grasp, something happens that makes her question herself. A friend's pregnancy, a rekindled romance, changing friendships, changes at home -- all of these events keep Alice feeling sort of like herself, but not quite. People tell her to get used to it, but Alice wonders how life became so complicated.
","ALMOST ALICE is a great addition to Phyllis Naylor's Alice series. Picking up in the second semester of 11th grade, Alice wonders who she is outside of being the best of best friends. Naylor captures the confusing time in teens' lives when it feels as if everything around them is changing -- including the way they see themselves. She also adds a healthy amount of humor. When a teen girl's house catches fire, concern quickly turns into hilarious embarrassment as firefighters discover the cause of the fire: her much-loved, secondhand, rubber push-up bra.
 Naylor also takes a serious turn of events -- an unplanned pregnancy -- with real emotion: disbelief, horror, despair, panic, and realistic adult intervention. With so many books about teen sex and pregnancy these days, it's a welcome dose of realism. The novel moves at a great pace that will keep readers turning pages, but things end far too neatly and in a very after-school-special way.","Parents need to know that this installment of the long-running series includes a plot point about Alice's friend who is both sexually active and pregnant. Her pregnancy is handled with real emotion: disbelief, horror, despair, panic, and realistic adult intervention. Other than that, there are some light making out/kissing scenes. Another girl discovers the wonders of a push-up bra.

Off-Color,Mixed-race teen thoughtfully dissects race issues.,"Two important things happen to Cameron on the brink of her 16th birthday: First, after her mother loses her jobs, they are forced to move to projects in Brooklyn. Then, while unpacking, Cameron discovers that the father she has never known is actually African American.
Living in new surroundings -- and with a new identity -- Cameron feels very confused. But her spirit (and supportive friends, including new friends from the projects) help her learn to be more open-minded about race -- both when dealing with other people, and herself.
","The plot may not always be in focus, but the vibrant dialogue and characters make this a quick and engaging read. Readers will find it easy to root for spirited Cameron, who is not a typical teen book heroine: She is doing poorly in school, skips classes, and talks back to teachers (though she is still loving with her friends, and, mostly, her mom). In the end, though, readers will be most impressed with the frank and honest conversations about race. Early in the book, Cameron tells her friend it's easier for a white girl to date a white guy; later, after she learns she is half African-American, another friend argues that ""real black people aren't gonna think you're black, so why try to be something you're not?""
Classroom discussions about Othello and Malcolm X -- as well as references throughout to mixed-race celebrities like Halle Berry and Mariah Carey -- solidify that this book is just as much about getting teens to think and talk about race as it is a coming-of-age story about a Brooklyn girl learning to accept herself. But, really, that's enough to make it a worthwhile read.","Parents need to know that this book centers on a girl who discovers she is half African-American. There is some frank talk about race throughout as Cameron learns to accept her new identity. Other than that, this book is pretty tame, though Cameron does skip school, texts her friends in class, and ends up talking to the principal a lot. When Cameron moves to the projects, she and her mother are afraid of violence -- but there isn't much in the book beyond girls threatening to beat up Cameron and her friends at the mall. Also, Cameron is approached by a creepy man at the beach who is later arrested for ""endangering the welfare"" of two girls.

At the book's end, readers are invited to imagine their own oddities, even though Numeroff can't stop hurling her ideas about.
","Joe Mathieu's illustrations have a gusto and humor all their own. It is clear that Laura Numeroff could have written ""dogbone"" -- and her verse sometimes approximates that term in originality -- and he would have drawn a cunning and witty scene to accompany it. This volume is a sequel to Numeroff and Mathieu's Dogs Don't Wear Sneakers, and Numeroff evidently didn't feel the need to give this book a new ending. Which is a shame, because it is such a loser.
""Now just close your eyes and draw with your mind. / You might be surprised at what you will find ... .""

"And Then What Happened, Paul Revere?",Adventure and humor mix with history.,"Listen my children, and you shall hear of the midnight ride of Paul Revere--and a lot more! A silversmith at fifteen, he became a furniture maker, a dentist, a portrait engraver, and, of course, a legendary Revolutionary War messenger. Jean Fritz tells his story well, although background information on the purpose and significance of his rides is lacking.
 ","Jean Fritz's book makes a great read-aloud text, especially for the classroom. She is at her best when she includes little-known facts that make children and adults chuckle, and kids will ask many questions about America's early history. Margot Tomes' illustrations add humor to the story but are not particularly vibrant. They succeed, however, in enhancing the mood Fritz establishes in her text.
Fritz sometimes assumes readers know more than they probably do. For instance, Fritz describes Revere's mission to Hartford, New York City, and Philadelphia without fully clarifying the purpose: She says simply that he is spreading news. Children may not come away understanding his travels or where the British were and what they did in America. Tomes does, however, include a map illustrating Revere's southward ride.","Parents need to know that this book avoids heavy-handed lecturing.

Courting Darkness,Absorbing historical fiction ramps up the palace intrigue.,"COURTING DARKNESS begins when Mortain, the physical embodiment of the god of Death, falls in battle and is gone from this world. Two of his daughters, Sybella nd Genevieve, are left to wonder what will become of the convent dedicated to him where they were raised, and more important, which, if any, of the powers he imbued them with they'll still have now that he's gone. The marriage of the duchess of Brittany to the king of France is a perfect opportunity for Sybella nd Genevieve to influence the ruling regime and ensure that Brittany remains under the duchess's control, and also to make sure that their convent survives the growing influence of the Catholic Church. As events bring them closer together, they'll have to navigate intrigue and mystery, to say nothing of just surviving to see another day.
","Fans of Robin LaFevers' His Fair Assassin trilogy will enjoy this immersive return to Brittany in the 1400s as they follow familiar characters and meet new ones. Courting Darkness still has fights and battles -- and assassinations, of course -- but it also ramps up the palace intrigue. A marriage of political convenience brings the war between Brittany and France to an end, and teens will easily relate to narrators Sybella nd Genevieve as they figure out how to stay true to their beliefs, their missions, and their sisterhood while learning who they are and what they're capable of.
If you haven't read the previous trilogy, it may take a little longer to immerse yourself in this world, and it may take some extra time to get to know the characters and some of their previous relationships. But fans of historical fiction that skews a little to the dark side without sacrificing adventure, romance, and strong female characters will find the journey well worthwhile. Nongraphic but mature sexual content and violence make it best for teens and up.","Parents need to know that Courting Darkness is the first in a planned two-volume historical fiction novel with fantasy elements. It's set in the same medieval French world as author Robin LaFevers' popular His Fair Assassin trilogy nd shares some characters with that series. The main characters are trained assassins, so violence from fights and battles use swords, knives, and crossbows. Hand-to-hand fighting includes punching, kicking, choking, and snapping necks. Blood is mentioned as spurting, splattered, etc., without much other detail. A couple of instances of having sex describe kissing and mention caressing breasts and nipples, thrusting, shouting, and grimacing. Other sexual content includes briefly described kisses, mention that in the past, two women practiced having sex with each other, men who have mistresses living in their houses with their wives, confirming virginity after consummating marriage, and sexuality as a tool for spying or trading with men for something you want. Drinking wine is mentioned pretty frequently, sometimes to excess and usually with consequences described. Strong language is rare and includes ""merde"" (French for ""s--t"") and ""damned."" Themes explored include how women were repressed, how pre-Christian religion was repressed and changed to Catholicism, and the power of love. The main characters are good role models for loyalty, bravery, and compassion.

She feels she's ready to be a grownup and has the cell phone, briefcase, and high heels to prove it. After Summer takes her new consulting business a little too far on the playground, her parents hatch a plan to help her rediscover the joys of childhood -- by switching places with her! Will Summer begin to enjoy being a kid again, or is the responsibility of adulthood really what she wants?
","This is a really cute and funny book -- from the humorous interactions between characters to the adorable and lively illustrations. It's short enough for young readers not to be overwhelmed, and the story and pictures are engaging enough to keep them entertained. It's also a great book for parents to read during story time.
Summer's infectious personality and spunk makes it easy to fall in love with her, and the way she portrays being a grownup is hilarious. It reminds parents that their kids are always watching and absorbing the best (or worst) of their behavior. The book has an easy pace and also shows the less serious side of parenting as Summer's mom and dad get creative in bringing out their inner kid.","Parents need to know that Summer Jackson: Grown Up is about a little girl who thinks she's ready for adulthood, as she perceives it. There is nothing inappropriate in this lively picture book featuring a spunky main character and her loving, understanding parents, who trade places with Summer to show her what being an adult is really like.

Taken in by the humans who live in an underground city, at first they only want to find a way back home. But then Gregor learns that his father, who disappeared years before, is in the Underland too, held prisoner by the rats, who are about to launch a war on the humans.
The humans are allied with the bats, and the spiders and roaches are in the middle. But an ancient prophecy talks about the coming of a warrior from the Overland to unite them to defeat the rats, and the Underlanders think that Gregor is the warrior of the prophecy.
","In this first part of a planned five-part series, first-time children's novelist Collins gets it just right.

Kirsten and Walk are winning protagonists (and Kirsten's voice is snappy-funny), the short alternating chapters keep readers wanting more, and, just when you think you know where it's all going, there's a big coincidence that adds a fascinating level of complexity. For a book with so little action, it's awfully hard to put down.
Alternating chapters focus on Kirsten (told in first person) and Walk (told in the third person), but somehow it all works.","Parents need to know that If a Tree Falls at Lunch Period, by Newbery Honor-winning author Gennifer Choldenko (Al Capone Does My Shirts) is the story of a girl who's starting seventh grade at an upscale private school and having trouble fitting in.

Lionboy,Brilliant premise -- so-so execution.,"In a slightly future world where pollution and asthma are rampant and cars are banned, Charlie's scientist parents are kidnapped. Pursued by their thuggish kidnapper, Rafi, and unwittingly carrying the formula for which they were taken, Charlie sets out to rescue them. Though his chances seem remote, he has one thing working in his favor: he can talk with cats, and cats all over the world, who know more about his parents than he does, are motivated to help him out.
He hooks up with a floating circus headed to France, where the cats say his parents have been taken, and meets a family of lions longing for escape. While working as the liontamer's helper he plots a way to arrange the lions' return to Africa while following his parents, who are now headed to Venice. But Rafi is closing in.
","It's a brilliant premise that should have worked. You have  boy who can talk to cats (and lions!), a floating circus and later the Orient Express for settings, a child out to rescue both lions and his parents, a touch of fantasy, and an adventure spanning the width of Europe. It does eventually start to work, but only bout three-quarters of the way through.
The whole thing has the pacing of a fly in honey -- lots of buzzing, but not getting much of anywhere. It might have worked if Charlie had some personality or voice or humor, but he's pretty much a cipher -- Our Hero Who Speaks to Cats. Those children who make it to the end will be rewarded by a very exciting last section and a cliffhanger ending, and will want the sequel immediately. But many kids won't get that far.","Parents need to know that this book hints at issues including corrupt drug companies and governments, animal treatment and captivity, and the environment. There also is a very positive portrayal of several interracial families.

The Red Book,Wildly original wordless book deconstructs magic of reading.,"A young girl finds a red book on the way to school. Inside, it holds a map with an island, and ever-closer pictures lead to a new friend. Suddenly, she's looking at a picture of a new friend looking at a picture of her. Before she knows it, she's off on an adventure traveling through space and time to make new friends and leaving behind the joy of reading.
","With stunning images and turns that surprise and delight, THE RED BOOK is not easily forgotten. Young readers enter a book that ultimately deconstructs the magic of books. It's a visual-only journey aided by vivid, simple pictures in watercolors, gouache, and ink. But altogether, it gets the brain of kids and adults alike firing on all cylinders, reminding readers of the wonder and awe books offer by simply showing us another world. Kids will marvel at the magic of the storytelling: How is she seeing him and he seeing her at the same time? Where is she going? What happens to the book now? Parents will find the clever yet simple approach refreshing and impressive and likely a source of very engaging conversation.","Parents need to know that The Red Book is an unconventional, image-only book-within-a-book that takes readers on a journey inside a book where they are engaged, transported, lost, and found. It's suitable for any age, though it's ideal for preschoolers and beginning readers who will marvel at the simplicity, structure, and imagination. Expect delight, awe, wonderment, and many questions about how it works.

Heart of Darkness,Tense journey to find ivory trader gone rogue in Congo.,"Charles Marlow, an experienced British seaman, takes a casual trip down the Thames River in London and recounts for his fellow passengers an earlier journey he made to the Congo, charged by his employer, a Belgian trading company, to collect ivory as well as a European ivory trader named Kurtz, who has gone rogue. As Marlow slowly travels up river on a steamer toward Kurtz's remote outpost, he sees increasing evidence of the Europeans' brutal treatment of the local African tribesmen, worked and starved to death as they plunder their own lands serving the white man's insatiable quest for ivory. Before he reaches Kurtz, Marlow encounters other agents living on the edge, inured to the suffering of the Africans, while Marlow sees their humanity and questions his own darkness within. He is drawn to the charismatic voice of Kurtz, which he comes to know through stories told by others about him, and ultimately has a personal encounter with him following incidents of violence and psychological terror.
","The writing is dense and layered with symbolism and other literary devices, there is some challenging vocabulary, and there are complex themes best for mature teens. Conrad's classic novella maintains an impressive sense of dread while at the same time offering a searing critique of imperialism at a time when the expansion of the British Empire and the exploitation of Africa by European powers was glorified as bringing ""light"" to uncivilized populations. Kurtz's greedy pursuit of ivory, which consumes him and overrides and extinguishes any conscience or morality he once had, is a metaphor for the foreign policy of Conrad's day and remains relevant today.
Often required reading in high school, HEART OF DARKNESS is a powerful work of early modern fiction, full of psychological reflection and interior monologues by Marlow, who is trying to make sense of what he is seeing. (Conrad himself made a life-changing trip to the Congo with a Belgian company in 1890, serving as captain of a Congo River steamer, an experience that informs this novella.) Students may be pleased that it is only about 90 pages long, but it is not an easy read. Readers will find they must take it slow to grasp the nuances of Conrad's commentary and understand the historical context of imperial conquest, where racist domination of indigenous people was officially sanctioned by conquering countries. ","Parents need to know that Conrad's 1899 novella is an intense, suspenseful journey into the disturbed psyches of a rogue European ivory trader in the Congo and the British ship captain who pursues him, recounting the horrors he saw on his quest. Conrad exposes the racist, greedy nature of imperialism, and his story has led to many adaptations, including the 1979 Frances Ford Coppola film, Apocalypse Now, which substitutes Vietnam for Congo, yet retains the name of Kurtz for its elusive central character (played by Marlon Brando).

Tangerine,"A complex tale about teens, family relationships.","Paul Fisher can see things his parents can't, like how evil his older brother, Erik the football star, really is. He can see this even though he has been legally blind since an early-childhood accident he can't remember.
Now his family has moved to the bizarre town of Tangerine, where muck fires burn forever, lightning strikes at the same time each day, and half the school disappears into a sinkhole one afternoon. Paul's memories are starting to return--memories that lead to shocking revelations about his family. Meanwhile, he plays on the soccer team with the toughest Latino kids at school, kids who are beginning to accept him as one of their own.
","This complex, multilayered novel is impossible to synopsize briefly -- there's just too much going on, and every bit of it is engrossing and powerful. The author has a lot to say on a wide variety of subjects: race relations, child rearing, sports, class conflict, and more, but he does so in a book that is at once exciting, moving, strikingly original, and thought-provoking. Above all, TANGERINE is about the revelations that adolescents experience as they begin to step back and see their families through more detached eyes.
One 14-year-old said that the dizzying number of subplots could have been streamlined, for her taste, and that ""sections in the first half of the book were slow."" But this tale is richer and more inventive than most young-adult novels, so these seem like minor complaints. Bloor's first novel is a tour-de-force melding of the physical, intellectual, and emotional in a rich, resonant story.","Parents need to know that the contrasting brothers may hit a little too close to home for some families.

What's Going on Down There? A Boy's Guide to Growing Up,Modern update improves empowering sex ed classic.,"WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN THERE? A BOY'S GUIDE TO GROWING UP discusses the physiological and emotional changes boys -- and girls -- experience during puberty. It starts by discussing anatomy and physical changes with puberty. A chapter outlines how girls are changing too, explaining menstruation before discussing sexual intercourse, birth control, safe sex, and sexual exploration and mature relationships. An entire chapter is devoted to sexual harassment, explaining what it is, how to avoid doing it, and what to do if you're being harassed.
","The sexual landscape has shifted since Karen Gravelle first published this book for boys in 1998, and her welcome revision speaks to current concerns about social media, harassment, and body image. The frankness of What's Going on Down There? may prompt some blushing, but boys will be relieved to see so many of their common worries addressed. Gravelle goes beyond anatomical basics to explain why sexual harassment is a concern for everyone, to discuss the importance of the HPV vaccine, and to debunk myths about penis size and masturbation. Overall, the breadth and detail make this an excellent choice. But it makes a major misstep: A collection of men's thoughts on what they wished they knew as boys includes a quote about being ""a lot more aggressive with girls,"" and another that says ""what [girls] say isn't always what they mean."" Coming at the end of the book, these comments undermine earlier messages about consent and respecting the wishes of others.","Parents need to know that What's Going on Down There? A Boy's Guide to Growing Up is a detailed, informative text on sexual development, from physical changes to choices about sexual behavior. Author Karen Gravelle's 2017 update of her book, first published in 1998, adds new sections on sexual harassment, body image, and staying safe using social media. The book has a nonjudgmental tone and includes diagrams of external and internal male and female anatomy, along with straightforward, factual information on sexual activity, sexually transmitted infections, birth control, and more. It describes sex as a pleasurable activity, including masturbation alone and with others, and is clear about potential dangers and emotional complications. The book presumes readers are attracted to the opposite sex; homosexuality and transgender issues are discussed briefly. Cartoonish illustrations include many depictions of penises. Age 9 may seem young for this, but some boys that age are entering puberty. Adults should read this before sharing it with young children, and be prepared for follow-up conversations.

Sophomore Switch,Chick lit with a dose of feminism.,"Two college students -- British Emily and American Tasha -- trade classes and rooms in an exchange program. Tasha is fleeing ""Tubgate,"" a scandal that landed her half-naked on YouTube, while Emily hopes the California sun will help her forget a painful breakup. After a disastrous start for both, they exchange tips for fitting in to their different cultures. But just as Tasha joins a women's health protest and Emily loosens up a bit, reality crashes back in.
","Readers who pick up this book for its California vibe -- and Tasha's titillating misstep -- will get caught up before they realize McDonald did a bait-and-switch on them: This isn't total fluff. While it's no feminist manifesto, Tasha's empowerment seems authentic as she takes control of her own sexuality.
Teens will enjoy the culture clash as Tasha tries to wear Uggs and mini-skirts at Oxford and straight-A Emily learns to surf and inline skate at the beach. It may also get them thinking about respect and desire, and about letting ""dumb preconceptions rule"" one's life.","Parents need to know this novel is about college students and features a fair amount of drinking and casual sex, as well as some profanity. However, on a scale with the Gossip Girl series, for example, it ranks lower because neither of the main characters have sex and they both learn to respect themselves.

The Ghost in the Tokaido Inn,Historical details add depth to gripping mystery.,"Seikei, son of a tea merchant in 18th century Japan, dreams of being a samurai and poet. But in the strictly ordered class system of the time this is impossible -- he can only look forward to following in his father's footsteps, a life for which he has little aptitude or interest.
While staying at the Tokaido Inn with his father during a business trip, Seikei sees what he believes to be a ghost steal a ruby belonging to a powerful and ruthless lord. When he speaks up to defend a family unjustly accused of the theft, Judge Ooka is impressed with his courage, and employs him to help track down the real thief, launching a journey that takes him into the world of the Kabuki theater.
","Readers will find this story about a young boy who wants to be a samurai both an engaging mystery and an intriguing introduction to the historical and cultural details of shogun-era Japan. The Way of the Warrior (Bushido); poetry; tea tasting and ceremonies; the complexities of Kabuki theater; the difficulties of travel; and lots more are lovingly detailed by the authors, and may prompt kids to want to learn more about this fascinating era.
Seikei himself is an appealing protagonist. Torn between what he wants and what is expected of him, he is fearful yet courageous, uncertain yet determined, and the resolution of both the mystery and his path in life is satisfying indeed. The bottom line: This is a treat that kids will both love -- and learn from.","Parents need to know that, as is historically accurate, the ritualized suicide known as seppuku is treated as an honorable act.

Once she was a little girl just like Katie and she loved fancy shoes, dancing on trash can lids, and eating frosting roses.
","This book captures the cozy feeling of listening to a parent share their childhood stories -- from the times they got into trouble or behaved less than perfectly to the games they loved to play. What a pleasure it is to know that parents really do understand why siblings argue and why it's so hard to be quiet when mom is on the phone. Kids will get the picture that parents are people with their own likes and dislikes, even if they're too busy with grocery lists and bills to always indulge their interests.
Very young kids may not quite understand that the mom in the story is not the same as the mom who might be reading the story, but older kids probably will be inspired to cuddle up and ask their parents about their own best memories. LeUyen Pham's adept watercolors use soft brown tones to lend a sepia tint to the mother's memories, making it easy for readers to recognize what is a present-day picture and what isn't.","Parents need to know that this sweet and cozy book is an conversation starter with preschoolers about that crazy idea that you were young once, too.

On the Road to Mr. Mineo's,Leisurely small-town comedy of homing pigeon on the lam.,"Mr. Mineo, who lives in a rusted trailer by the lake in sleepy Meadville, SC, and runs the local bait shop, took in his brother's homing pigeons when the brother went to live in a nursing home. Everything's fine until one day Sherman, a one-legged bird who's a bit full of himself, doesn't come home from the daily flight. Before the tale winds to its happy conclusion, Sherman and his new friend, the little brown dog, are being pursued not just by Mr. Mineo but also by assorted kids and adults determined to capture the bird -- not to mention some hungry cats bent on having pigeon for lunch.
","The leisurely, repetitious pacing of the narrative lends itself to being read aloud and serves to keep young readers well grounded in the story, but may be too slow for those who prefer fast action. The plight of some of the characters -- Stella, who's given up hope of persuading her parents to let her have a dog, but now dreams of capturing Sherman; her wimpy friend Gerald, frequent recipient of the Knuckle of Death from Stella's brother Levi and his gang of bullies; Mutt, from the wrong side of the tracks, who's got such a reputation as a liar that no one believes him when he tells the truth -- will strike a sympathetic chord with many kids.","Parents need to know that On the Road to Mr. Mineo's is long on leisurely Southern small-town atmosphere, which may not suit impatient young readers. But the adventures of Sherman the runaway one-legged pigeon, which involve being pursued by kids who want to make him a pet as well as cats who want to make him a meal, have a lot of charm and appeal. And many kids will appreciate young Stella's difficulties with her obnoxious older brother, not to mention parents who won't let her have a dog.

Burning Midnight,"Sci-fi scavenger hunt tale has lots of action, suspense.","Seventeen-year-old David Sullivan works at a local flea market, buying and selling the brilliantly colored spheres that have become worldwide sensations. No one knows where they came from, but the spheres amplify the physical abilities of those people lucky enough to find a pair and ""burn"" them. When Sully meets Hunter, a girl with a knack for finding hidden spheres, they team up and start a quest for fame and fortune, battling long odds and the schemes of a high-powered rival who will stop at nothing to win.
","Although it seems to ignore some of the implications of its central premise, this novel about a global hunt for mysterious, colored spheres has plenty of action and suspense. Sully, Hunter, and Dom are engaging characters, and their schemes to find and sell spheres are recounted with wit and verve.
What's a little disappointing about BURNING MIDNIGHT is that no one seems to wonder much about who or what created the spheres. It's an event that would reshape global economies, but author Will McIntosh seems unwilling to grapple with that level of world-building complexity. Burning Midnight is definitely a contender for the attention of science-fiction fans, but a bit more depth could have made it a champ.","Parents need to know that Burning Midnight is a science-fiction thriller by Will McIntosh, about a global scavenger hunt to locate mysterious multicolored spheres that amplify human talents. For the first two-thirds of the book, the level of violence is low (some rough manhandling by some bodyguards and a shoot-out in a hotel room), but a massive plot twist ramps it up at the end, with some deaths but no graphic details.

Pure,Gritty post-apocalyptic story with strong heroine.,"PURE begins many years after the Detonations -- a series of bombings that destroyed much of the world and caused everyday objects (and in some cases humans) to be fused with people. It's in this post-apocalyptic world that 16-year-old Pressia Belze, who can barely remember life before the Detonations, hides from the military police and occasionally gazes upon the Dome, where a small portion of the population was protected from the destruction (and remains physically \""pure\""). Pressia stumbles upon Partridge, the son of the mastermind behind the Detonations, who has escaped from the Dome in hopes of finding his mother. They join together with a defector from the Secret Police and an underground rebel to seek out Partridge's mother and in the process learn more about Pressia's mysterious past.
","Brisk, detailed, and strangely compelling, Julianna Baggott's first book of the Pure trilogy combines grotesque images with strongly moral characters who feel real despite their dystopian setting. As teens, both Pressia Belze and Partridge Willux are questioning their identities and developing their values. Driven by their internal sense of right and wrong, they fight to both uncover their personal secrets and find some justice in the midst of an unfair division between the ""pures"" and the ""wretches,"" or those who were protected from the devastating Detonations, and those who were not.
Baggott's writing is particularly lovely, evoking tender feelings, heightened emotions, and the brutal landscape of her imagination. Teen and adult readers will be spooked by the gruesome imagery, but fascinated, too. Readers can draw connections between the items fused to each character (such a as a doll head fused to a hand) nd that individual's personality, as well as connections between the moral issues related to power and corruption and real-life politics and culture. Running throughout the story is the teen-friendly theme of accepting yourself and being proud of what makes you unique.","Parents need to know that Pure is the first in a post-apocalyptic YA trilogy and features plenty of grotesque imagery and several violent, bloody conflicts, a few that end in death or injury. In one scene a parental figure dies in a sudden, bloody manner. Characters use guns and knives to defend themselves, and there is a somber tone throughout. A few critical or questioning references to God and Christianity might upset some readers. Characters occasionally use strong language.

Will Ember be able to convince Alistair that she's not a traitor? Can she protect her sister, as well as her beloved Barrow and the Knights of Contatus, from the sinister Bosque Mar?
","RISE is an interesting but slow-moving addition to the Nightshade series. It's by far sexier and steamier than Rift, the first prequel, but Rift is more exciting and action-packed. All the political talk in Rise and scenes where not much happens might bore some readers. Yet, it picks up speed toward the end.
Readers will also have fun discovering how the werewolves in the Nightshade series were created, and by whom. The novel moves back and forth between the stories of Ember and Barrow and those of the villains -- Eira, Bosque Mar and Alistair. However, the villians' storyline becomes tiresome, especially Alistair's obsessive love for Ember.

And, since Flying Duck is deaf, Ruby has to try even harder to help her fit in with the group of friends on 20th Avenue South, at the swim lessons Ruby already hates, and at school. Then there's Ruby's little brother, Oscar, whom she loves -- except when he's getting into her stuff or telling her secrets.

","The message throughout this series -- always try to be a good person and do the right thing, even when it's hard -- is rock solid. And it's reinforced with silly adventures, tough circumstances, and poignant moments. Ruby's situations are relatable -- she's terrified of swim lessons, sometimes picks fights with her friends because she's upset about something else, and wants to do her best but doesn't always know how. Ruby's multicultural neighborhood and immigrant family bring  refreshing perspective that's often missing in children's books.
However, the writing in the Ruby Lu series might not grab reluctant readers, especially those who don't read the series installments in order.

Letters from Felix: A Little Rabbit on a World Tour,Stuffed bunny writes home about world adventures.,"After Felix, Sophie's stuffed rabbit toy, disappears at the airport, Sophie starts receiving letters from him as he travels around the world.

Small illustrations by The Brothers Hilts at the start of each chapter help bring the distinctive protagonists Lee, Felix, and Gretchen to life.","Parents need to know that The House in Poplar Wood is a riveting tale of 13-year-olds growing up in a Tennessee village ruled by the Shades -- Passion, Memory, and Death -- and their attempts to free themselves and their families. Much of the trouble (and two twins' existence) dates from a time when two teens who never should have met fell in love and the girl became pregnant. A teen's violent death causes suspicion and sets assorted events in motion. Protagonists Lee, Felix, and Gretchen are strong individuals struggling with family legacies they want to escape, as well as the daily hassles of middle school. There are strong messages of friendship, family, courage, taking care of each other, and doing the right thing even when you have to figure out for yourself what that is.

Hello Goodbye Dog,Warm story of girl and her exuberant therapy dog.,"In HELLO GOODBYE DOG, Zara's dog, Moose, rides along with her to school, escapes the car, and tries to go to class with her. Zara's parents catch him and bring him home, but Moose zooms out nd appears back at class, settling at Zara's feet while the teacher reads a story. When Moose is again captured, nd tied up in the backyard, he chews through the rope, returning to school to cuddle with the kids who are reading in the library. Each time he's caught, Moose manages to escape and return. Finally, Zara gets the idea to enroll Moose in therapy dog school, and with his graduation certificate clutched proudly in his mouth, he's cleared to return to school, this time earning an official welcome as ""Class Reading Dog.""
","It's hard not to warm to this story of a girl and the dog who loves her, since tenderness radiates out from every page. Hello Goodbye Dog encourages us to consider the point of view of the pup, who views every encounter in emotionally simple terms, either happily as ""hello,"" or as a distressing ""goodbye."" Author Maria Gianferrari adds a fun cumulative element, adding more and more people to catch Moose each time he returns to the school. Since Gianferrari relies on the various ""hello"" and ""goodbye"" encounters to structure the story -- ""Hello was a pat on the head."" ""Goodbye was being tied up in the backyard."" -- the story can sometimes be harder to follow than if the plot had been laid out more directly.
Much of the warmth is communicated by Patrice Barton's lovely art. Though no mention is made in the text, Barton pictures Zara as a multiracial girl who uses a wheelchair, and peoples the school with faces of all races. Her faces are so appealing, including the exuberant -- sometimes hangdog -- face of Moose. This is a lovely story to share, with the affection between the girl, the dog, and all in the school, touchingly real.","Parents need to know that Hello Goodbye Dog by Maria Gianferrari, illustrated by Patrice Barton (The Year of the Three Sisters), is a sweet girl-and-her-dog story that introduces the idea of a therapy dog coming to class to help with reading. The main character is  girl of color with one brown-skinned parent and one white, and she uses a wheelchair. Her school is happily integrated, with kids and staff of all hues. The cheery school setting and high-spirited pup make this a very fun read.

"Felix, What Time Is It?",The presentation of time-telling is confusing.,"The author begins with a discussion of different types of clocks, then moves on to a brief history of timekeeping. Next is a spread about the modern clock and its way of showing quarter and half hours.
The rest of the book is one day in the life of Sophie's family, with times given for getting up, going to school, Dad's appointment, meals, and activities. It ends with everyone going to sleep.
","This is an anomaly in the series: Felix doesn't travel, there are no letters or other surprises, and it's printed in board-book format with a circular cutout that allows a toy clock to show through. Unfortunately, the pages do not refer to the clock, so its usefulness is limited. The book is intended to teach telling time, but its presentation is confusing and at too high a level for the age at which most kids learn to tell time. And the board-book format is likely to seem babyish to many children old enough to understand the presentation.","Parents need to know that this book is intended to teach telling time, but its presentation is confusing and at too high a level for the age at which most kids learn to tell time.

Our Only May Amelia,A historical novel set in the Pacific Northwest.,"May Amelia hates to be told, ""Behave like a proper young lady."" She works on the farm as hard as any boy. Her birthday wish is for a little sister, but when baby Amy dies, she goes ""grief mad"" and runs away. Based on tales from her own family, author Jennifer L. Holm creates a believable heroine in a realistic historical setting.
 ","This historical novel vividly captures the harsh and lonely life of a girl living in the Pacific Northwest at the turn of the 20th century. The author builds excitement and suspense into each chapter: Chased by an angry mother bear and a cougar and nearly swept away by logs sent downriver from a logging camp, May Amelia seems to remain alive only by virtue of a string of luck. And readers learn that some things don't change in a hundred years: Brothers and sisters argue, parents set rules, and children run away.
To write this story, Holm delved into her family history: Her great-grandfather was one of the first Finnish-American settlers in the Nasel River Valley, but it was her grand-aunt's diary that inspired the title character.","Parents need to know that though May Amelia is a girl, this book has boy appeal too; six brothers and a male cousin share in her adventures.

"Ink, Iron, and Glass","Science, romance, alt-history mix in genre-bending tale.","As INK, IRON, AND GLASS opens, 16-year-old Elsa is looking forward to more responsibility for her native Veldana, a ""scribed"" (authored) world her scriptologist mother has succeeded in making independent of its Earth creator and enhancing ever since. But after her mother is abducted and her work stolen, Elsa travels to Earth to get her back. Landing in an alternate version of 19th-century Italy, she quickly finds herself in the Casa della Pazzia, an unusual (and sentient) dwelling where the Order of Archimedes keeps ""mad"" kids, i.e. those with genius skills in scriptology, alchemy, or mechanics, to keep them safe from the Church, which wants to kill them, and ambitious political leaders, who want to use their skills to grab power. Elsa, it turns out, is good at all three specialties, which makes her a really big target. It's a lot for her to take in, even without tragic, good-looking Leo in the picture.
","Clockwork bugs, swordplay, alchemy, flamethrowers, monster machines, virtual reality, politics, romance -- you've seen it all before, but rarely in such a genre-bending gallop to the cliff's edge. Ink, Iron, and Glass takes readers to a steampunk-ish 19th century Italy where history's taken a different turn, an arch-villain has his own plans on the subject, and a girl from another world finds herself dealing with romance in this one:
""He was like a fine piece of clockwork that had been carelessly dropped too many times, the delicate gears jarred apart so they spun and spun but never connected. Broken. ... Oh, how she itched to open his chest and set the gears straight again. The thought surprised her; she'd often felt the urge to fix objects, but this sudden desire to fix a person ... where did that come from?""","Parents need to know that Ink, Iron, and Glass is the first book in a planned two-part series by scientist, science fiction writer, and first-time novelist Gwendolyn Clare. Set in an alternate-universe, divided 19th-century Italy in which Garibaldi's unification efforts failed, it's a clever mashup of genres (steampunk! science fiction! historical fiction! gaming! virtual worlds!) and well-worn themes (teens who don't know each other forced to work together; being the new kid in school; villains bent on world domination; fictional characters rising against their creators...) into an exciting, snarky read with a ripple of romance,  a hefty dose of science, life lessons aplenty, and a cliffhanger ending. There's a bit of romantic tension and two intense kisses between the 16-year-old protagonists; also a lot of violence, from politically power-mad assassins to swordplay, stabbings, and mechanical monsters. A teen character drowns his sorrows in wine and pays the price with an epic hangover. Occasional ""hell,"" ""damn,"" ""goddamn,"" ""bastard.""

#NeverAgain: A New Generation Draws the Line,Compelling story of how Parkland shooting inspired activism.,"#NEVERAGAIN: A NEW GENERATION DRAWS THE LINE begins with siblings David and Lauren Hogg giving separate accounts of the Valentine's Day 2018 shooting at their Florida high school that left 17 people dead, 14 of them students. These gripping, heartbreaking accounts portray terrified students huddled in classrooms, holding hands with friends or strangers as they feared for their lives and texted with friends nd family members to get or give information. The book then gives backstories of what David nd Lauren's lives were like before the shooting -- growing up in California, adjusting to a new school in Florida, getting involved in debate club and a TV production class, and in David's case, growing from a low-achieving, dyslexic student to a star in AP classes and student journalism, engaged and politically aware. He becomes politically active after his comments in interviews following the shooting thrust him into the media spotlight. Lauren joins the #NeverAgain movement with him, and together they continue in efforts to stop gun violence. ","This compelling memoir and manifesto shows how teens responded to a tragedy in their community by standing up and demanding that adults in power do something to prevent it from happening again. The usual ""thoughts and prayers"" from politicians was not enough for them -- they demanded action. #NeverAgain: A New Generation Draws the Line is written in authentic, articulate teen voices, which should be particularly effective in reaching young readers. David writes that ""we hope that seeing things through our eyes will give you ideas of your own. Because none of us can do this alone and we need you, basically.""
David is self-deprecating and admits to sometimes being ""a jerk"" in middle school but also shows how finally connecting with caring teachers helped him grow up, become engaged and self-disciplined, and do well in high school. He explains that his eventual activism was grounded in all he'd learned about American history, government, politics, journalism, media, and even the gun control issue in his classes and on the debate team. Lauren shares the depths of her grief -- she lost two close friends in the shooting -- and how her commitment to working for change grew. David and Lauren's loving, supportive relationship and their warm, respectful relationship with their parents (their mom, an elementary school teacher and their dad, an FBI agent) is also an inspiring model. ","Parents need to know that #NeverAgain: A New Generation Draws the Line is a slim, small-format nonfiction book written by David Hogg, 17, and his sister, Lauren Hogg, 14, survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, on Valentine's Day, Feb. 14, 2018. It is both a memoir of their experiences before, during, and fter the shooting and a call for other young people to stand up, become socially active, nd urge politicians to take action to stop gun violence. Their gripping, alternating ccounts of what happened on that day include mentions of blood and seeing teachers and students dead on the floor. There's infrequent strong language (""hell,"" ""ass,"" ""badass,"" ""s--t,"" as in ""get your 's--t' together,"" ""s--tty,"" ""pissed off""; David recalls getting in the car after the shooting, overcome, and repeatedly yelling ""f--k""). The Hogg family will donate proceeds from the book to charity and local community organizations. Publisher Random House will also donate some proceeds in the Hoggs' name to the American nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety.

"Leroy Ninker Saddles Up: Tales from Deckawoo Drive, Volume One",Silly cowboy adventure perfect for new chapter-book readers.,"Inspired by the Western movies he loves, Leroy Ninker buys Maybelline the horse. Though Maybelline is old and has only four teeth and Leroy has never ridden a horse in his life, it's mutual love at first sight. Instructed to give Maybelline lots of compliments, Leroy finds a poetical side of his nature he didn't know he possessed, and Maybelline thrives on his sweet talking. But when Leroy forgets that Maybelline hates being alone, disaster strikes: She runs away! In the middle of a horrible thunderstorm, Leroy must search high and low for his beloved horse.
","LEROY NINKER SADDLES UP features the same delightfully silly but sweet flavor as that in author Kate DiCamillo's Mercy Watson series, which takes place in the same town. The short, action-filled chapters with occasional illustrations make this a perfect book for early readers graduating to slightly longer chapter books. ","Parents need to know that Leroy Ninker Saddles Up is a fun and funny story about a man who dreams of being a cowboy and buys a horse and takes her home to his apartment. Anyone who's ever loved a pet will relate to Leroy's passion for Maybelline, ""the most beautified horse in the whole wide green world."" Leroy Ninker Saddles Up is the first in a new early-chapter book series by Newbery Award winner Kate DiCamillo, and readers of the Mercy Watson series will recognize Leroy and other characters. It's aimed at slightly older kids than the Mercy books, because it has more text and more pages, but a patient 5-year-old would be able to sit and listen to it being read aloud.

Almost Astronauts: 13 Women Who Dared to Dream,Women pilots fight for a chance to go to the moon.,"In 1960, pilot Jerrie Cobb underwent testing to show women could go up in space; she hoped scientific evidence would prevail against the era's gender discrimination. As Cobb and the other ""Mercury 13"" women -- dubbed ""Astrodolls"" and ""Astronettes"" by the media -- discovered, they were ahead of their time by nearly 40 years. With black-and-white pictures and personal anecdotes, Almost Astronauts weaves biographies of the female pilots into a larger history of the 1960s and changing gender roles.
","Stone offers a great mix of intimate details in this intriguing book about women in the space program. Included are descriptions of space tests (including a daunting description of an isolation chamber), telling facts about women pilots' lives (one mom of eight stocked her refrigerator with three carts of food before leaving her family), and appalling examples of social and political discrimination.
She explains the historical context for young readers who won't otherwise understand why it was such a big deal that women wanted to go into space. As Stone notes, for women to prove they could equal the nation's space heroes -- the guys with the ""Right Stuff"" -- ""they would have to show not only that they were as tough or tougher, but that they could do it with a smile, never stepping out of the role of the polite, cooperative lady.""","Parents need to know there is no bad language, sex, or violence in the book.

Odd and the Frost Giants,Mythic fantasy adventure has a tender heart.,"Odd is a misfit in his Norse village. After the death of his father and an accident that leaves him crippled, he doesn’t seem to be much use to anyone. The villagers are growing restless as winter refuses to cede to spring, and Odd heads into the forest. He runs into a bear, a fox, and an eagle who have been transformed and exiled from Asgard, the city of the gods. Asgard is in the hands of the Frost Giants, and winter will not end unless they are driven out. The exiles believe the situation is hopeless, but clever Odd heads to Asgard to confront the Frost Giants and save the mortal world.
","This satisfying, compact adventure invites kids to wrestle with some morally ambiguous material, and is  good introduction to the many shades of gray in mythology. The storytelling is focused and tight, and the climactic scene between Odd and the giant offers plenty for kids -- and adults -- to think about. This is a good one to read together, curled up on the sofa, on a wintry day.
Odd lives in a brutal time and place. Might rules and the less strong are bullied and cast aside. No one quite knows what goes on in Odd’s head, and readers don’t get too close to him either. But they readily empathize with him as he seeks the comforting presence of his late father, strikes out on his own, and matter-of-factly sets out to clean up the mess when the gods have thrown up their hands. It’s no surprise that the underdog will find a way to best the mighty Frost Giant, but the moment when Odd begins to strip away the bellowing bravado, the intimidating brute strength to lay bare a lovely truth is breathtaking. “I rule Asgard!” the giant thunders. “Why?” asks Odd. That simple question, one that is never asked enough, proves to be a mighty blow.","Parents need to know this mythological tale features some ugly behavior by both gods and men, but the under-appreciated, underestimated hero poignantly reveals that heart, not brawn, can win some battles. There is some drinking, trickery, greed, and brawling, most of it perpetrated by the gods. Odd’s mother was captured in a Viking raid but was treated lovingly by his father.

Dear Killer,Teen serial killer faces moral dilemma in gripping read.,"Trained from a very young age to carry on her mother's serial-killing tradition, Kit killed her first victim when she was only 9. Now that she's 17, her mother has retired from killing and Kit carries on alone. She's been dubbed the Perfect Killer because she never leaves a trace behind. She's proud of her record and even admits to enjoying killing. One day she receives a request to kill a classmate and decides to take on the challenge. When she learns that her intended victim is also the victim of an abusive boyfriend, she begins to question the truth behind what she was always taught, that there's no right and no wrong. As she continues to kill, she comes under the increasing suspicion of the police and eventually must decide between a life forever on the run or forever behind bars.
","Coming as it does from such a young author, DEAR KILLER is a remarkably mature achievement. The narrator's voice is rock solid and believable, and the story is very well constructed and realized. The book's not so much a page-turning thriller as it is a study in morality, but the compelling protagonist-killer and well-paced action hold the reader's interest in a vice-like grip.
A minor flaw that many teens won't notice, but if they do will take them out of the story at times, is the inauthentic vocabulary. The story's set in London, but Kit uses words like ""tennis shoe"" instead of ""trainer."" Her narrative voice lacks any sort of British cadence, and the occasional use of ""arse"" becomes a bit jarring in contrast. Again, a minor flaw, and we have every reason to look forward with high expectations to more from this talented young woman.","Parents need to know that Dear Killer, written by first-time uthor Katherine Ewell when she was 17 (she's still in college at Stanford), takes the reader inside the mind of a serial killer who's a high-school girl and typical teen in many ways. Blood's mentioned a lot and a couple of murders are described, one somewhat graphically. Overall, though, the violence is fairly mild given the subject matter, and the book is much more about Kit's journey to understanding morality and where it comes from than it is about the killing itself.

Ink,"Japanese setting, mythology more intriguing than characters.","Sixteen year-old Katie Green feels like a fish out of water in Amanda Sun's debut novel, INK. After her mother's death, Katie moves to Shizouka, Japan, to live with her aunt. Despite constantly worrying about being a ganjin (foreigner), as well as struggling with the language and culture, Katie makes friends and tries to make the best of it. But then mysterious Yuu Tomohiro steps into the picture and turns Katie's world upside down. And not just because he's cute. Tomo's an artist, and Katie notices that his drawings move. When even stranger things start to occur, including the thick ink that flows constantly in his presence, Katie becomes curious and follows him. When Katie come face-to-face with why Tomo's drawings come to life, she's not prepared to grasp Tomo's powerful connection to the ancient Shinto gods.
","Author Amanda Sun does a fairly good job creating an atmospheric novel set in a Japanese high school. The concept of Ink is interesting and unique, but it has a very Twilight feel. The mysterious guy who's untouchable and elusive and the girl who pines for him isn't anything new in YA literature. For the most part, Katie complains at every turn. She doesn't like living in Japan and she can hardly speak the language -- despite understanding what the other characters (who are speaking Japanese) say. Japanese words are scattered throughout, but it feels as if they're dropped in just to remind readers they're in Japan.
Katie instantly falls for Tomo. At first, he doesn't want anything to do with her, and who can blame him? She's a stalker. She follows him around everywhere, despite Tomo clearly expressing that he doesn't like it, and readers might not, either. What Ink does have going for it are Japanese culture, the feel of Japan, and the paranormal element of the Shinto gods.","Parents need to know that Ink is a supernatural story of gods and monsters set in Japan, and the first book in The Paper Gods series.

The Book of Wonders,Exciting adventure with girl hero and Arabian Nights flavor.,"Zardi has always longed for adventure, but she loves her family too much to leave them. This changes when an evil sultan picks her sister to be his next wife, which means that in 90 days she will die. It is up to Zardi and her best friend Rhidan to find the magical amulet that can help them overthrow the sultan. When they join Sinbad the Sailor's crew, it seems their path to success is a sure thing … until the ship gets stranded on a mysterious island filled with monsters and magical beings including, if Zardi can find her, a djinni. But the adventures don't end there -- even if Zardi finds the djinni, she must somehow get back home to rescue her sister before the sultan kills her.
","THE BOOK OF WONDERS has many elements of a classic adventure, starting with a brave heroine on a quest to find a magic talisman to help her save the day. During Zardi's journey she is challenged by a Cyclops, the queen of the snakes, and an evil wizard, and only through her bravery, intelligence, and loyalty can she emerge triumphant. Zardi is likable, spunky. and virtually perfect -- her only fault is feeling guilty when she doesn't help others enough. Obstacles are overcome easily, such as when she and her friends are attacked by Rocs (the mythical birds of prey), and Zardi suddenly discovers she can understand animal language. This may frustrate some readers but comfort others, especially those in the younger age range.
The action occasionally gets bogged down by flat dialogue and a distracting variety of dialogue attributes (characters whisper, warble, growl, and grind out their words). Still, for a reader who can't get enough swashbuckling action in exotic locales, this will serve nicely. A sequel is a given.","Parents need to know that this book may at first appear to be a retelling of The Arabian Nights, but isn't. Elements of the tales are there, however, including an evil sultan who kills his wives. Though Zardi and her friends are often placed in dangerous situations and some of her shipmates actually die, the danger to Zardi never seems too threatening because she is so resourceful and successful at solving problems. Kids who like adventures that are action-filled but reassuringly easy to get out of will enjoy this book.

Treasure Hunters,"Siblings search for artifacts, parents in fun series start.","Professor Kidd and his wife have raised their four children on the boat from which they travel around the world seeking treasure. But after their mom goes missing in Cyprus and their father disappears -- and possibly drowns -- during a storm, the kids decide to stay on the boat and continue their work. Along the way, they face constant peril from both the authorities and a band of scuba ninjas led by their father's nemesis, a fellow treasure hunter named Nathan Collier. But as they work together using their unique talents (Tommy is good at sailing, Storm is a genius and good with computers, and brother-sister twins Bick and Beck are tough and hardworking), they continue to discover real treasure. They also discover some big family secrets -- and even a way to get their mother back.
","Treasure hunting makes for a fun premise, of course, and the Kidd's constant run-ins with scuba ninjas, a Pirate King, and other crazy characters keeps TREASURE HUNTERS sailing along. Plus, most tween readers will enjoy getting to know the resourceful and loyal Kidd siblings: Handsome flirt Tommy is great at sailing the boat, overweight Storm is great with the computers and has a photographic memory, Bick, the older of a pair of strong-willed (and often arguing) twins is writing the story, and his twin Beck is the artist who illustrates his perspective -- offering her own take, as well. There's a lot of of gunplay throughout the the story, but the Kidds also use their other skills to get out of jams (Storm uses her knowledge of maritime law to outwit a police officer, for example). Some readers might be surprised at how quickly the Kidd kids move on after their father's sudden disappearance, but all in all, this first installment offers a smart setup for an adventurous, multi-volumed middle-grade series. Don't look for anything super deep in this first book, but it's certainly entertaining enough, and even educational at times as the Kidds look for (and sometimes find) historical artifacts. The big font and cartoon-like black-and-white illustrations that permeate the book and break up the text -- along with plenty of swashbuckling adventure on the high seas -- make this a good choice for reluctant readers.","Parents need to know that Treasure Hunters is the first book in a series by James Patterson and Chris Grabenstein (co-authors of I Funny: A Middle School Story) about treasure hunting siblings whose mother has been kidnapped, and whose father just disappeared during a storm.  Many guns are drawn, including spearguns and AK-47s. (Due to the gun content, we recommend this for kids 9-12, rather than the publisher's recommendation of 8-12.) One of the Kidd siblings is kidnapped and another one has two guns pointed right on her. Sharks encircle some villains after one of them is wounded and bleeding in the water. Besides all the adventure, there's an important message about families: The Kidd siblings each have their own strengths, but they value one another (and even cheer one another up when they make mistakes). Cartoon-like black-and white illustrations by Juliana Neufeld add to the fun and make for smooth sailing, even for reluctant readers.

Phoebe and Her Unicorn Series,"Funny, sarcastic graphic novels have layers of complexity.","In the PHOEBE AND HER UNICORN series, 9-year-old Phoebe is a happy misfit weirdo whose best friend is a unicorn named Marigold Heavenly Nostrils. No one -- parents, teachers, other kids -- think having a unicorn friend is odd because the ""shield of borningness"" Marigold enacted makes living with a unicorn seem perfectly normal. Phoebe deals with classmates who shun her because she's different, but Phoebe likes being weird. Her parents play video games with Phoebe, send her to music camp, and don't blink when their daughter starts a detective agency with the unicorn she rides to school. Phoebe faces everyday kid situations, but armed with a huge amount of confidence and a narcissistic unicorn, she has her own take on the world. At the end of each book are instructions for drawing the characters and other crafts.
","This series more than good; it's great. Phoebe and Her Unicorn is first and foremost a kids' series, but it's the rare graphic novel that works for adults, too. Phoebe is confident, smart, silly, and self-centered. Her unicorn, Marigold Heavenly Nostrils, is all of that -- and, like all unicorns, is also mesmerized by her own beauty. This series tackles issues of fitting in, popularity, loneliness, friendship, honesty and what it means to be yourself. One of Phoebe's best friends is a boy, Max, and sometimes Phoebe isn't sure how she feels about having a boy as a friend (a feeling that readers in this age group can likely relate to).
This series doesn't reach the emotional lows that a more adult-targeted comic strip would, but it mixes some angst and tough questions with the sparkles and giddiness of life with a unicorn.","Parents need to know that Dana Simpson's Phoebe and Her Unicorn series is very much about being true to yourself, whether you're a unicorn named Marigold Heavenly Nostrils or 9-year-old Phoebe, a confident, happy misfit. Phoebe loves being a weirdo, being different from other kids. She's confused about not being liked by someone she wants to befriend, but is confident enough in herself not to get too sad. She speaks like an adult but with a child's perspective -- a tough line for a character to walk, and it works beautifully. The sarcasm is heavy here, and the series reaches for both silly highs and emotionally bare lows; it's both moving and hilarious.

The Girl Who Thought in Pictures: The Story of Dr. Temple Grandin,Upbeat rhymes tell amazing tale of scientist with autism.,"THE GIRL WHO THOUGHT IN PICTURES: THE STORY OF DR. TEMPLE GRANDIN explores the life of an esteemed nimal scientist whose early life was fraught with difficulty. As a young Boston child diagnosed with autism, she was easily overstimulated nd couldn't relate to other kids or daily challenges. She didn't speak a word until she was 3 years old, but she was able to visualize thoughts and feelings through her ability to think ""in pictures."" Other kids were mean to her because she was ""different,"" nd she ended up getting kicked out of school for throwing a book at another student. Life wasn't easy -- until her mother sent her to live with family on a ranch out West. There she discovered she had an innate ability to connect with animals and understood their behavior in a way no one else could. For the first time in her life, she was encouraged by her talent and unique mind, and she conceived of new ways of working with livestock. She ultimately was able to harness her unique gifts, and today is a leading researcher and lecturer on animal science.
","Told in playful rhymes and with whimsical cartoon-like illustrations, this is a wonderful account of an inspiring woman. It offers a relatively candid look at what it can be like to live with autism and can help kids empathize with those who have learning and developmental difficulties. A note at the end of the book from Dr. Grandin herself is a great addition, reminding kids that The Girl Who Thought in Pictures is about a revered real-life scientist.
A handy section in the back titled ""Fun Facts and Tidbits From the Author's Chat With Temple"" breaks down some of her notable accomplishments and anecdotes in paragraph-length bites. One describes the 2010 HBO movie about her life staring Claire Danes. The illustrated timeline with photographs, as well as an ""About D. Temple Grandin"" section that details her story in more depth, help older readers and adults gain a deeper understanding of her life. ","Parents need to know that The Girl Who Thought in Pictures: The Story of Dr. Temple Grandin is in the Amazing Scientists Book Series created by author Julia Finley Mosca nd illustrator Daniel Rieley that celebrates female scientists throughout history. The Girl Who Thought in Pictures is a bright, uplifting account, told in upbeat verse, of revered animal scientist Dr. Temple Grandin. Grandin has autism, and her early life was fraught with difficulty as she faced severe developmental social, educational, and emotional challenges. With the support of family and a few loyal teachers, Grandin was able to overcome many obstacles and nurture a love of science. She revolutionized the care and treatment of animals in farms across the country, and today she is a leading researcher and lecturer on nimal science and contributes to the autism community as an advocate and spokesperson.

"UnSouled: Unwind Dystology, Book 3",Teens flee organ harvesters in action-packed installment.,"On the run from ProActive Citizenry, the Juvenile Authority, and vengeful parts pirates, Connor and Lev careen across the Southwest looking for a woman, nearly erased from history, who may hold the key to stopping \""unwinding\"" forever. When Lev is critically injured, they and a new companion, the odd but talented Grace, must depend on the kindness of others to survive. Meanwhile, Cam, the boy made completely of harvested tissue, continues his pursuit of Risa, who betrayed him.
","If you're looking for a conclusion to the Unwind ""trilogy,"" you won't find it in UNSOULED. But as an action-filled ride through a complex sci-fi setting, this installment probably won't disappoint you. Author Neal Shusterman keeps the suspense cranked high, and the characters in his twisty plots have more depth than many of their science-fiction counterparts. Good guys and villains alike have multiple and sometimes conflicting motivations. The character development adds a sense of realism to the somewhat unlikely science-fiction scenario. The ending leaves readers ready for a rousing series conclusion, whenever it might arrive.","Parents need to know that UnSouled is the third volume, but not the conclusion, of the ongoing Unwind ""dystology."" Set in a world where ""harvesting"" the organs of rebellious teenagers is normal, it raises compelling questions about medical ethics and free will. Violent episodes include beatings, stabbings, gunshots, lynching, and impalement with a farm tool. There's mild profanity and vulgar language -- occasional ""a--hole,"" ""damn,"" ""hell,"" ""bitch,"" ""piss,"" and ""crap."" An implicit sexual subtext avoids explicit detail: One character has amorous groupies; another impregnates three of his followers. Drug use is minimal and not always voluntary; one character is forced to smoke a mixture of cannabis and tranquilizer, and another ingests chocolate suffused with pot.

"Calamity: The Reckoners, Book 3",Explosive finale for action-packed superhero saga.,"At the start of CALAMITY, David Charleston's friend and mentor, Prof, has just been turned into his most dangerous enemy. David knows that, if humanity has any hope of survival, Prof must be defeated and rehabilitated. But how can someone reason with an Epic driven mad by his superpowers? David and the other Reckoners try every tactic imaginable to take the upper hand, but their strategies are foiled at every turn. Meanwhile, David's girlfriend Megan worries that she'll be seduced by the darkness, as well.
","Superhero action usually works best with a combination of words and pictures, but this near-future thriller succeeds with vivid prose alone. Having raised the narrative stakes across three volumes, author Brandon Sanderson delivers on his promises in Calamity. The suspense rarely flags, with David and his crew facing complications, reversals, and setbacks as they attempt to save the world and redeem themselves and their former mentor.
There's plenty of amusing banter and deftly handled character work, not to mention surprises galore. Sanderson nails the ending, providing satisfying psychological closure amid the superhero mayhem.","Parents need to know that Calamity is the final volume of the Reckoners trilogy by Brandon Sanderson, begun with Steelheart. It is a fast-moving, action-packed, clever take on superheroics, set at a time after supervillains have taken over the world. The body count runs fairly high as David and the Reckoners use everything from handguns to explosives against their enemies. ""Damn"" and ""hell"" appear a few times each, but the characters mostly use made-up curses: ""calamity"" or ""sparks,"" for example. David and his girlfriend Megan flirt and kiss, but their relationship does not progress far physically.

It's So Amazing!,Only parents know when it's time for this book.,"Starting with a chapter called ""Curious? Embarrassed? Confused?"" and explaining to kids that ""it's perfectly normal"" to feel that way about where babies come from, even if they think they know a few things already, the book then launches into all the big sex-ed questions: where babies come from, how boys and girls are the same and different and what male and female sexual organs actually do, how the sperm gets to its destination, what pregnancy and birth is like, and even the basics on chromosomes and genes. It also covers topics like different kinds of love (including homosexual love), different kinds of families, adoption, HIV/AIDS, birth control, what touches are ""okay"" and ""not okay"" and how to tell someone about ""not okay"" touches, and why growing up is ""so amazing.""
","Just like It's Not the Stork, this book does what it sets out to do in a very straightforward manner that all kids will appreciate -- they're not talked down to for a second. The book covers even more ground and gets where tweens probably are in their knowledge about such things -- they've gathered a few facts and some half-truths and some things that aren't so true and are embarrassed to admit that they can't tell the difference -- with some kids even deciding that they don't want to really know at all and what's the fuss all about anyway? The bird and bee cartoon characters that are present throughout do a good job of expressing both common kid viewpoints, and kids' reactions to these characters will help parents start good conversations with kids about what they're thinking. If you're only looking to discuss certain topics at certain times, the table of contents lays out each section very clearly.","Parents need to know that this straightforward, approachable sex-ed follow-up to It's Not the Stork is for older kids and digs into more topics that kids are bound to be hearing about as tweens -- which means you'll probably want to spend even more time previewing so you're ready to relay your feelings on some of the tougher topics. These include different kinds of families and love (with terms ""homosexuality"" and ""heterosexuality"" explained), HIV/AIDS, condoms and other birth control, masturbation, and a more detailed discussion of what sexual abuse is. The bird and bee cartoon characters that appear throughout and comment on the topics presented focus on two perspectives: a child who may be embarrassed to talk about such things and a child who doesn't understand why anyone would want to talk about them.

"The Wicked Will Rise: Dorothy Must Die, Book 2",Amy and her quest take a darker turn in imaginative sequel.,"Amy Gumm is still trapped in Oz, and Dorothy is still alive. Along with Ollie, Maude, and Ozma, Amy ends up in the Queendom of the Wingless, where she must figure out how to save the Revolutionary of the Wicked, search for Nox, and complete her mission by killing Dorothy. Amy also must learn to fight the darkness consuming her before she truly becomes something she most fears: being wicked.
","This series is brilliantly developed, and the world of Oz leaps off the page in vivid color, lush descriptions, and characterization. The Wicked Will Rise starts off right where Dorothy Must Die ends. Amy leaves behind the Emerald City and discovers more places nd creatures in Oz. Though readers might miss the Emerald City, author Danielle Paige continues to bring imaginative new landscapes into the picture. We also meet the hilariously trash-talking monkey, Lulu, Queen of the Queendom of the Wingless; Bright, who smokes rainbows, and his girlfriend, Polychrome; and Heathcliff on the Island of Lost Things. Readers encounter the evil Dorothy, the Lion, and Glinda, who is definitely not the Good Witch. The villains and monsters are pure evil but also have some funny lines. Their brutality and quest to hurt others for the sake of their own power will make readers cheer for Amy on her mission to save Oz.
Younger readers might cringe that the heroine is starting to become as violent as the villains. Yet there's a part of Amy that holds back, is afraid, and questions her mission, which makes her likable and multidimensional. The Wicked Will Rise is an action-packed story that ends with a cliffhanger, making readers eager for the next installment: Yellow Brick War, to be published March 15, 2016.","Parents need to know that The Wicked Will Rise is the second book in the bestselling Dorothy Must Die series, inspired by The Wonderful Wizard of Oz books and the 1939 film. After her adventures in the first book, Amy Gumm continues her journey through Oz to steal the Lion's courage and the Scarecrow's brains nd to kill Dorothy. She's also searching for her fellow members of the Revolutionary Order of the Wicked and her love interest, Nox. There are two kissing scenes. Amy encounters new magical lands and creatures, and there are a couple of violent scenes -- two characters are killed through use of magic, and one is eaten -- and descriptions of blood and gore, hand-to-hand combat, sword fighting, and stabbing with a sword. Strong language includes ""f--king"" and ""s--t."" The Wicked Will Rise is for fantasy fans who like darker tones and horror elements.

The Killer's Tears,Bleak award-winner of redemption through love.,"Paolo lives with his unloving parents at the end of the world -- the last house, a hut really, in southern Chile, an isolated, storm-wracked place where the land gives way to the southern seas. A stranger, Angel Allegria, arrives one day and murders Paolo's parents, but is unable to kill the boy. On the run from the law for previous crimes, he takes up residence in the hut and, very gradually, he and Paolo come to care for each other. Then into their harsh lives comes another stranger, Luis Secunda, an educated man looking to escape civilization. Paolo convinces Angel not to kill Luis, and so the three settle down for a while, and Luis begins to teach Paolo to read. But eventually they must head back to civilization to buy a few new farm animals, beginning a chain of events that leads to tragedy.
","This book is beautifully written and seamlessly translated, and it has a horrifying fascination. It has the kind of world-view that you don't see much in American children's literature: Life is hard, bleak, and mostly pointless, and the best we can do is soldier on. It's a melancholy world in which a child can love the man who killed his parents for no particular reason, and that love can redeem the murderer, who is executed anyway by an indifferent bureaucracy, leaving the boy alone in the world.
The book lyrically offers a cynical view that sees a world filled with misery, betrayal, and stupidity. But adolescents in their more dramatic moments can see things in the same way, and will find in this lethal prose-poem a truth that they think most literature hypocritically hides from them. Parents may want to suggest a less somber read to help wash this book down.","Parents need to know that this is a tough, bleak, and rather melancholy fable. A child's parents are murdered in their home by being stabbed in the throat, and a child attempts suicide. A cold-blooded murderer is also a sympathetic character. There is some implied sex and drinking. Even so, beautifully written and seamlessly translated, this winner of the French Prix Sorcieres is sure to get teen readers thinking about some tough philosophical issues, such as, is it possible for a murdered to become a good man?

Meet Me at the River,"Moving romantic read deals with grief, suicidal impulses.","After her boyfriend dies in an accident, Tressa isn't sure she wants to live and even attempts suicide. Now, instead of going to college with Luke, she's repeating her senior year, while her flaky mother and cold stepfather await a new baby. Tressa's happiest moments come when Luke's ghost visits her at night. They can talk about anything that happened before his death, but nothing that's happened since. As Tressa starts to make friends, she finds reasons to live in the present.
","Tressa's whole family situation in this compelling tale takes some sorting out. Her mother and Luke's father had a set of twins before splitting up, then got back together years after Tressa and Luke were born on the same day to different mothers. The reunited parents are understandably unhappy about the step-siblings' romantic relationship. Unrealistic and complicated as this might seem, it does set up Tressa and Luke as fated -- and doomed -- lovers. Although it seems as if it could easily feel clichéd, the ghost story is actually sweet and sad. It's Tressa's story, though Luke and Tressa take turns narrating. Readers will empathize with her daily struggle with grief after Luke's death and her sharp insight about life's randomness: ""All my life...I felt like I could never be sure of anything. When the truth is, that's how everybody lives. Nobody can be certain, ever, not for a single second."" Maybe the story goes on a bit long, but Meet Me at the River offers a sophisticated and satisfying look at loss -- and what it takes to move on afterward.","Parents need to know that Meet Me at the River is about a teen girl struggling with grief after an accident kills the boy she loves, who's also her stepbrother. Tressa even tries to kill herself and ends up temporarily in a mental hospital. The book mentions an adult character's suicide and a teen girl who cuts herself. There's some sexual material, including a scene in which a boy walks in on his father having sex. Tressa and Luke don't have sex, but they do kiss and lie naked together, and Luke had sex with his previous girlfriend. Parents could use this book to open discussions about grief, depression, and suicide.

"Jane, Unlimited","Five offbeat, inventive stories in one wild mansion.","In JANE, UNLIMITED, Jane is working in a book shop when she sees her old tutor, Kiran. When Kiran finds out that Jane's aunt and guardian has died in Antarctica, Kiran invites her to the family mansion to stay. Jane, a college dropout living with three grad students, immediately accepts the offer. The last promise she made to her aunt was that if she got an invitation to the mansion, a curious house on its own island in the Atlantic, she would not turn it down. She arrives there immediately after the invitation with all her things, including a flock of umbrellas she's been making in her spare time. The house is preparing for its annual gala, and some curious guests and residents are there. She meets Kiran's flirty twin brother, Ravi, the stern head housekeeper, Mrs. Vanders, art dealers, a doctor, the quirky and attractive Ivy, and a basset hound named Jasper who won't leave her alone. It only takes one night where she witnesses the doctor running off with a gun, and one morning, where Mrs. Vanders stares daggers at her, for her to realize the house is full of secrets. After breakfast she has to decide: Should she follow Mrs. Vanders, a little girl in the hall in distress, Kiran, Ravi, or the dog first to find out what's going on? Each path is explored independently, the story restarting completely after breakfast, and each path yields wildly different results.
","Art stealers and dealers, spies, sentient houses, parallel universes, uber-smart dogs, and lots of umbrellas all occupy one of the more inventive young adult novels you'll ever read. Luckily they don't all occupy the book at the same time, or at least not the way the main character, Jane, experiences the story. The story restarts after breakfast five times, each time heading in a totally different direction. And here's some of the genius of this multistory: While Jane is in one scenario, following spies, the house is still groaning about its secrets and the dog is still begging Jane to follow him. The reader has an awareness that they're only getting a part of this very complex puzzle and they're waiting to hear more with every story layer author Kristin Cashore delivers.
Jane, Unlimited isn't for everyone. It's one of those books that will be adored or panned, depending on the reader's openness to the offbeat and whether they reward or shun their favorite authors for taking real risks. This is nothing like the adored Graceling Realm series, fans. Prepare yourself first, and you will be rewarded with mini-velociraptors and so much more.","Parents need to know that Jane, Unlimited is an inventive stand-alone book by Kristin Cashore, the acclaimed author of the Graceling Realm series. The main character, Jane, in her late teens, is recently orphaned by the aunt who raised her. Jane is told that her aunt froze to death in Antarctica. Her parents died in a plane crash when she was a baby. The story follows five possible story threads. They all contain a little violence, with occasional gunplay involved. A man and a dog are shot, the man fatally. A woman's arm is crushed and mangled, a man is crushed to death. A character is in a state between life and death at the end of one scenario. Swearing is consistent in the dialogue and includes ""f--k."" Jane is surrounded by adults drinking but doesn't drink. She kisses both male and female characters, briefly. It's less the mature content and more the complexity and originality of the storytelling that dictates the right reader for Jane, Unlimited.

This Is Where the World Ends,"Dark, compelling tale of obsessive friendship, rape, death.","Eighteen-year-old Micah is in the hospital. There's a lot he doesn't remember, but he can tell something pretty bad has happened, especially since no one will give him a straight answer when he wants to know where his brilliant-but-troubled best friend, Janie, is. Also, the police keep wanting to talk to him about the fire that burned Janie's house down around the time she vanished. As the story unfolds and he struggles to piece together what's really going on, his often-confused narrative voice alternates with that of Janie, who may be a bit less in control than she thinks she is.
","A small-town teen with memory loss struggles to learn where his best friend is, why she left him, and why the police want to talk to him about her torched house in this dark, compelling page-turner. Author Amy Zhang, switching between the narrative voices of the two characters, weaves a complex, sometimes deceptive story -- some of which the reader may figure out before protagonist/narrator Micah does, and some of which is open to different interpretations -- as she reveals two complicated, relatable, not always likable characters who form their own world, and looks at what happens to them in THIS IS WHERE THE WORLD ENDS:
""The point was each other. They knew each other in their atoms, and the point was that they were together. They never talked about it, but they both knew what they feared. More than anything, they feared that they wouldn't have each other someday.
""And without each other, there wouldn't be much of a point at all, would there?""","Parents need to know that This Is Where the World Ends, author Amy Zhang's second novel (the first, Falling Into Place, dealt with teen suicide), is a dark, often compelling psychological study of relationships -- and what happens when an ""atom"" of two people who love each other ""more than anything"" crashes against a world of parents, school cliques, and crushingly boring small-town life. There's a lot of questionable behavior and strong language (including ""f--k"" and ""s--t""), and high school kids -- the two central characters turn 18 during the story -- smoke cigarettes and get drunk often. One drunken party includes date rape and suicide. A character torches a house. The action takes place very much inside the heads of the two main characters: One may not be sane, and the other is suffering from post-traumatic memory loss. There's a lot of suspense as the story unfolds; readers who enjoy complex explorations of what makes people tick will find a lot to think about, but there's not much light among the shadows.

Horrible Bear!,Girl blames bear in funny story about anger and forgiveness.,"In HORRIBLE BEAR!, a girl's kite gets broken by accident when it falls into a bear's cave. Girl blames Bear -- ""HORRIBLE BEAR!"" -- and Bear is angry at the girl for blaming and disturbing him -- ""RAWR!"" But all the anger is defused when the girl breaks something herself and, after realizing how easy it is to have an accident, apologizes to Bear: ""And all the horrible went right out of Bear."" Together, they skip through the meadow, bounce up the mountain, patch the kite, and ""Nothing was horrible at all … ."" Bear then comes up with some ""Sweet Bear ideas,"" as does the girl -- though the reader sees that -- uh, oh! -- a goat's now munching on the kite string.
","Readers will recognize themselves and learn a thing or two about strong emotions in this fun, colorful story about the runaway force of anger and the disarming power of forgiveness. Author Dyckman has a knack for combining humor with emotional truths, and illustrator OHora delivers a charming spitfire of a character with a mess of red curls as unruly as her emotions. The girl's angry at the bear, the bear's angry at the girl, and both of them stomp and shout. The story turns and illustration are lots of fun -- haven't we all felt anger at friends? -- and kids can chime in as the girl shouts ""HORRIBLE BEAR!"" and the bear growls ""RAWR!""
There are jokes embedded in the art, with pictures of books about bears and a cameo from Dyckman/OHora's Wolfie the Bunny, and the book cleverly sidesteps a too-pat happy ending by showing another mishap-in-the-making: After the girl and bear mend the kite, we see a goat nibbling on it.","Parents need to know that Horrible Bear! by Ame Dyckman and Zachariah OHora, the same team that collaborated on bestselling Wolfie the Bunny, is a funny book about a small accident with a broken kite and the anger and finger-pointing that result.

The Night Circus,Illusionists compete in dream-like literary romance.,"In the latter years of the 19th century, Le Cirque des Reves (""Circus of Dreams"") travels from town to town cross Europe and America, always arriving without warning and only opening after sundown. The circus is secretly the setting for a contest between two gifted illusionists, Marco and Celia, but neither one knows, at first, who their adversary is or what the exact nature of the challenge might be. As the consequences of the game become clearer, Marco and Celia must decide whether they can pursue their love for each other without destroying themselves or the circus.
","THE NIGHT CIRCUS is a rich, dreamy tale of theatrical enchantment and thwarted love. Erin Morgenstern writes with grace and flair and walks the fine line between the lyrical and the precious. After a while, the nebulous nature of the illusionists' challenge puts a drag on the narrative, but all the elements come together beautifully at the book's climax. The Night Circus is reminiscent of the best of Ray Bradbury, though without his darkest edge.","Parents need to know that this fantasy novel depicts a circus where two young illusionists compete in some barely understood challenge.

Edie lways knew that her mother was adopted and had been raised in a White family, but she didn't think to press her mom on the topic, until she and her friends discovered a mysterious box tucked into a corner of the attic. Inside the box are rtifacts of a life lived before Edie's time, but the connections to her mother's past prove to hold more pain than Edie had expected. ","This beautifully and simply told tale explores the ripple effects of a long-held family secret. Though couched in the rhythms of a loving family's life in modern-day Seattle, the sad truths of the past pierce  tween's life, and her rage at being left out of the unspoken past feels appropriate and proportional.
Inside of this loving, if basic, tale lies some serious truth. As Edie's mom says, ""For many years, Native children were forcibly removed from their families and communities."" The author, who identifies s the ""daughter of a Native American Upper Skagit/Nooksack/Blackfeet/Nez Perce adoptee,"" is making a point: U.S. history is full of tragic stories of coercion and force. I Can Make This Promise lets this truth rise up subtly in the telling, and kids will ppreciate the activist spirit that underlies the story.","Parents need to know that I Can Make This Promise is a heartfelt story about a family whose connection with its Native American heritage has been disrupted. Family secrets are uncovered, the theme of coerced adoption is brought up, and a glimpse into life on a reservation is briefly explored. Identity is the theme, as people ask the main characters, who have Native American roots, where they are from, ""what"" they are, telling them how exotic they look. There's some slight bullying among friends.

Dry,Gripping disaster novel imagines California without water.,"At the start of DRY, the simple act of turning on a water faucet heralds the arrival of a major diaster. Alyssa's parents assure her and her younger brother, Garrett, that everything will be fine once the authorities arrive with fresh water. But their odd neighbor, survivalist Kelton, believes it will be every person for herself. As people get more desperate and discomfort suddenly veers into tragedy, Alyssa, Garrett, Kelton, and others set out to find a refuge where they'll be safe. To get there, they'll test their courage and humanity, struggling not to descend into mindless violence.
","Lots of readers have climate change on their minds, and this gripping, sophisticated disaster novel vividly shows the perils of rising temperatures. In Dry, the father-son Shusterman team steadily builds the level of suspense as their complex and surprising characters fight to survive. Each member of the cast is multidimensional, and the authors take pains to present them with moral questions that have no easy answers. The novel's ending may strike some readers as a little too easy, but it's satisfying to see these characters mostly rewarded for their bravery.","Parents need to know that Dry, written by Neal Shusterman and his son, Jarrod Shusterman, is a realistic portrayal of what might happen if Southern California suddenly were to run out of water. As the ""Tap-Out"" continues, the characters must make difficult decisions about whom to help. Violence increases with thirst, and characters are subjected to beatings, shootings, and fire, frequently fatally. Swearing is infrequent (""hell,"" ""damn,"" ""a--hole""). A minor character trades unspecified sexual favors for water.

"The 78-Story Treehouse: The Treehouse Books, Book 6",Jealousy pits friend against friend in rambunctious story.,"Best friends Andy and Terry are thrilled to be making a movie instead of a book in THE 78-STORY TREEHOUSE. But excitement turns to drama when the director cuts Andy from the movie. Terry starts acting like a big star, making Andy's stand-in -- a gibbon -- his new best friend. Dejected, Andy is left on his own in the activity-packed tree house. No one pays him any attention, not even when he warns everyone on set that spy cows are trying to steal the movie. The friction between the ex-best friends comes to a head over a missing bag of potato chips. It takes a court case and an epic space battle to settle the dispute -- and unite the boys so they can finish their story, despite the spy cows.
","Andy and Terry's friendship anchors their wild adventures in the sprawling, fun Treehouse  Books, but this time friction over a movie deal -- and expected fame and fortune -- nearly ruins everything. Author Andy Griffiths and illustrator Terry Denton pile on the lunacy with every 13-story addition, and The 78-Story Treehouse is no exception. Spy cows trying to steal the movie lurk on every page, and the boys reach their breaking point over a missing bag of chips.
Andy's hurt feelings ring true: He's jealous, sure, but really he's worried Terry is going on to grander adventures and will leave him behind. The resolution of their feud is a little too easy, but then this is the kind of book where a key plot point involves a turbo tortoise ... probably best not to overthink it, and just enjoy the wild ride.","Parents need to know that The 78-Story Treehouse is the sixth book in the over-the-top comic Treehouse series about creative friends Andy and Terry and their wild adventures in a dangerously fun, ever-growing tree house. This time, the boys are making a movie instead of a book, and the project strains their friendship: Terry lets success go to his head, and Andy wallows in his hurt feelings and acts like a bad sport. The boys' tree house is packed with wild activities like three areas full of clones, a stadium for playing all ball sports at once, and a tank of man-eating sharks. The friction between the boys escalates into a ridiculous court case and then a physical fight in space where the boys kick, spit at, smash, and shove each other. Beneath the zany antics are messages about creativity, friendship, and empathy. The publisher recommends this series for ages 6 and older, but we recommend it for ages 8 and up do to the comic violence and length.

Cardboard,Fantastic action-meets-existentialism graphic novel.,"Broke and unemployed carpenter Mike brings home the \""worst present in the history of birthdays\"" to his son Cam -- a giant CARDBOARD box. After son and father work together to build a boxer named Bill out of the cardboard, they are surprised to find that he comes alive. Soon Cam is building all sorts of tiny creatures out of the scraps, even a model of his deceased mother. But when the neighborhood bully -- a spoiled rich kid -- finds out that Cam has a cooler toy than he has, he steals the cardboard away and ends up building himself into a major mess. He'll need forgiveness from Cam and the power of Mike and Bill to rescue him.
","At times poignant and sweet, Cardboard is mostly packed with action that's highlighted by TenNapel's cartoony illustrations. Eyes bulge, fists loom large, and sound effects go ""crash!"" and ""boom!"" and ""pow!"" Even with the specter of a deceased mom and an unemployed dad, kids will revel in the fantasy of creatures made out of cardboard who come to life.
The villain, Marcus, who resembles the toy-torturing neighbor of the first Toy Story movie, is incredibly mean and rude. But as his mean creations rise up to destroy him, he looks deep within his psyche, confronts his flaws, and with the help of Cam's friendship, finds redemption. The interactions between fathers and sons are especially tender, and will have a deeper meaning for adults.","Parents need to know that Cardboard is a fabulous graphic novel with lots of action sequences, a vicious bully, and references to a mother's death. The somber tone throughout much of the story may not work for all kids, and there are hints of edgier topics like unemployment, loneliness, and adult romance, but most kids will glaze over these issues and focus on the wild images and fantastic idea of building living creatures out of cardboard.

"The Burning Maze: The Trials of Apollo, Book 3",Evil Caligula reigns again in high-action Apollo sequel.,"In THE BURNING MAZE, Apollo, in the body of a mortal teen named Lester; Meg, daughter of Demeter; and Grover, a satyr, follow the labyrinth to locate the third oracle. When they're attacked by giant cursed birds named strixes and nearly disemboweled, they know they're close to their destination. They emerge in the Southern California desert in a place Meg doesn't want to remember. Greenhouses built by her now-deceased father surround them. Most were burned out during an attack years ago when Meg was young and was forced to flee. Some dryads still live there and explain that many of their kind have died in fires or gone missing looking for the source of an intense burning under the Earth. Suddenly reentering the maze to locate the third oracle has gotten a lot more dangerous. Even with reinforcements -- Piper, daughter of Aphrodite -- the odds are against them when Medea shows up in her dragon-pulled chariot. And she's not even the worst villain of the lot. It's the infamous mad and extravagant emperor Caligula she's aiding. With the mysterious fire under the Earth and Apollo's death, she plans to make Caligula more powerful than ever before.
","The third book in this fallen-Apollo series sets a fast pace like the others, and reintroduces some truly fantastic villains from history and myth, Medea and Caligula. Medea has her dragon-led chariot and magical powers and an overall bad rap (killing her whole family back in the day). Caligula has his power-hungry madness, his talking/scheming horse, and extravagance (in the form of a long chain of unbelievably opulent yachts here -- one dedicated solely to footwear). The heroes and poor Apollo in Lester's teen body ""with love handles"" face these foes again and again (maybe too many times) in one of the more action-packed books Rick Riordan has ever written.
With Riordan's usual knack for lightening the mood with lots of humor and quirkiness (like a talking arrow who speaks Shakespearean English and an aloe dryad who heals everyone with her goo), readers may forget that at the beginning of The Burning Maze, the author invokes Melpomene, the Muse of Tragedy. ""I hope you're pleased with yourself,"" the invocation reads. She must be, because things do turn tragic for a major character and the loss will be felt by fans.","Parents need to know that The Burning Maze is the third book in a series that's a spin-off of a Percy Jackson spin-off series. Did you follow that? The Percy Jackson and the Olympians series came first, then the Heroes of Olympus. It helps to read them both before digging into the Trials of Apollo series. The storyline picks up after the war at the end of the Heroes of Olympus, and many old favorite characters make cameos or are mentioned (yay, Piper!). And, for extra credit, reading the Apollo chapter in Percy Jackson's Greek Gods helps when our ""suddenly mortal and very unhappy about it"" narrator, Apollo, recounts key moments of his godly life. As in the first two books, there's a lot to learn about mythology nd history, this time about two infamous villains: Medea and Caligula, as well as Caligula's talking horse (seriously). Like the second book, The Dark Prophecy, this one has a  whole lot of action. No arena fighting, but Caligula orders hearts and tongues cut out. There are two sad and violent deaths with much mourning for one key character in the series. Main characters are injured in long fight sequences with automatons, explosives, fire-breathing dragons, fire-breathing apparitions, giant birds that cause paralyses, mini tornadoes, and big-eared incredibly skilled assassins called pandai.  Between the battles, expect lessons on dealing with loss, finding what home is, being yourself, wielding power with care, and not taking out anger on someone else.

Wolfie the Bunny,A fresh and funny take on new baby in the house.,"Little Dot's world is upset when her family comes home to find a baby wolf on their doorstep. Her parents are inexplicably smitten: ""He's adorable!"" ""He's ours!"" They not only take him in, they also document his every mundane accomplishment (eating!) with a panoply of cameras. When Wolfie grows to full wolf-size, they dress him in a pink zip-up bunny suit. Dot, however, isn't fooled. She tries to warn her parents: ""HE'S GOING TO EAT US ALL UP!"" But they're deaf to her cries nd blind to Wolfie's danger. Wolfie tags after Dot like an annoying younger brother, even accompanying her to the toilet. When she's forced to bring him along to the food co-op, a big, scary bear mistakes him for a succulent pink bunny. ""DINNER!"" he roars. Dot saves her brother by threatening to eat the bear, and together they walk home hand in hand.
","No dreary ""love your sibling"" message here; instead, kids will find it hilarious when Mama and Papa are completely blind to the danger posed by the arrival of little Wolfie. When Wolfie wolfs down his meals and drools all over Dot, Papa says, ""He's a good eater!"" The bunny family has a Portlandia-via-Brooklyn feel; Papa wears a hipster hat, and they shop at the crunchy Carrot Patch food co-op.
The detail in the art is as fun to read as the deadpan text: On high alert, Dot wears a headlamp to bed; the scary bear in the food co-op carries a basket full of honey in bear bottles. Text and art in WOLFIE THE BUNNY combine to make it  great family read.","Parents need to know that Wolfie the Bunny is a completely fresh take on the arrival of a new sibling. If kids see the new baby as a wolf in baby's clothing, they'll relate to little Dot, a bunny whose family comes home to their city stoop to discover a basket with a baby wolf. ""HE'S GOING TO EAT US ALL UP!"" she warns. But when Wolfie is threatened by a bear, Dot discovers her fierce inner older sister. There's some implied violence when Dot worries about Wolfie, including a picture of his menacing shadow while he's sleeping sweetly.

Boy Toy,Very mature book about boy molested by teacher.,"This book centers on a high school senior named Josh who, at only 12, was sexually abused by his attractive female history teacher. Through a long flashback, readers see how Eve slowly manipulates Josh into a sexual relationship, making him believe they really love each other.
Now Eve is getting out of jail, but Josh is still dealing with the trauma -- he's not only afraid to pursue girls, he also has bouts of violence and moments where he zones out uncontrollably. Additionally, Josh begins to worry that he will run into Eve in public.
","Better plotting and character development make this second book more intense, more disturbing, and ultimately more memorable than the first. Lyga again centers his novel on a messed-up teen boy protagonist and even sets the story at the same high school he created for his popular debut, The Astonishing Adventures of Fanboy and Goth Girl. Readers may be drawn in by a scintillating premise, but they will quickly feel sickened as Josh is easily and expertly manipulated by his teacher into a sexual relationship he is much too young for. They will find it easy to empathize with Josh, who even years later is traumatized by Eve's sexual molestation; Lyga carefully draws out Josh's flaws, from his violent tendencies to his fears of intimacy to his paranoia that everyone around him knows what has happened to him -- and that Eve could reappear at any moment.
There is no doubt that this is a mature book, from the subject matter to the language. But Lyga shows great respect for his audience and doesn't go the sensationalistic route. He writes in specific detail about Eve and Josh's sex life, but he also reveals Josh's vulnerability, presenting intimate conversations between Josh and his therapist, or between him and the girl who wants to be his girlfriend. This level of detail makes the story feel very real and makes Josh's pain very palpable.","Parents need to know that this book is about a boy who is molested by his teacher; Eve tricks Josh into believing they are in love even though he is only 12. Their sex life is graphically described, including depictions of oral sex and the watching of a pornographic film. Their relationship is discovered after Josh attacks a girl in a closet during a teen party. Josh is later beaten up by Eve's husband. The book also features language that is as mature as its subject matter.

"The Ghostfaces: Brotherband Chronicles, Book 6",Swashbuckling uncharted-island adventure has a few lulls.,"Hal and the crew of the Heron are all ready to sail for home after official business in Clonmel, but the weather has other ideas. A relentless, rough wind pulls them off course completely. When it's discovered that one of their water casks sprang a leak, the need to find land is urgent. Hal makes the tough decision to pull the ship well into the Endless Ocean in uncharted territory -- the ship just won't budge in any other direction. Just before the crew dies of thirst, they encounter an island. It seems uninhabited at first, but when Lydia goes hunting in the forest she spots fresh human footprints. Whoever is out there is wary of the brotherband -- almost as wary as the brotherband is of something else: giant scratch marks in the trees. They could only have been made by a massive bear, one that's sure to come sniffing around the new brotherband camp.  ","As reliable as Hal is as captain of the Heron, every book in the Brotherband Chronicles is a reliably good read, including this one. Here comes another high-seas, swashbuckling adventure, this time in the uncharted territory of the Endless Ocean fighting against a band of skull-painted pillagers -- well, eventually. It's not all swashbuckling. After a harrowing start where the crew almost dies of thirst, there's quite a lull as readers get acquainted with a new island and its inhabitants, friendly and not.
It stays friendly for some time, actually. There are banquets and the swapping of recipes, with an amiable village of locals. The dreaded Ghostfaces of the title take a very long time to arrive, making readers almost think the crew is getting off the island easy -- if you don't count a nasty encounter with a giant bear. As usual with the series, when the action ramps up and the axes and swords come out, there's quite a payoff. Unusual for the series, the very end takes on a somber tone.","Parents need to know that The Ghostfaces is the sixth book in the Brotherband Chronicles, the companion series to John Flanagan's popular Ranger's Apprentice series. After taking on malicious slave traders in Book 4 and a cult of assassins in Book 5, the crew of the Heron tackles a terrible storm that blows them so off course they almost die of thirst onboard. On an island somewhere in the Endless Ocean, they encounter and fight a giant bear and fight the Ghostfaces of the title, ruthless warriors painted up like skulls who pillage small villages and enslave or kill the inhabitants. Expect the usual battle scenes with arrows, axes, swords, darts, and the ship's signature giant crossbow, the Mangler. Less expected for the series are two sad deaths, one of which results in an intense period of mourning for one of the Heron crew. Lucky for him he has his brotherband friends to help him. In general, author John Flanagan puts much focus on all the good qualities of each member of the brotherband, restating them often as he shows them supporting one another, working together, or showing a particular skill.

Sold,Unforgettable story of Nepali girl sold into prostitution.,"SOLD is the story of 13-year-old Lakshmi, who lives in a tiny village in Nepal with her mother, baby brother, and stepfather. Lakshmi's family is poor, owing in part to her stepfather's gambling habit. But she goes to school, has a beloved pet goat, and imagines what her life will be like when she marries a local boy named Krishna. It's an innocent life, so innocent she can’t imagine what awaits her as she travels with her new ""Auntie"" and then ""Uncle Husband"" to a job in Calcutta. Instead of working as a maid and sending money home to her family, she finds herself trapped in a brothel with seemingly no way of escape.
","Chilling and heartbreaking, this award-winning novel's spare first-person account of a teen Nepali girl sold into prostitution is unforgettable. As it's written in free-verse vignettes (some only a few paragraphs) rather than chapters, readers are able to take an emotional breath between scenes they find disturbing. The book's many awards are well earned and an accurate reflection of this remarkable work. ","Parents need to know that Patricia McCormick's award-winning novel in verse, Sold, is the story of Lakshmi, a 13-year-old girl from a poor village in rural Nepal, who is sold into prostitution by her stepfather. Lakshmi, thinking she is going to a job as a housemaid, is innocent of what lies ahead until she arrives at Happiness House, a brothel in India. Held captive until she can pay off the ever-increasing debt owed by her family, she risks everything for a chance to escape. The storyline is intense and disturbing but never sensationalized.

A Helpful Alphabet of Friendly Objects: Poems,Poetry collection could become a kids' classic.,"Who can see the poetry in a vacuum cleaner and a shoelace? Pulitzer Prize-winning author John Updike, and he inspires his readers to see it too. His photographer son provides page after page of kid-centered images. This collection could easily become a childhood favorite.
 ","This book is a refreshing change from typical children's alphabet or poetry fare. It assumes what most kids already know: To get their attention, you've got to appeal to their imagination and creativity. Any book that likens an icicle to ""tiger teeth"" and describes a vacuum cleaner as ""the nosy old hummer"" that ""bump-rubs every corner / so every crumb / of dust and fuzz vanishes / into its hum"" definitely does just that -- and more.
In addition to the music of Updike's poetry, one read-aloud group loved the photos, abundant images of kids with familiar objects that inspired discussion about the listeners' own experiences. And the endpages, which got almost as much attention as the rest of the book, feature color-block squares with alternating alphabet letters and photos from the book's main pages.

Leave Me Alone!,Granny treks off to knit in peace in funny modern folktale.,"In LEAVE ME ALONE!, an old Russian woman lives in a small village in a small house overrun with very active grandkids. With winter coming, she knows she has ""some very important knitting to do"" but can't get started with all the kid chaos in the house. After straightening the house and enjoying a cup of tea from her samovar, she packs a sack and shouts, ""Leave me alone!"""" She heads up a mountain and tries to knit there but is interrupted by a bear family who wants to eat her nd a cave full of mountain goats who want to eat her yarn. At the top of the mountain, she manages to climb onto the moon, but even there, she's bothered by little green moon-men. Unexpectedly, she escapes through a wormhole, where she at last finds the peace and quiet she needs to knit 30 little sweaters -- which she then brings back to her 30 grandkids.
","A classic-sounding folktale takes an unexpected and funny space-age turn in this story that sends a Russian granny on a journey to the moon and beyond. Author-illustrator Vera Brosgol's debut picture book is highly inventive. Readers will enjoy the pitch-perfect folktale start nd howl at the humor. When the grandkids are ""very curious about her knitting,"" one girl stuffs a ball of yarn in her little brother's mouth: ""Could you make your brother eat it?"" Other kids wonder, ""Why did the ball get smaller and smaller as you chased it?""
Leave Me Alone! has a perfect balance of text and art. Mountain goats who are happy the old woman ""brought snacks"" are shown passed out in drunk-like stupors after gorging on yarn. And the little moon-men have scanners that say ""beep boop"" -- so fun to say! There's also storytelling know-how in the repeated chant. And though it looks a little odd to modern eyes to see all-white faces in such a huge mess of kids, it's a Russian village and family. When the old woman's ""important knitting"" turns out to be 30 sweaters for the very same grandkids who brought her to ""the end of her rope,"" the touch of sweetness is just right.","Parents need to know that 2017 Caldecott Honor book Leave Me Alone!  by Vera Bosgol is a fun, kid-pleasing trek with a cranky, sweater-knitting grandma. What's an old woman to do when her hordes of wildly active grandkids won't let her knit? She shouts, ""Leave me alone!"" and heads out in search of peace and quiet. Author-illustrator Brosgol was born in Moscow, and the book has the feel of a Russian folktale. The old woman hails from a quaint village where neighbors tend their gardens and goats.

The Angel and the Soldier Boy,Two toy dolls star in thrilling picture book.,"In this lively wordless picture book, two valiant toy dolls recapture a coin stolen by storybook pirates. THE ANGEL AND THE SOLDIER BOY demonstrates that loyalty and affection can inspire even little people to muster the courage to accomplish great things.
Told entirely in pictures, this tells of thieving miniature pirates from a little girl's bedtime storybook who come to life and steal her special coin. When the child's soldier doll demands that they return the treasure, the pirates take him prisoner aboard their ship. The soldier boy's friend, an angel doll, heroically journeys through the sleeping girl's house to rescue the soldier boy and retrieve the coin.
","This book is full of affectionate moments. The little girl's mother reads her a story and kisses her goodnight, and the girl falls asleep with her favorite dolls placed beside her. Later, one doll is distraught over the other's disappearance, and when she rescues him, he gallantly kisses her hand. The story closes reassuringly with the little girl clasping one of them in each fist, and all is once again right with the world.
To us giants, a child's world seems simple and sheltered. But for little ones, something as seemingly routine as the loss of a favorite coin can be traumatic, and a friend's steadfastness or betrayal can make or break a child's day. In THE ANGEL AND THE SOLDIER BOY, true friendship is put to the test.","Parents need to know that detailed and sweetly drawn illustrations make it easy for children to follow this wordless story.

Frankenstein,Classic of scientist haunted by his creation still timely.,"Rescued from an ice floe near the North Pole, a dying Victor Frankenstein tells a British explorer a remarkable tale of his blighted life: After an idyllic childhood as the eldest son of a wealthy Swiss family, he's sent to Ingolstadt to pursue his university studies, where his brilliance and thirst for knowledge soon become apparent. All his skill and energy are soon devoted to his obsessive quest to create life and bestow it on an inanimate being, which he constructs from multiple corpses after many experiments that horrify even him. When he succeeds in animating his creature, he is appalled by what he's done and hides from him; the creature disappears, and only gradually does it become apparent that in creating this being and then rejecting him, Frankenstein has brought about the doom of all those who are dear to him.
","From the hindsight of 200 years, there's much to mock in this book, and the prose can be a slog by today's standards. But the story and its philosophical issues are no less compelling today than they were when Mary Shelley wrote FRANKENSTEIN, as evidenced by the fact that they recur in so many books, movies, and TV plots to this day.","Parents need to know that the 1818 novel that launched dozens of Hollywood horror movies bears little resemblance to any of them, but is quite creepy enough, flowery prose and all, and, historically speaking, went a long way toward inspiring a genre in which things go very badly for many reels. It's also a mainstay of high school honors literature classes and a good intro to both Gothic literature and science fiction. Its themes of delving into the dark arts will have allure for the Twilight set, while the science project run amok (and the arrogance of its creators) is a subject that remains all too timely. Bigotry alert: One of the subplots involves noble Christian characters who risk all to save a Muslim friend from certain death, and once safe he betrays them to an evil fate.

Rudas: Niño's Horrendous Hermanitas,Niño tangles with his baby sisters in boisterous sequel.,"As RUDAS: NIÑO'S HORRENDOUS HERMANITAS opens, Niño is making a book using crayons and paper. But when his opponent El Extraterrestre arrives, Niño suits up to wrestle him only to stop short when his sisters, Las Hermanitas, are announced instead of him. The two baby girls are rudas who play dirty, and their first move is ""BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The Poopy Bomb Blowout!"" Other slick baby moves involve leaving a dirty diaper behind, biting the devil on his long red tail, and shouting ""Gimme!"" and ""¡Mio!"" ""Will anyone be spared from their Pampered Plunder?"" Not even Niño is safe as they poke at his eyes and bite his arm. When Niño does escape, they wail, and no one can make them stop until Niño returns to read them the book he was writing -- and the book's about them!
","In this bold, bright, and boisterous picture book sequel, a young boy who imagines he's a lucha libre wrestler is joined by his two baby sisters who are rudas, wrestlers who don't play by the rules. Rudas: Niñas Horrendous Hermanitas works as a sweet, funny sibling book, as well as an action-heavy superhero-type book complete with villains and speech balloons. It's loaded with humor and bursting with punchy comic book words like ""ARGGGWWGGG!"" The dirty moves employed by the rudas include ""The Poopy Bomb Blowout,"" and leaving a dirty diaper behind. ""¡Santa pañales!"" cries Niño -- translated as ""Holy diapers!"" There's lots of Spanish scattered through the text, so the book's ideal for bilingual kids. And it works beautifully as an introduction to Spanish language and Mexican culture.
Morales paints the wild baby rudas with such appealing faces that we can't help being charmed, as is Niño himself, and the last spread of the siblings cuddled up and reading is very sweet indeed.","Parents need to know that Rudas: Niñas Horrendous Hermanitas by Caldecort Honor author-illustrator Yuyi Morales (Viva Frida), is a sequel to Niño Wrestles the World, which featured a young boy imagining himself as a Mexican lucha libre wrestler. This one incorporates his baby sisters, who are rudas who play dirty, poking and pulling, as baby sisters will. The pages are fun and busy and action-packed, studded with creative comic book action words like MUARGGG! And Morales weaves in lots of Spanish, some of which is translated, and some of which is understandable to English speakers from context. While there's plenty of rambunctious horseplay and a few diaper jokes, Niño's a model older brother who enjoys his baby sisters nd reads to them to calm their crying.

Night Time Numbers: A Scary Counting Book,Nighttime book is more fun than fright.,"Parents and children can--literally--count on monsters growling, black cats snarling, and wolves howling in this charming story book. But rest assured, the story ends with the presence of angels all around, protecting young readers from nightmares, creatures under the bed, and all those other things that go bump in the night.
 ","This book successfully uses kids' ttraction to creepy things to tell an engaging bedtime tale -- and reinforce the concepts of counting and basic addition in the process. What child isn't fascinated by skeletons, spiders, and the other scary folk usually associated with Halloween? Once the ""nightmare monsters"" -- including bats, goblins, and witches -- are located and accounted for, the child (and yours) can rest, knowing that goodness (in the form of angels, and her mother) is all around, keeping the sleeping child safe from harm.
Although the multitextured collages can be a bit abstract, most children can easily identify (and, with help, count) the creatures from page to page. From the very first page (when the mother asks her child, ""What do you see in the backyard tonight?"") young children of all ages are enthralled.","Parents need to know that children will love the engaging story line, and even nonreaders will be eager to participate in the ""ghost hunt.""

"Villains Rising: The Cloak Society, Book 2",Slower-paced superhero sequel keeps violence in check.,"After Justice Tower burns to the ground at the end of The Cloak Society, former supervillains-in-training Alex, Mallory, and Misty lie low with young heroes Amp, Kyle, and Kirbie in a lakeside safe house in the Sterling City 'burbs. Gage, Alex's super-brilliant scientist friend, comes along, toting a precious half of the special weapon that transported the adult superheroes into an alternate plane known as the Gloom. The new, not-quite team starts training together, while Gage immediately gets to work in the lake house garage trying to repair the weapon and get the heroes back. But Gage soon realizes he can't make progress without the other half of the weapon. Thus, this new team-in-training's first mission: Go to Alex's former underground lair to retrieve it. Even if they sneak out of their safe house on a night they know the High Council will be gone, plenty of other villains are on the lookout for them including the young Beta team villains they left behind and the Omegas, a covert group of superspies whose superpowers and training Alex fears are far superior to theirs.
","VILLAINS RISING: THE CLOAK SOCIETY, BOOK 2 is one of those books that needs the old sports-movie cliche of a montage -- maybe a few of them. One for when Alex and team start training together. One for Gage in his workshop fixing the Gloom weapon, when he tests things on Alex and Amp and fails and everyone waits and bites fingernails. One for planning meetings with maps and snips of newscasts as the new team tries to plot their next move. One for preparing for their mission to the underground lair. Then we could get to the action faster and get to meeting those cool Omegas -- just when you think there aren't any superpowers left to think up, the author offers us a few more slick ones. (Well, maybe one derives from a Wonder Twin's ability to turn into water, but this is way, way cooler.)
	Fans of superhero tales should still be drawn in enough to find out what happens to Alex and friends in Book 2 and beyond -- they definitely have a lot stacked against them -- but don't expect a fast and thrilling read until near the end. It may be helpful to skim until you get there.","Parents need to know that Villains Rising: The Cloak Society, Book 2 is the second book in a superhero vs. supervillain series targeted at tweens. The first book, The Cloak Society, featured young supervillains realizing they picked the wrong side. Now they're hiding out with a small band of young superheroes and trying to form a team. Of course they have problems with whom to trust and how to work together. They also fight some villains using their various powers (one uses telekinesis to slam opponents into walls, and others use claws, metal fists, and gas bombs), but it never gets gory and no one dies.

The family camaraderie is endearing and kids will identify with Piper as she copes with a bossy older sister, an annoying little sister, troubles with friends, and being the new kid at school.
This is a great book for kids who have recently moved, are children of military parents, or will be starting a new school.

"Stephen Curry: Epic Athletes, Book 1",Breezy biography tracks the rise of an NBA superstar.,"Written by New York Times-bestselling author and Yahoo! Sports national columnist Dan Wetzel, STEPHEN CURRY, the first of the Epic Athletes series of sports biographies for young readers, traces the life and career of the baby-faced Golden State Warriors star from his days shooting jumpers in his driveway in Charlotte to the highest heights of professional basketball. The son of NBA veteran and three-point specialist Dell Curry (his mother Sonya was also a college varsity volleyball player), Steph grew up around the game and learned early on what it takes to perform at an elite level. Despite being short and slight of build for most of his youth, Steph developed an incredible work ethic and honed his ball skills and shooting by practicing constantly. Despite dominating as a high schooler, Curry wasn't recruited by big-time college basketball programs. Instead, he wound up at tiny Davidson College in North Carolina, where he led his team in an improbable run to the Elite Eight in the NCAA March Madness tournament and first attracted national attention. As the book underscores, Steph still had a lot to learn and to prove once he reached the NBA, but he wound up surpassing everyone's expectations, leading the Dubs to three championships in four years and shattering record after record. From the thrill of victory to the agony of defeat, Stephen Curry has navigated his meteoric ascent with grace, humility, and a deep reverence for the strength and support his family and faith have given him.
","Athletes and sports fans will appreciate this inside look at the development of one of the most exciting and skilled basketball players to emerge in this era. Even though this is very recent history, it's easy to forget just how unexpected and improbable Steph's explosion onto the NBA scene and the Golden State Warriors' coronation as a dynasty was. Wetzel's straightforward narration does a decent job of highlighting the major characteristics that have proven key to Curry's success, though Stephen Curry: Epic Athletes, Book 1 is light on personal details and stays safely at surface level. The story is an inspirational one, although one of the paradox's of Steph's career has always been his status as both an undersized underdog nd the privileged son of an NBA vet. Wetzel successfully threads the needle, making sure to emphasize the challenges Curry faced and overcame, the obstacles and letdowns he had to bounce back from, and the indescribable will to improve that made him the player and the man he is today. For younger fans who may have missed or forgotten Steph's early career, this bio serves as a solid introduction. The comic-style illustrations by Zeke Peña provide some visual excitement, while Wetzel's writing is smooth and effective. However, readers interested in learning more about Steph Curry's development and how his personality and personal life have factored into his success may want to turn to the stellar biography Golden: The Miraculous Rise of Steph Curry, by accomplished Warriors' insider and beat writer Marcus Thompson II. While that book is written for an adult audience, the famously wholesome and kid-friendly Curry's story is tame enough to be appropriate for young readers. ","Parents need to know that Stephen Curry: Epic Athletes, Book 1, by critically acclaimed sportswriter Dan Wetzel, is an easily digestible biography for young readers about one of the National Basketball Association's brightest stars. The book tracks the sharpshooting point guard's improbable rise from an undersized and lightly recruited high school prospect to a two-time MVP and three-time NBA champion.

"Caraval, Book 1",Sisters escape abusive father to play dangerous magic game.,"In CARAVAL, every year for her whole childhood, Scarlett has sent letters to Master Legend, asking him to come to her small island with his magic performers -- until one year she tells him not to come because she's getting married. Of course, that's the year she gets a letter back, with three tickets enclosed, one for her, one for her impetuous younger sister, Donatella, and one for the fiancé Scarlett has never met. Donatella is ecstatic about the news, and so is the handsome man Scarlett catches her with in the cellar, Julian. Julian has been to Caraval before and has an offer for them: He'll sneak them to the location -- Master Legend's famed private island, Isla de los Suenos -- in exchange for one of the tickets (the sisters have longed to escape their abusive father). Late at night Julian and Donatella drug Scarlett and drag her onto a boat. When she wakes, it's just her and Julian on a rowboat headed for the island, and Donatella's nowhere to be found. Quickly Scarlett discovers Donatella's been kidnapped and that Caraval is really a magical game, a dangerous one if Scarlett doesn't find her sister before the week is out.
","Don't let the magical island setting fool you -- there's nothing laid back about this absorbing tale that's part smoldering forbidden romance, part rescue mission. Yes, it's set on a fantasy island, one readers would probably love to linger on if first-time author Stephanie Garber would let them. Garber doesn't linger on the details of world building -- or even let the characters sit down for a meal (do they ever eat?). Still, the fast pace does have the advantage of keeping readers fully immersed in the mystery as much as the main character, Scarlett. What's real? Who are the performers and who are the other players? Why is Scarlett's sister the one kidnapped, the one tied to the prize? How much danger is she really in?
Caraval is a zip-through read once you hit the halfway point, with more than a few eye-opening surprises at the end.","Parents need to know that Stephanie Garber's Caraval is a fantasy-romance about two sisters running away from their abusive father to an enchanted island where, for one week, they're part of an immersive magical game. Readers will spend much time wondering what's real in the game, but a few deaths of characters close to the main character feel very real. Also, a character is slashed with a knife, and another is drugged and kidnapped and almost drowns. Other mature content includes some kissing and innuendo and a teen girl drinking to excess. Besides being an immersive fantasy, this story reminds readers of the courage it takes to stand up to an abuser and get out from under the abuser's power nd even the courage it takes to forge your own path.

Ghost Time,Daring and confusing story about love and time.,"Artistic, 15-year-old Thea is thrown into confusion when Cam, her math-genius boyfriend, disappears. From that moment, the story, narrated by Thea, alternates forward and backward in time. Cam's theory, that time is a code that can be hacked, appears to be coming true, as past events are shown to change and disjoin from the present. Thea's love for Cam grounds her sufficiently to hope for his return.
 ","With chapters alternating between past and present, some readers might like the reality-bending aspect of GHOST TIME;  others may find it confusing. The plot turns on whether artistic Thea will be reunited with her nerdy boyfriend, who disappears for reasons unknown.
The first in a trilogy, this installment leaves many mysteries unresolved and might lose some readers before the sequels appear. The story grows stronger as it reaches deeper into Thea's past, fraught with self-cutting, and the healing she achieves through the love of her first boyfriend.","Parents need to know that the convoluted plot of Ghost Time, a fantasy with a paranormal element, involves 15-year-old narrator-protagonist Thea being exposed to shame when she appears in sex videos that go viral on the Internet. She knows the incidents never actually happened (and they are not explicitly described), but the emotional charge of the story derives from episodes in which a feisty teen faces nightmares of confusion. Her rage and self-cutting after the breakup of her parents might make some young readers uneasy.

The English Roses,Madonna's first book has good message for grade-schoolers.,"Four British girls, all 11 years old, do everything together, including snubbing a beautiful, accomplished neighborhood girl named Binah whom they have never met and who makes them feel jealous. A fairy godmother offers the four the opportunity to see inside Binah's home, where they discover Binah's life is much harder than they would have expected.
","Well-known entertainer Madonna makes her debut as a children's book author with the first in a series of five entertaining books, each based on a different set of emotions. Now a mother herself, Madonna says that she was inspired by her Kabbalah teacher to share with children some of the insights that she gained in her Kabbalah work. Parents may find plotting about a fairy godmother and a lonely girl also seems like well-tread territory, but at least the girls acknowledge it (""'She reminds me of Cinderella,' said Amy""). Likewise, the message about inclusion is a fairly familiar one -- though it is age appropriate for the 6+ kids this book targets.   As illustrated by fashion designer Jeffrey Fulvimari, the characters are wide-eyed, skinny, and fashionably dressed -- a bit like Bratz dolls. Parents might object to their slouchy, skinny-body, big-eyed fashion-model look -- and it's certainly worth addressing -- but it is eye-catching art that works well with the often sassy narration (""Have you ever been green with envy?...If you say no, you are telling a big, fat fib and I am going to tell your mother."") Also, it may help early elementary kids making the transition from picture to chapter books feel like this is a book for THEM.   ","Parents need to know that this book deals with a group of friends who snub a beautiful girl because they are ""green with envy;"" ultimately they learn to have empathy for her, and include her.

She starts her journey in LA with a list of goals, including furnishing her apartment, getting back together with Alex, and making it in Hollywood. Becca must overcome grueling waitressing jobs to pay her rent, as well as constant rejection from agents while trying to pursue her passion and prove to herself -- and the rest of the world -- that she's good enough.

While Becca's initial plan seems naive, she eventually proves herself to be persistent, intelligent, and incredibly endearing. Though parts of the novel may seem unrealistic, Becca's charm and the quirky details incorporated into the plot turn this classic aspiring-actress-in-LA story into something unique and lovable. Teens will be able to relate to Becca's struggles with her appearance and with feeling undesired, as well as her paralyzing fear of failure and heartbreak. The novel includes big messages about love and deviating from a more traditional path, even though the ending is underdeveloped and a bit disappointing.

Ever since her father left the family two years ago, life is not the same for Kristi. Her ex-best friend Hildie can't stand her; Gusty -- Hildie's hot brother -- thinks that Kristi is \""sick,\"" and Kristi's mom is a surgeon workaholic. Listening to opera is about the only thing that saves Kristi from her own thoughts -- as well as the thoughts of others, for Kristi is a self-prescribed psychic. For Kristi, hearing the thoughts of others just means she knows all the nasty things that people think about her. When a school project pairs her with Gusty, she must explore her own greatest attributes and liabilities and then make a plan to improve her life.
","Kristi is not an easy character to like initially. She lies, ignores responsibility, plays mean tricks on strangers, and wallows in negativity. She is, however, a complex character, and eventually reveals an honest, smart, creative, hopeful, and vulnerable side. Kristi sees and then admits her own mistakes, and has the courage to make amends in this story that moves along at a good clip.
	Kristi's psychic abilities are an interesting feature here, especially because she trusts them so much. Readers will have their doubts about how psychic she really is -- and thankfully the story is not consumed by supernatural gimmicks. It's more of an edgy portrayal of teen girl many teen girls will relate to in some way.","Parents need to know that the main character, Kristi, is angry, isolated, intentionally cruel, and lies to her mother. There is much swearing and cynicism, some adult and teen drinking and smoking (a mother offers her daughter tequila), as well as crude sexual banter, but nothing much beyond that.

"Come Back, Amelia Bedelia",Amelia Bedelia's predicaments keep kids engaged.,"When Mrs. Rogers summons her maid, Amelia Bedelia, and requests cereal and coffee, Amelia complies literally by bringing her a cupful of both, which prompts her flustered employer to tell Amelia to go away. Amelia doesn't understand what she did wrong, but she does as she is told--and leaves the house.
She responds to a ""Help Wanted"" sign in a beauty-shop window, is hired, and is told to pin up a customer's hair. Much to the dismay of her employer and the patron, Amelia uses safety pins, and she is again told to go away.
Similar events unfold until she is finally instructed to go home, which, of course, she does. There, Mrs. Rogers apologizes and all is well again. The book ends as Mr. Rogers requests that she heat a can of soup. True to form, not having learned her lesson, Amelia begins heating the can.
","COME BACK, AMELIA BEDELIA combines humor with simple language principles to create an entertaining learning experience. Like other books in this series, there isn't much story, and the writing sometimes strains to stay within the limited vocabulary of an easy-reader. But children find it entertaining, and the simple writing style makes this a good choice for early readers.
Reading about Amelia Bedelia's constant struggles with words can be helpful for school-age children who have difficulty mastering reading and language concepts.

"Somebody, Please Tell Me Who I Am","Intimate, intense tale of soldier healing from brain injury.","Everyone expects high school senior Ben Bright to pursue his passion for theater in college, but he shocks his family and friends by enlisting in the Army Reserves. After he suffers a traumatic brain injury in Iraq, he is flown back to the States, where his parents, his autistic brother, his fiancee and his best friend all struggle to help him put back together the scattered pieces of his shattered identity.
","SOMEBODY, PLEASE TELL ME WHO I AM is a very intimate, intense chronicle of one young man's rehabilitation after a catastrophic war injury.

Short and to the point, Somebody, Please Tell Me... addresses its serious subject with truth and grace.","Parents need to know that Somebody, Please Tell Me Who I Am is a realistic depiction of one American soldier's rehabilitation from a traumatic brain injury in Iraq.

James and the Giant Peach,Lonely boy's magical adventure still satisfies.,"When young James Henry Trotter is orphaned, he must leave his pleasant home by the seaside and go to live with two cruel aunts, Sponge and Spiker, who treat him like a slave. One day, an old man appears, offering James a bag of crystals that he says will make marvelous things happen. The old man's magic causes a dead peach tree to grow a piece of fruit the size of a house, and that is the start of James' fantastic adventure.
","JAMES AND THE GIANT PEACH is a delightful children's novel full of adventure and singular characters. As in many of the great Roald Dahl's works, the central character is a poor, deprived child, and seeing James Henry Trotter rise from his lowly state to become a leader with true friends is immensely satisfying. Dahl also weaves funny singsong poetry into his fantastical tale, which helps make the book wonderful to read aloud.","Parents need to know that James and the Giant Peach creates a marvelous, fantastical world for young independent readers. Dahl's original cast of characters, magical and suspenseful situations, and his liberal addition of comic poetry also make this a terrific read-aloud book. However, Dahl's books are not always warm-and-fuzzy: James is orphaned on Page One, and he is treated cruelly by his selfish aunts. And, incidentally, his only true friends are giant insects. This is a charming, fast-paced fantasy for children who are ready to separate fact from fiction. If your kids enjoy the novel, also check out Tim Burton and Henry Selick's wonderful animated film adaptation, which came out in 1996.

The Four Dorothys,First book of teen series is just OK; some dark moments.,"Bryan prefers to be ""a supporting character or background player"" at his private school. But when someone begins sabotaging the four -- yes, four -- Dorothys cast in his school's production of Wizard of Oz, Bryan has to take more of lead role to get to the bottom of the mystery and save his best friend, one of the leads.
","This is pretty tame fare in comparison to the author's controversial novel about oral sex, Rainbow Party. Readers may like some of the clever details here: For Bryan's private school's production of Wizard of Oz, four students are cast in the lead role (that makes the rich parents happy); another scene has Bryan and his best friend Sam going to an outrageously large stuffed-animal emporium to pick out Totos for the show. But the pranks being pulled on the Dorothys seem dark in contrast to all the light, funny touches. Is the author trying for the dark comedy of the movie Heathers? This shift in tone makes it hard for readers to know how they should be feeling.
The book is pretty meandering, and the payoff isn't big enough. It's not really a mystery who is behind the crimes -- and readers may be disappointed that nothing really happens to the mean rich girl at the end -- at least, nothing hugely publicly humiliating. They also may be surprised that Bryan discusses his sexuality a bit but remains closeted. But perhaps that will be further developed in the next installment of the series. Yawn.","Parents need to know that this book features a gay protagonist (though he's still in the closet and doesn't pursue any romantic relationships). Parents should also know that some of the pranks that befall the Dorothys are pretty severe -- one star has an allergic reaction and needs a shot to stay alive, while another has naked pictures posted of her on the school's website. Parents may want to use this latter prank as a reason to review Common Sense Media's tips for being a good digital citizen.

"Nancy Clancy, Super Sleuth",Chapter book mystery promises more fun for Fancy Nancy fans.,"Inspired by the Nancy Drew mysteries she has been reading, Fancy Nancy is in search of a mystery to solve. Unfortunately, she sighs, there isn't much crime in her neighborhood. But when a special memento disappears from her classroom open house, she and her friend Bree get to work. Of course, Nancy isn't just an ordinary girl detective. She's just as fancy as she used to be (in her popular picture books), and she also still has a flair with words. Nancy and Bree find that tracking down the real culprit is a challenge, and the resulting discovery brings with it an important lesson about understanding and forgiveness.
","It's great to see Fancy Nancy growing up and still bursting with exuberance and individuality. NANCY CLANCY, SUPER SLEUTH keeps that spirit alive while developing a story that's perfect for kids getting into chapter books and looking for a little more challenge. Developing Nancy as a Nancy Drew-inspired ""super sleuth"" fills the bill, especially for kids who are looking for mystery stories aimed at younger readers.
This series promises to be the perfect next step for readers who want the Nancy Drew experience but aren't quite ready for it yet. Author Jane O'Connor shows she knows kids and captures their world ""superbly.""","Parents need to know that Nancy Clancy, Super Sleuth is the beginning of a new Fancy Nancy series, and Nancy has grown up just a little, right along with her fans. Kids ready for chapter books will enjoy Nancy's new adventures as a ""super sleuth.""

"A Dastardly Plot: A Perilous Journey of Danger & Mayhem, Book 1","Zany retro adventure tackles discrimination, evil schemes.","It's 1883 in New York. Molly and Emmett, a couple of poor but resourceful 12-year-olds, stumble upon A DASTARDLY PLOT -- though they're not sure whether it involves robots, death machines, or some other villainous doings. Also unknown, just exactly what inventors Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison have to do with this. It all has something to do with the upcoming New York World's Fair, which is a sore subject because Molly's inventor mom isn't allowed to show her work there. Things keep getting crazier, as a thick-accented Scottish crime lord and his henchmen, a society of women inventors, a mad scientist, nd a posse of singing robots get into the act.
","Christopher Healy launches a wild new series set in 1883 New York, with two resourceful 12-year-olds trying to save the world from wacky inventors. Or maybe help the inventors save the world. The orphan police, the immigration authorities, and two warring gangs of inept criminals add to the craziness, as do a society of (unsung) women inventors and the kids' other allies in foiling A Dastardly Plot. Not all readers will have the patience for all the looniness, with a side of social justice, but there are some great moments setting the stage for future plot developments.","Parents need to know that there's a lot to like in A Dastardly Plot, the first book in a new series by Christopher Healy (The Hero's Guide series). Set in an alternative 19th-century New York, it has quirky characters! Quirkier dialogue! Retro science fiction! Mad inventors! Applied science and emerging technology! Also a lot of history and culture, especially about discrimination against women and Chinese people at the time. There's a serious vibe beneath the cartoonish antics, with heavy subjects like the death of parents, imprisonment  in a mental asylum, and forced shock treatments being part of the story. It's wacky, poignant, and rousing by turns, which is a bit much to take in sometimes. The conclusion sets up what promises to be many adventures to come.

In Daddy's Arms I Am Tall: African Americans Celebrating Fathers,A joyous collection of poetry about fathers.,"This collection includes twelve poems from a variety of well-known African-American authors, including Angela Johnson, Sonia Sanchez, Carole Boston Weatherford, Davida Adedjouma, and David A. Anderson. The poems explore the dynamics of a father/child relationship and encompass a wide range of topics: ""In Daddy's Arms"" celebrates the confidence children derive from their fathers: other poems, such as ""Artist to Artist,"" focus on dreams deferred, and in ""Promises,"" a father vows his eternal love and devotion.
Each poem occupies a two-page spread. Several poems are printed on plain white backgrounds, with the accompanying illustrations set to the side or on the facing page. For other poems, the text is superimposed directly onto illustrations that fill the pages to the edges with color.
","This joyous collection of poetry is a testimony to the profound impact fathers have in shaping the lives of their children. Powerful and deeply moving, the poems resonate with a heartfelt and abiding respect for the stalwart men who play a vital role in nurturing their children's physical, spiritual, and emotional growth. The poems are perfect for read-aloud sessions.
Spectacular, vibrant collages capture the essence of the poems, distilled into evocative images wrought from mundane objects.

The Line Tender,Story of loss explores life in and out of the ocean.,"In THE LINE TENDER, almost-13-year-old Lucy Everhart feels compelled to finish the life's work that her deceased mother left behind. This work is about discovering the secrets behind the mysterious lives of sharks. The year is 1991-- before Google was a thing-- and the place is the seaport town of Rockport, Massachusetts. When a local fisherman named Sookie reels in a gargantuan white shark, Lucy and her friend Fred decide to investigate. But its disappearance and an ensuing tragedy pull Lucy deeper into the unfinished research that her marine biologist mother left behind. She gets Sookie, her injured father, and the grandfatherly neighbor to help her follow her mother's research, taking them to Maine and Cape Cod. All the while, Lucy looks at the grief that she carries in her body and her psyche, and finds a strength she didn't know she possessed.
","Nature plays a starring role in this story of stunning loss that's poignant, stark, and at times funny. In The Line Tender, Lucy Everhart carries  heavy load as a child who lost her mom at age 7 nd whose dad is rarely around to put food in the fridge. When a friend tragically dies, her obsession with her late-mother's research blossoms. She finds that she needs to make sense of her mom's life work in order to make sense of her own life. These things feel realistic.The description of life in a coastal town is vividly nd intimately described.
But, kids might notice that Lucy's voice is not always in tune with her age. She's 12, but she sometimes sounds like a 25-year-old graduate student. (""My body was starting to show signs of weight loss after only two weeks."")  Describing her mother in a video, she mentions ""watching her navigate a strange world so capably."" But then she describes the sound of the police radio as ""farty."" It makes Lucy seem  little random, as if she's not a fully fleshed-out character grounded in her age. But the setting and the action feel real, and readers who interested in marine life will get to know sharks nearly as well as the humans observing them.","Parents need to know that Kate Allen's The Line Tender deals with deaths of a parent and a peer. Underage drinking and consequent risky behavior result in a character's death. Some nonsexual adult nudity, adult drunkenness, and neglectful parenting take place. Lucy has trouble swallowing because of a traumatic event, and she loses a lot of weight as a consequence, An extremely graphic autopsy of a shark includes description of dead shark pups still in the mother shark's uterus. The mother shark's jaws are sawed out of her mouth: ""It was a bloody mess that turned all of the shark's white parts pink-orange."" A character then holds the ""dripping jaws"" in the air and has a photo taken. Though done in the name of biology, the dissection is graphic and could be jarring to sensitive readers.

Aggie and Ben: Three Stories,Humorous boy-and-his-dog tales for early readers.,"In three related short stories for beginning readers, Ben, after thinking about and rejecting several other types of pets, gets a new dog and names her Aggie. In the second story he learns to play with and relate to her, and in the last they face the scariness of a darkened bedroom together.
","The stories here ren't the most exciting ever written, but they're engrossing enough to keep a child reading, and they have flashes of humor and depth.
Writing books for beginning readers is tricky. The intellectual and interest levels of young readers usually exceed their reading abilities, and crafting a story that's interesting to them -- while sticking to a very strictly confined vocabulary set -- is a challenge few have mastered. What sets the book apart from others of this type are the illustrations and the way they work cleverly with the text. The pictures -- pen-and-ink with watercolor -- are humorously stylized and more sophisticated than those in most I-Can-Read books. They bear close and repeat viewings, as faces and bodies express ideas only hinted at by the text (the boredom of the pet shopkeeper, the father's reaction as his son considers a snake, etc.).","Parents need to know that there's nothing to be concerned about in these three short stories for early readers.

Under My Hijab,"Beautiful art, positive messages in headscarf story.","In UNDER MY HIJAB, an unnamed girl tells about various women in her life that wear hijab, the colored headscarves many Muslim women choose to wear. The women are seen first in public scenarios in hijab and then in more private spaces without hijab. A funky artist aunt piles her hijab high on her head and secures it with a handmade jewel, but at her colorful apartment, the narrator admires her aunt's pink and purple streaked hair like ""a fine work of art she can comb."" There's also her baker grandmother, doctor mother, a karate champion cousin, a fashionable sister, and a scary-story-telling troop leader. The girl chooses to practice wearing a hijab, too, at the end of the story, inspired by all the amazing women in her life. An end note explains more about the practice of wearing hijab.
","This lushly illustrated and rhythmically told tale informs about and reflects the richness of experience among Muslim women. Though Under My Hijab is about the headscarf, it is also about the full humanity of those who choose to wear it. In artfully revealing the personalities of each woman, in public and private, the wearing of hijab is demystified, and we see women with a full range of experiences, occupations, and expressions of self. Kids will love especially the quirky artist aunt with color-dyed hair and the wooden-block-breaking cousin who also dances wildly in the living room.
There's much common ground here between story and reader. The simple rhyming text can feel a bit forced, at times, but overall is quite enjoyable. The colorful and lifelike illustrations are as straightforward as the text and ably communicate the messages of diversity and strength that make this book a winner for any family or school bookshelf.","Parents need to know that Under My Hijab,  a picture book by Hena Khan (Amina's Voice nd More to the Story) nd illustrated by Aaliya Jaleel (Muslim Girls Rise), is about a girl's admiration for the women in her life. It shows each woman in and out of her uniquely styled hijab, or headscarf. Positive messages include having pride in family, culture, and faith and finding inspiration to succeed from the role models in your life. The girl's family and friends are creative, intelligent, and successful, as well as multi-racial. The grandmother and father appear black, the mother, aunt, and sister have various shades of brown skin, and the troop leader has pale skin and blond hair. The variety of ages, body shapes, occupations, and interests, means that young readers of any background will be able to find similarities with several of the female role models represented.

A Piece of Cake,Clever friendship story models creative problem solving.,"A PIECE OF CAKE is a clever take on a classic story structure in which a character sets out on a journey and meets various challenges along the way. Mouse bakes a cake for his friend's birthday, but, when he goes to deliver it, he gets waylaid by a string of friends asking for pieces. Because Mouse is ""a very kind mouse,"" he trades pieces of the cake for a succession of very odd items offered him: a cork, a piece of wire. So when Mouse gets to his friend Little Bird's house, he has no cake and nothing of value to offer. But Little Bird has a clever and creative solution. The two retrace the route, trading the odd items back for ingredients to make another cake. As with the title of the story, the solution turns out to be ""a piece of cake."" And everyone's invited to the party!
","The art in A Piece of Cake is completely kid-friendly and charming, and the story's all the more fun because it upends expectation. As Mouse meets up with the various animals who ask for a piece of his cake, author-illustrator LeUyen Pham never takes the obvious route. Mouse doesn't ask Cow for milk or Bear for honey, though we see they have plenty in store. Instead, each of the animals along the way offers to trade something unusual and seemingly worthless. Their eventual suggestions for trades to get what's needed to make a cake illustrate their ingenuity: They suggest that the wire can be used to blow soap bubbles and the flyswatter to catapult nuts up into a tree.
There's welcome predictability in the structure of the story -- a journey past various challenges -- but sly, fun unpredictability in the solutions suggested by the protagonists. Which makes the story perfect for young readers.","Parents need to know that A Piece of Cake is a clever friendship story written and illustrated by veteran illustrator LeUyen Pham (Freckleface Strawberry). Mouse makes a cake for his friend's birthday, but, on the way to deliver it, various friends ask for a piece, trading him seemingly useless items for it. So by the time he reaches his friend Little Bird, the cake is all gone. Little Bird and Mouse retrace his steps and figure out a way to get the items they need to bake a new cake. The art has an old-fashioned storybook charm, and the animal friends have the rounded, friendly appeal of characters in classic cartoons. No surprise, since Pham has worked as an animator.
