"Uglies: Uglies Quartet, Book 1",Thoughtful sci-fi about the price of beauty.,"Tally has grown up in a postapocalyptic world where, at age 16, everyone is given an operation that makes their faces and bodies perfect. Before the operation they are known as ""uglies"" and after as ""pretties."" After the operation they live in New Pretty Town, enjoying a life of constant partying and pleasure. Tally can't wait. Shortly before her 16th birthday she befriends Shay, who tells her about the Smoke, a secret community of those who refuse the operation. When Shay runs away to join the Smoke, Tally is given a choice by the Specials, the secret police: Help them find the Smoke and betray her friend, or remain an ugly forever.
","Author Scott Westerfeld manages a delicate balancing act in UGLIES. It's obvious that he had a point to make when he decided to write a book about a futuristic society that celebrates beauty above all else -- and that the world of the book is a not-so-logical extension of certain trends in today's society having to do with physical attractiveness, plastic surgery, mindless consumerism and pleasure-seeking, and divorce from nature. But he never hits the reader over the head with a message and, in fact, allows the lives of the pretties enough appeal to make the argument two-sided.
This intellectual argument is set inside a crackling, though at times maddeningly predictable, story. About two-thirds of the way through the book is a series of events that alert readers will have seen coming a hundred pages earlier, and they'll be frustrated that Tally so stupidly falls into these circumstances. But the final third is a breathtaking race to the cliffhanger ending.","Parents need to know that Scott Westerfeld's Uglies is set in the future and deals with our culture's obsession with physical perfection and hedonism. There's some fighting and a minor character is killed, not seen. A gruesome operation is described. Girl characters especially are brave and stand up to an oppressive regime.

The Courage of Cat Campbell,"Appealing tale of would-be witch has laughs, insights.","Ever since she was a baby, Cat Campbell desperately hoped she'd inherit her mother's magic gene. Her mother, Poppy, desperately hopes she didn't; Poppy hated magic, doesn't want it in her life, and hopes Cat will follow her path in the family bakery. By the time Cat turns 11, she hasn't shown a bit of magical talent, so she's all but lost hope of joining the glamorous, broomstick-riding young witches-in-training at Ruthersfield Academy. After some surprising events reveal that she does in fact have magical powers, she has a new sense of destiny. Unfortunately, Poppy is set against Cat's planned career -- and it's true that Cat's spells have a way of causing trouble. Which the town doesn't really need at the moment, as a long-imprisoned witch who once destroyed half of Italy is on the loose and bent on revenge.
","Kids determined to pursue a dream and getting a lot of discouragement will relate to Cat's plight as she faces one obstacle after another in her quest for a career in magic. Along the way, there are plenty of ""be careful what you wish for"" moments, as well-meant attempts at witchcraft cause scenes straight out of The Sorcerer's Apprentice -- which will be hysterically funny to some readers and a bit scary to others. There's a strong message, reinforced in various subplots, about why it's important to pursue your dreams nd how nothing but harm will come of giving it up. (Young bakers also will love the recipes at the back of the book, which conveniently include substitutes for magic ingredients.)
As the central characters, Cat and her mom, Poppy (the subject of author Lowe's first book, The Power of Poppy Pendle), are appealing and complex enough to be interesting -- especially as one revelation follows another. Some of the supporting cast are a bit more cartoonish, often serving to advance the plot or add atmosphere. The story offers some interesting discussion points -- not only about pursuing your dreams but about how to handle it when things don't go your way. ","Parents need to know that The Courage of Cat Campbell is an appealing tale of a late-blooming 11-year-old witch. Sensitive kids may be alarmed by some of the magic gone awry, especially when people are turned to stone, or maybe guinea pigs, but there's no real harm done, and it's often Mom (featured as a child in 2012's The Power of Poppy Pendle) who comes to the rescue. Author Natasha Lowe stresses the importance of following your destiny/bliss but also the need for balancing your passion with skill, discipline, empathy, and kindness. Many kids will relate to Cat's frustration when adults and circumstances keep her from her goals; they'll also relate to some of the problems that result.

"The Indigo Spell: Bloodlines, Book 3","Third Bloodlines adventure takes a romantic, magical turn.","At the end of The Golden Lily, Alchemist prodigy Sydney Sage and Moroi vampire Adrian Ivashkov finally gave into their feelings for each other in one climactic kiss. INDIGO SPELL explores the aftermath of the ""monumental kiss"": Sydney knows that a future with Adrian is forbidden, but the more she resists, the more she realizes how much and how often she needs him. Convinced at first that what she feels is lust and not love, Sydney throws herself into investigating Marcus Finch, a rebel ex-Alchemist on the run from the organization. As she deals with the secrets Marcus reveals about the Alchemists, Sydney must also contend with a dangerous witch who might be targeting her.
","Readers patiently waiting for the Sydney and Adrian relationship to finally move forward are duly rewarded with the most romantic installment in the Bloodlines series to date. The charming, artistic Adrian is everpresent in the story, and he perfectly balances Sydney's high-strung, type-A tendencies. That said, Mead's focus on the star-crossed lovers comes at the expense of secondary characters Jill, Angeline, Eddie, and Trey; there's considerably less about them here than in the first two novels, but it's clear they will feature more prominently in upcoming stories.
Although there's action and intrigue -- particularly about the former Alchemists who want to ""break"" the ceremonial tattoo that bonds them to the order -- this book is mostly about Sydney's character development. An Alchemist trained to regard vampires with a healthy dose of revulsion, Sydney knows that her blossoming and at times overwhelming feelings for Adrian go against everything she's been taught -- as does her newfound proficiency with magic. Faced with so many life-altering decisions, Sydney is a compelling protagonist you can't help but root for, even when she's exasperating. Mead is an author who knows how to keep you interested in her universe of characters, and it's already obvious the fourth book will be a game-changer.","Parents need to know that Indigo Spell is the third installment in Richelle Mead's best-selling Bloodlines series. After building up the chemistry between protagonist Sydney Sage and her vampire love interest, Adrian, Mead lets the spark fly, and romance takes the spotlight. There are several passionate kissing scenes and two all-out makeout sessions. The language is pretty mild compared with other teen books, but there are a few instances of ""s--t"" and ""a--hole."" So far, this is the series' least violent novel; there's suspense, action, and a magic-based fight, but no one actually dies. This series continues to explore issues of discrimination, questioning authority, and finding true love.

Love & Gelato,Teen grapples with grief and first love in charming romance.,"When 17-year-old Lina loses her mom to cancer, she honors her mom's dying wish that she spend a summer, and maybe longer, in Tuscany. Lina travels halfway around the world to meet and stay with her mother's friend, Howard, who is the caretaker of an American WWII cemetery just outside Florence. The catch? Howard may or may not be her father. As LOVE & GELATO unfolds, Lina reads a journal her mother kept during her time Florence. She sees her mother in a new light, reading about her excitement over studying in Italy, making new friends, falling in love, enduring heartbreak, and making life-changing decisions. As Lina gets to know her mom better, she must deal with the grief welling up inside her. Lina's own romantic life and choices are central to the story, as her mom's journal serves as motherly advice and a cautionary tale.
","This light, fun, fast-paced romance is a charmer. While still processing her grief over her mother's death, Lina Emerson is sent to Italy to live with an old friend of her mother's for the summer. In her first few weeks in Tuscany, she learns a lot about herself, her mother, and love. Author Jenna Evans Welch has a good ear for teen dialogue, and it's easy to fall into Lina's relationships and feelings. When Lina is handed her mother's journal from her time as a student in Florence, the story picks up. The reader gets to know Lina's mom's backstory as Lina herself is learning it. It tugs at the heart watching her slowly feel the depth of her sadness over her mom's death.
The mystery over who Lina's real father is is well written and adds a suspenseful element to the book. Lina's romantic struggles are cute and not too intense or heavy. In fact, the characters and romantic relationships could have had more depth and explanation. It's hard to believe that so much can happen to a person in a couple of weeks, but sometimes it's fun to suspend disbelief and go with it. Love & Gelato is a good choice for teens who like escapist romance but not the super-sexual stuff. Tuscany, and Florence in particular, provide a beautiful landscape for the action.","Parents need to know that Love & Gelato is a combination romance and coming-of-age novel set in and around Florence, Italy. Though the book's a light, fun read, it deals with a teen, Lina, who has lost her mother to cancer and is trying to figure out who her real father is. When she moves to Italy from Seattle, Lina doesn't even know the man she's sent to live with. Within a few weeks, she has made friends, had romantic ups and downs, and has read her mom's most intimate secrets from her time in Florence. The story is fast-paced and deals in a bit of wish fulfillment (characters live in Tuscan villas, throw big parties, and so on). There's no swearing and very little smoking, drinking, and violence in the book. Characters kiss but only a few times, and it isn't sexually charged. Most of the characters are good, supportive people.

The Water Horse,Another sweet animal tale from Babe author.,"When Kirstie finds what appears to be an unusually large fish egg on the beach below her house, she takes it home and pops it in the bathtub. When a strange creature emerges from it, she and Angus feed it sardines. Their grandfather, Grumble, recognizes it as a mythical Water Horse, and they name it Crusoe.
To get it out of the tub, they put it in a goldfish pond. Soon, though, it grows too large, and the pond is in danger of freezing, so they move it to a nearby lochan. But as he continues to grow at an alarming rate they face another problem -- how to keep the friendly beast, who associates humans with food and companionship, hidden. And where can they take him next?
","Dick King-Smith's specialty is gentle, fairly easy-to-read animal stories, and this one, though it's about a mythical creature, follows his tried-and-true formula. Though it lacks most of the elements most authors seem to think are necessary -- a villain, suspense, breathtaking drama, potty humor, nasty or heroic kids, ineffectual adults -- it's as pleasurable and satisfying in its calm, reassuring way as a cold evening in front of a warm fire.
There's something so reassuring about a writer who can make a story this delightful and fun without all the bells and whistles. Just a little light humor, likable characters, an engrossing setup, a little authorial magic, and presto -- a satisfying read.","Parents need to know that aside from the Water Horse eating a swan, there is little to be concerned about here.

I Am a Genius of Unspeakable Evil and I Want to Be Your Class President,Daily Show producer delivers pranks and yuks.,"Oliver is a 12-year-old genius and one of the richest people in the world. He lives undercover as a below-average student with his air-headed, coddling mother and self-involved father. When he's still a baby, Oliver sees that his father will only love him if he's intelligent. He doesn't want his intellect to be the feather in his father's filial cap, so he pretends to be dim and ridiculous. When his father fondly reminisces about his own election to the office of class president, Oliver decides to rob his father of his good memories by showing him that any idiot can become class president. Oliver proceeds to use intimidation, money, and blackmail in order to try to win the election.
","I AM A GENIUS OF UNSPEAKABLE EVIL AND I WANT TO BE YOUR CLASS PRESIDENT is funny and outlandish. Kids will love the dynamics of Oliver's double life as a tough, successful billionaire and a chubby, hapless dimwit. At the heart of it, Oliver just wants his father's love, but on his own terms, not as a reward for his supreme intelligence.","Parents need to know that they'll find lots of pranks against students and teachers in this book, as well as plenty of sarcastic quips and negative words for others. But that's the brand of humor in this first kids book by one of the Daily Show executive producers, and in the end the book and the evil genius-main character show some heart.

"Will Grayson, Will Grayson","Edgy, clever gay-themed tale about teens with same name.","WILL GRAYSON, WILL GRAYSON has a fun premise: Two narrators, each named WIll Grayson, tell their stories in alternating chapters. Will Grayson No. 1 is a straight, moody teen who's best friends with a large -- and larger than life -- out-and-proud teen named Tiny Cooper. Will Grayson No. 2 is an even moodier, lonely gay teen who first crosses paths with Will No. 1 in a porn store. From there, both Wills orbit around Planet Tiny. Meanwhile, heartbroken Tiny uses his pain to write, direct, and star in a fabulous high school musical titled Tiny Dancer, which wows everyone. But he's not the only one who makes a successful journey: Both Wills also find themselves, with a whole lot of help from their friends.
","This book offers lots of humor, lots of music, and fantastic over-the-top moments that we all can only wish would happen in real life. Some of the story is related in IMs and texts, which adds realism and energy. This is the first gay-themed book to wind up on The New York Times children's best seller list, and it's easy to see why.
Readers will certainly get caught up in the book's fun premise -- and even find themselves moved by this clever collaboration about coming-of-age in a gay-friendly big city. Tiny Cooper is a great character; his heart of gold -- and his amazing performance -- are truly unforgettable. Plus, who doesn't love a happy ending? Even if it's not exactly believable...","Parents need to know that this is the first gay-themed YA novel to wind up on The New York Times best-seller list. It features a gay-friendly school and town and gay characters, including a very out-and-proud character nicknamed Tiny Cooper. Tiny breaks stereotypes by being both overweight and capable of having a love life. Another character, one of the Wills, is taking medication for his depression, a depiction that's handled compassionately. Parental relationships are idealized but heartwarming. While nothing more than kissing happens physically, there's lots of graphic sexual language, and one scene is set in a porn store. The book includes other strong language as well, which might make this book a better fit for older teens.

Along for the Ride,Teen grows beyond dysfunctional family in romantic outing.,"Gifted but lonely teen Auden tries to recreate a childhood lost to a dysfunctional family by hanging out with other teens at the beach before they all head off to college in the fall. Her new gang is into BMX, but also into partying. She makes her first real friends, falls in love, and discovers girls/women can be feminine and smart, all for the first time. She also manages to overcome very bad parenting, and forges new relationships with her dysfunctional mother, her absent father, and her new stepmother.
","ALONG FOR THE RIDE has a pretty PG romance, lessons about self-acceptance and accepting others, and asks if people can change. Too many subplots slow things down a bit, and teen readers may lose interest in the stepmom/new baby storyline. But they'll stay hooked as Dessen once again explores themes of abusive parents, the power of friendship, and teens who run away from their problems.","Parents need to know that Along for the Ride offers a realistic portrayal of teen life that includes drinking, romance, and some non-graphic sex. Although these teens are just out of high school, there's a lot of beer drinking done by all. Main character Auden's parents divorce after much fighting; her mother is notorious for drinking and seducing her grad students. But all of the female characters are very intelligent, and there's an underlying theme that people can change for the better.

"The Secret Commonwealth: The Book of Dust, Book 2",Deeply philosophical fantasy for mature teens and adults.,"In THE SECRET COMMONWEALTH, Lyra's daemon, Pan, goes out alone late one night and witnesses a murder. The dying man's daemon gives Pan his wallet with a key to a locker. When Lyra goes to the police station to turn it in, Pan recognizes one of the murderers as a police officer and they make a hasty retreat. So Lyra goes to the locker herself and retrieves a backpack from the locker. In it, there are botany notes about roses, a poem in Tajik, a journal about the man's travels to a secret factory, and the names and addresses of contacts all over Europe and the Silk Road. Slowly Lyra and the spies she shares the backpack with (including her very old friend Malcolm) piece together a connection between the murder and the desire of those from the clergy to acquire this information. At the same time, Lyra and Pan are constantly fighting, and late one night Pan leaves her. He says he's going out to look for her imagination. Lyra is despondent and flees Cambridge before the loss is noticed (only witches are fit to be seen without daemons). As she attempts to follow Pan, her travels across Europe also lead her closer to the mystery of the roses and the lost city where separated daemons go.
","Like Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials series, this fantasy's mystical travel adventures and deeply philosophical themes combine for a brilliant storytelling experience for both teen and adult. Pullman himself has said he writes for both audiences at once. With Lyra at age 20 as the most important character, there are moments of rebellion and questioning and deep dissatisfaction with early adulthood that teens will relate to. Her loneliness in the world is palpable. When the story shifts to 31-year-old Malcolm, his fellow spies, refugees on boats, and the power-hungry clergy, adult readers will notice echoes of our current struggles in the world and Pullman's astute take on it all. At one point a conniving politician with closer ties to Lyra than she realizes waxes on about how to hide information. ""We should delicately and subtly undermine the idea that truth and facts are possible in the first place. Once the people have become doubtful about the truth of anything, all kinds of things will be open to us.""
As this book is sandwiched in the middle of the trilogy, its job is to build in conflict that drives the finale, and it does this well on many fronts. By the end of The Secret Commonwealth, the spies are adrift, innocents are arrested, the clergy is gaining power all over Europe, Lyra's enemies are many and waiting to pounce, and we know the significance of the roses and how hard it will be to reach them before the enemy does. Very little is resolved here and, after the last 30 pages, there's more worry for Lyra than ever before. This is one finale that will be very hard to wait for.","Parents need to know that The Secret Commonwealth is the second book in The Book of Dust trilogy and takes place, chronologically, nearly 20 years after the first Book of Dust, Belle Savage, and some seven years after the His Dark Materials trilogy. Lyra is a university student who must flee Cambridge suddenly and head to the Silk Road alone. Malcolm, a friend from the first book and now a spy, attempts to follow her. Expect more danger and death here than in the first Book of Dust. There's a gang sexual assault with details and injuries. Deaths occur frequently in various ways: assassination with swords (beheading too), the drowning of refugees, fire, bludgeoning, falling to death from exploded airship, and a shooting at close range with gun. People are imprisoned and interrogated -- and use the ""f--k"" frequently when this happens. Other mature content includes lots of smoking by less important characters and lots of drinking by everyone. Plus there are mentions of sexual relationships, straight and LGBTQ. The His Dark Materials trilogy was often banned or challenged from 2000-2009. Neither that series nor this one look kindly on the power-hungry religious order and none of the religious characters are ever the good guys. Readers can decide whether Philip Pullman's books promote atheism, as the ban attested, or accountability for those seeking power in religious offices. Or they can focus on The Secret Commonwealth's more intimate story of Lyra. She loses her imagination and tries to find that deeper connection to humanity again through the fables and stories people tell.

Tuttle's Red Barn,Family farm story will cultivate love of history.,"For more than four centuries, 12 generations of the Tuttle family have kept their family farm alive and productive. Each 2-4 page spread tells the story of each generation, and focuses on ways they were affected by changes in America, and how they adapted their lives to those changes.
","Young readers will be drawn in by the simple, straightforward, informative prose, especially since it's told from the viewpoint of each of the 12 boys that grew up to take over the farm. Together with colorful and unique woodcut prints whose style changes with each new era, that voice brings to life important events that shaped our country's history. And the experiences of each generation provide a perfect jumping-off spot for further study about early settlers, the American Revolution, Underground Railroad, the Industrial Revolution, and so on.
Today, the red barn on Tuttle's farm is a thriving roadside market with an adjacent nursery that is a favorite stopping off point for customers seeking fresh fruits and vegetables. But it started out as a wild stretch of land that John Tuttle cleared and plowed shortly after having been stranded along the east coast in the 1600s. From very humble beginnings, the farm, and those that tended it, grew and changed as one generation after another worked to make it successful. Amazingly, the farm stayed in the Tuttle family and now has the distinction of being ""the oldest continuing family farm in America.""","Parents need to know that, as this story follows the Tuttle farm through 12 generations, it traces the development of the United States from the days of the early settler to the present time.

See You in the Cosmos,"Sweet, quirky road story sparkles with warmth and wisdom.","In SEE YOU IN THE COSMOS, 11-year-old Alex (he's 13 ""in responsibility years"") sets off from his Colorado home for a rocket festival in New Mexico, accompanied by his dog, named after astronomer Carl Sagan. Alex is narrating his trip on an iPod he plans to launch, much like Sagan sent his Golden Record into space. His adventure takes unexpected turns, but he makes new friends -- including a man who's taken a vow of silence and his hotheaded roommate, a relative Alex never knew existed, and fellow rocket enthusiasts -- who help him along. Alex detours to Las Vegas to investigate a mystery involving his father, whom he thought was dead. By the time he returns home, his understanding of his family -- and love, bravery, and truth -- is forever changed.
","In his debut novel for young readers, Jack Cheng makes smart use of technology -- audio recordings on an iPod -- to heighten the emotional drama of his absorbing, irresistible road trip story. See You in the Cosmos is a transcript of Alex recording his story as it happens, with some assists from his travel companions. The technique very effectively plays up Alex's charming frankness, naïveté, and vulnerability, offering just enough hints of the bigger picture to keep readers turning the pages in suspense. Alex is a likable, independent boy intent on finding the positive in almost any situation. His stubborn optimism is irresistible and inspiring
There are strong themes about family, bravery, and responsibility -- though families should talk about the wisdom of Alex's attempted solo adventure.","Parents need to know that See You in the Cosmos -- the first young adult novel by Jack Cheng -- is told through transcripts of recordings by 11-year-old Alex, a bright, resilient Filipino-American boy who travels alone with his dog from Colorado to New Mexico. Alex befriends several adults who help him extend his trip to Las Vegas and then Los Angeles as he discovers information about his late father. The novel deals with messy family history including infidelity, mental illness, emotional abuse, and neglect. There's also a lot of science and history: Alex is recording diary entries on a ""Golden iPod"" he hopes to send into space just like his hero, Carl Sagan, sent the Voyager Golden Records in 1977. Inspired by Sagan (recording n EEG meant to be the sound of someone falling in love), Alex talks about wanting to record same-sex couples or people French-kissing. The adults he encounters expose him to some mature settings, including drinking, fighting, relationship drama, and an adult club. Alex also finds out what a menstrual period is, though it isn't detailed. There's discussion of a parent's illness and death, and a child is seriously hurt in an accident.

Some get at kids' emotions: anger, jealousy, sibling rivalry. Some offer advice, such as in ""Shower Songs"": ""If you ever sing / in the shower, / sing with your head / pointed down. / For it's true, / dontcha know, / it's a bad way to go... / to sing in the shower and drown.""

"The Wrath & the Dawn, Book 1","Hint of magic in absorbing 1,001 Nights-themed love story.","In THE WRATH & THE DAWN, against the wishes of her family and her first love, Tariq, Shahrzad sneaks away to marry the caliph and exact her revenge against him. He's a monster who killed her best friend and dozens more girls the day after they married him. While Shahrzad works out the caliph's weaknesses, she needs a plan to stay alive. She decides to tell him a continuous string of stories that will keep the caliph engaged through the wedding night and for many more. As she planned, the story of a thief with a genie lamp intrigues her new husband -- but not as much as Shahrzad's confident and assertive nature does. He orders the guards to stand down and lets her live another day, and then another. It's time she uses to sleuth around the palace. Her new husband is an accomplished swordsman and smarter and more astute than she expected. He's also more vulnerable and even more likeable than she expected, and he's full of secrets Shahrzad wants to uncover more and more just to understand him than for revenge. As Shahrzad begins to waiver in her murderous convictions, Tariq arrives at the palace in an entourage of emirs determined to help Shahrzad kill the caliph. It forces Shahrzad to decide whose side she's on.
","With ""1001 Nights"" as the inspiration, this magic-tinged tale only had to be a little melodramatic and escapist to draw in the romance fans, but it's so much better than that. Shahrzad is a fabulous character full of strength and brave intentions. She's very believable as a survivor and someone who would seek out the kind of trouble she's in. The caliph's secrets and the softening of Shahrzad's heart also roll out in a steady and believable way. First-time author Renee Ahdieh has a knack for good story pacing and well-placed character reflection. It's pretty hard to take a character from seething hatred to love in a few hundred pages without the readers scratching their heads a little. Ahdieh manages this challenge well.
The story stays so focused on the romance, though, that the subplots lack some depth. Shahrzad's father flits in and out of the story as a mystery figure more than the force he ends up to be. And Tariq's side of the story is more banter with his friend Rahim than true understanding of who he is beyond a handsome guy with good archery skills. These are mere quibbles in an otherwise big success for a first-time author. From the looks of The Wrath & the Dawn, readers have much to look forward to from Ahdieh.","Parents need to know that The Wrath & the Dawn is the first of a two-book series that combines elements of the ""1001 Nights"" (or ""Arabian Nights"") within a fantasy love story. Here the caliph's bride and storyteller is Shahrzad not Scheherazade. She manages to survive when dozens of girls have already been hung at dawn, but is almost hung. There are animal sacrifices for magic and fights with swords and arrows that kill and injure with some talk of blood spewed. A man drags his own throat across a blade to avoid being captured alive or made to talk. Sadness in characters' pasts include the fact that the caliph's mother was killed in front of him when he was 6 after she was accused of adultery,  pregnancy loss, and a hanging suicide. The caliph and Shahrzad have sex with some description of kisses and clothes removed. The worst the language gets is ""bastard son of a whore."" Readers will like Shahrzad. She's a strong female character who makes a huge transformation from a place of hatred and revenge to empathy and love.

Don Quixote,Art and emotion both lost in retelling of classic.,"An old Spanish man in the 1500s becomes obsessed with books on chivalry, loses his mind, and decides he is a knight errant. Convincing a peasant neighbor to accompany him as his squire, he travels around the countryside, wearing an old suit of armor and riding a nag, attempting feats of knighthood that are mostly in his imagination. While doing so, some of those he meets, hearing about his insanity, play a variety of tricks on him, some amusing and some cruel.
","This is a peculiar, if well-intentioned, effort. Illustrated retellings for children of classic adult literature is a large and controversial genre: some think that they take away the pleasure of discovering the real thing later in life, while others believe that it enriches their childhoods. But whichever side you fall on, this one is indeed a very strange concept for a children's book. Start with a story in which the main characters are a deranged old man and his middle-aged sidekick, neither likely to appeal to children. Take nearly 350 pages of often very formal prose, with a few weird anachronisms thrown in, to retell it, and do so in a way that enhances the insanity while leaving out any sense or emotional involvement the original might have had. You end up with a story whose only appeal is the occasional bits of slapstick humor and nonsense.
	Stranger still was the decision to hire a brilliant illustrator, Chris Riddell, who created a wealth of hilarious illustrations, which the book designer then hid, for the most part, behind opaque blocks of text, so that only bits of them are peeking out. This is a large, handsome volume, with pictures on nearly every spread, printed on heavy, glossy stock, and the price reflects this. But they have done a disservice to the illustrator, and chosen and rewritten the story in a way that will have limited appeal to its target audience.
 From the Book:
	Somewhere in La Mancha, in a place whose name I do not care to remember, a gentleman lived not long ago, one of those who has a lance and ancient shield on a shelf and keeps a skinny nag and a greyhound for racing. An occasional stew, beef more often than lamb, hash most nights, eggs and abstinence on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, sometimes squab as a treat on Sundays -- these consumed three-fourths of his income. The rest went for a light woolen tunic and velvet breeches and hose of the same material for feast days, while weekdays were honored with dun-colored coarse cloth. He had a housekeeper past forty, a niece not yet twenty, and a man-of-all-work who did everything from saddling the horse to pruning the trees. Our gentleman was approximately fifty years old; his complexion was weathered, his flesh scrawny, his face gaunt, and he was a very early riser and a great lover of the hunt. Some claim that his family name was Quixada, or Quexada, for there is a certain amount of disagreement among the authors who write of this matter, although reliable conjecture seems to indicate that his name was Quexana. But this does not matter very much to our story; in its telling there is absolutely no deviation from the truth.","Parents need to know that there is a surprisingly high level of violence for a book that looks like it's for middle graders. Most of it is played for laughs, but it involves severe beatings with serious and lasting injuries.

"The Expeditioners and the Treasure of Drowned Man's Canyon: The Expeditioners, Book 1",Gripping adventure of intrepid siblings in steampunk world.,"Ever since their explorer father was declared dead on his last adventure, the West kids -- Zander, the oldest; Christopher (Kit), who shares his dad's passion for maps; and M.K., who's rarely seen without either a wrench or a knife in her hand -- have been trying to eke out an existence in what's left of the family home. When a mysterious stranger with a clockwork hand slips Kit a book that proves to contain part of a map from their late father, the kids are determined to explore the territory and find what their dad was trying to tell them. Unfortunately, hordes of sinister government agents also want the map and don't care what they have to do to get it. Fortunately, the kids make some excellent friends along the way.
","Between Taylor's fast-moving, appealing tale nd Katherine Roy's plentiful illustrations that bring the characters to life, this book has a lot to offer readers young and old. As the kids try to outrun and outwit their pursuers, all while dealing with dark caves, day-glo slugs, giant vultures, and other hazards, there's plenty of age-appropriate excitement.
There's also plenty of opportunity for readers to consider ethical issues -- the destruction of cultures and the theft of their resources by ""explorers,"" cruel exploitation of animals, and the value of loyal friends. Plus the intriguing notion that maps are always wrong because they depict only what we already know about. The book's ending leaves readers wanting more, resolving some issues and setting up further adventures.","Parents need to know that The Expeditioners and the Treasure of Drowned Man's Canyon, the first installment in a series, is an exciting adventure with strong, appealing boy and girl characters that takes place in an alternative world in which computers no longer exist, nor does electricity. It's all steam engines and clockwork, and the United States and its allies have embarked on a whole new era of colonization and exploitation. As the kids follow a map left by their late father, they're often in danger from hostile government agents, and at least one adult character is killed in a violent clash. Aside from the occasional ""damn,"" language isn't a problem. Lots of thought-provoking issues arise, including the impact of exploration on indigenous people who just want to be left alone, and the cruel exploitation of animals.

Then Ivy takes Bean to a secret hideout and reveals she's a witch-in-training. When Ivy offers to cast a ""dancing spell"" on Bean's older sister, Bean is thrilled. As the girls work together on their plan, a friendship is born.
","IVY + BEAN makes the jump to chapter books easier with its large-print, easy-to-follow text, expressive illustrations -- and, most important, two colorful 7-year-old girls.

So typical of real life, these girls, who are neighbors, are urged by their respective mothers to play together. Ivy appears quiet, dainty, and dutiful, and Bean is wild, dirty, and full of sass. Not until they join forces against Bean's older sister do they discover each other's unique qualities. Ivy is actually studying to become a witch. Bean knows how to move through the neighborhood via backyards. Here's to the beginning of a beautiful friendship.","Parents need to know that Ivy + Bean is a multiple award-winning book about making a new friend, learning about differences, and sharing an adventure. On the surface these girls appear to be very different. One wears dresses and reads books; the other has a sassy mouth and likes to get dirty. Some sibling issues occur, including fights with an older sister, stealing her money, playing tricks on her, and calling her names, such as ""tightwad."" With its oversize print, frequent black-and-white illustrations, and easy-to-follow plot, this first book in a consistently funny and engaging series is a great starter chapter book for kids just emerging from being early readers.

Being Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teen,"Candid, chatty memoir is powerful voice for trans kids.","In BEING JAZZ, transgender activist Jazz Jennings, 15, describes what it was like to know -- even as a toddler -- that she was a girl in a boy's body and how her family came to understanding, acceptance, and full, loving support. Jazz recounts her publicized battles to use the girls' bathroom in elementary school and to play on the girls' soccer team. More intimately, she shares how difficult it's been to make and keep friends and pursue romantic relationships. Jazz also discusses dealing with fame from her work as an activist and her family's reality TV show.
","Transgender activist Jazz Jennings holds little back in her frank, funny memoir -- she shares soaring highs and humiliating lows, her ambition and depression, and her unique experience with puberty. In Being Jazz, she writes with the bubbly voice and confident intimacy familiar to her fans from YouTube and TV. Sometimes she's a funny best friend, confiding how she farted through a date or finagled her first French kiss. But she's also an ambassador and advocate, detailing the challenges she's endured as a trans girl: regularly peeing herself in school because she couldn't use the girls' bathroom, being sidelined because she couldn't play on a girls' soccer team, being ostracized by peers because she's transgender.
The narrative can be jumpy, and the name-dropping while she assures readers she's just an ordinary girl is grating. But her no-holds-barred style makes this a vitally important book for trans kids, their friends and family, and anyone who seeks to understand them.","Parents need to know that 15-year-old transgender activist, YouTube star, nd TV personality Jazz Jennings talks frankly about sexual development and romantic drama -- including first kisses and awkward dates -- in her memoir Being Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teen. Jazz is forthright about her difficulties dating and finding good friends nd about dealing with depression. She discusses the bullying and emotional anguish many trans people suffer and their heightened risk for suicide, and she acknowledges her relatively privileged experience as a trans teen with a loving family, material comfort, and broad support. Jazz, who previously co-wrote a picture book for younger children, is very open in discussing her gender identity and puberty: She refers to male and female genitalia with both proper terminology and slang nd discusses slurs referencing her genitalia. She incorporates plentiful references to celebrities, her reality TV series, and her public acclaim and recognition as a trans teen activist.

The Farmer and the Clown,Two strangers form an unlikely bond in sweet wordless tale.,"An older farmer with a long, white beard is working in his field when he sees something fall or jump off a passing circus train. Soon a small, young clown makes his way over to him and does some cheery clowning, then hugs the farmer's legs. The farmer holds the boy's hand nd walks him to his home, where he lives alone. They have a meal and wash up, and the farmer puts the clown to bed. In the morning, the farmer does his own clowning tricks to amuse the boy, feeds him, and then takes him to the barn and field to help with the chores. The two head off for a picnic but see the circus train coming on the horizon. The farmer returns the boy to his clown family, but before the train pulls away the little clown runs back and gives the farmer a big hug. In a subtle touch, they switch hats (the farmer walking back in the tall, pointy, red conical one). The final twist: Unbeknownst to the farmer, the circus monkey is now following him home.
","This is an utterly charming wordless tale that shows the sweet friendship that blossoms between the little clown and the white-haired farmer. The little boy learns about work and life on the farm, nd the farmer opens up to his unexpected visitor and taps into his playful, childish side. Author-illustrator Marla Frazee uses an earthy palette -- except for the baby clown's bright red onesie -- that's perfect for the wide-open-plains setting. She deftly conveys the growing bond between the two and imbues both characters with clear personalities. It's very touching but not sappy. Brilliantly achieved in all ways. ","Parents need to know that The Farmer and the Clown, by two-time Caldecott Honor Book winner Marla Frazee, is a captivating wordless story that traces the close bond that develops between an old man farmer and a young kid clown over the course of about 24 hours. Cute illustrations, gentle humor, and two irresistible characters make this a great choice for reading alone or aloud, at bedtime or anytime.

Hold Me Closer: The Tiny Cooper Story,"Gay teen's coming out becomes a musical in fun, campy novel.","HOLD ME CLOSER: THE TINY COOPER STORY is a musical novel by David Levithan, author of many YA novels, including the book-turned-movie Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist. It tells the life story of flamboyant and proud drama nerd Tiny Cooper, from his appearance on the scene as a ""big gay baby"" up through his childhood, in which sports were sacred, and on to his immersion in the theater, his proclamation of his sexual orientation, and the end of the book, with the ""Parade of Ex-Boyfriends"" who have thus far dashed his quest for teen romance. ","The opening number of the show (in which Tiny declares he's ""happily G-A-Y"") makes it explicitly clear that readers who are uncomfortable with homosexuality should stop reading. In fact, Tiny's stage directions following the song state, ""If anyone is going to object to this musical, they will have left the theater at this point."" But those with an open mind will find a heartwarming, clever, and universal story about the growing pains of puberty and the endless search for love and meaning. There are goofy puns and silly rhymes;  few of the pop-culture jokes don't land; nd the story and message are straightforward almost to the point of being too blatant. But these minor shortcomings re overwhelmingly obscured by the sheer boldness and positivity of the script. The dialogue is a perfect facsimile of stereotypical musical theater, and the use of chorus members, supporting characters, and even the ghost of Oscar Wilde give the story a dynamism that would be ideal for the stage. Although there's no music (yet), readers can imagine the show-stopping choreography and catchy melodies for themselves, adding an element of audience participation. Hold Me Closer is seemingly written for gay teens, but it's equally appealing to anyone interested in the challenges of young adulthood and self-acceptance. ","Parents need to know that David Levithan's Hold Me Closer: The Tiny Cooper Story is a hilarious and campy young adult novel about a boy's journey of self-discovery as a ""big-boned"" gay teen, presented in the format of a Broadway musical script with plenty of stage directions that serve as Tiny's commentary. The Tiny Cooper character was first introduced in Will, Grayson, Will Grayson, the bestselling YA novel by Levithan and John Green. Filled with silly pop-culture and theater-history jokes, Hold Me Closer is perfect for high schoolers, especially kids in drama and performing arts classes. Multidimensional and more profound than meets the eye, the novel twists archetypal narratives about characters across the sexuality spectrum and tells an honest story about a realistic and sympathetic protagonist grappling with the ecstasy and heartbreak of young love. There are references to homosexual relations, pornography, and masturbation but no strong language other than one ""helluva"" and a lyric about a boy worrying that a coach might kick his ""ass."" Body-positive and anti-bully, Hold Me Closer is a proud rebuttal to the negative stereotyping adolescents often endure.

The Poet Slave of Cuba: A Biography of Juan Francisco Manzano,Brutal but moving bio in verse is best for teens.,"The first part of the life of Juan Francisco Manzano, until his escape from slavery, is told in a series of poems, from a variety of viewpoints and voices. A child prodigy, with perfect recall and amazing talent in poetry, he is treated as a performing pet by his first mistress. But when she dies, his insane new mistress abuses and tortures him horribly until he finally escapes. Includes brief bibliography, historical background, and four excerpts of Manzano's poetry.
","For teens, this is a solid introduction to an all-but-forgotten literary and historical figure, and the tale of survival and defiance has moments of uplift. The Poet Slave of Cuba will inspire readers to wonder: Why did Juan persist in reading and writing when it invariably brought him beatings? How did his abilities sustain him? Teens may also be interested in finding out about his life, or those of other slave poets, such as George Moses Horton, Jupiter Hammon, and Phyllis Wheatley.
Unfortunately, readers may find that the free verse leaves some aspects of the story unclear, such as how Juan ends up with the Marquesa after being granted his freedom. Authors of similar works (see Your Own, Sylvia by Stephanie Hemphill, for example) solve that problem by the use of footnotes and/or endnotes. No such luck here -- the historical note only picks up after the story ends. Also, Manzano lived in Cuba in the early 1800s, and it's likely that most young readers will know little about that society -- it would have been useful if the note had given some context.
 ","Parents need to know that this is an award-winning book of poetry about the real life of Cuban slave Juan Francisco Manzano. The main character, a child during the story's telling, is repeatedly and persistently beaten, whipped, and tortured. The level of violence and brutality in this book make it very intense and probably a better fit for teens -- though readers of any age are sure to be disturbed. Even so, it is the winner of a number of awards, including the American Library Association Best Books for Young Adults, the IRA Children's Book Award, the Pura Belpre Author Award, and more. Teens will learn about a literary and historical figure, and also be moved by Juan's story, and how he uses his love of poetry and words to tolerate horrific conditions.

Princesses Are Not Just Pretty,Character counts more than looks is the light lesson here.,"Princesses Mellie, Allie, and Libby are lounging under the rose trellis in their palace by the sea when they get into a bit of an argument: Who among them is the prettiest of them all? An upturned nose, freckles like cinnamon, purple hair -- surely one of these things is superior to the others. They eventually decide to hold a contest, but on the way to the judging, a few distractions prove these princesses are about much more than their good looks.
","PRINCESSES ARE NOT JUST PRETTY has a few things going for it. The watercolor illustrations are gorgeous, creating a frilly, pastel, Marie Antoinette color palate of delicate richness. And the story, which stresses the importance of character, action, and kindness among princesses inclined toward arguments about vanity, is a nice twist. The issue is that for very young kids, or those merely tiptoeing on the fringe of princess culture, the first half of the book -- with its appealing frivolity and who's-prettier banter -- has a way of inadvertently reinforcing what it sets out to contrast. Plus, the message that being pretty isn't all that matters, feels slight in comparison to the very thing that makes being a princess fun in the first place -- sitting around eating cupcakes in grand dresses and elaborately coiffed manes.
Parents looking to distract from princess culture altogether may have better luck with more surefooted entries in the Adventurous Princesses category. But those who are happy to find an artful book that appeals to the fanatic, while stressing positive lessons about doing good for others -- emphasis on doing something at all -- will be delighted.","Parents need to know That Princesses Are Not Just Pretty -- the third in the Princesses Are Not... series -- subverts the typical tropes about princesses as beautiful creatures who don't do much, and offers an unexpected twist. However, it still shows them arguing at length over who is the fairest of them all, and has a resolution that feels slight. The message here is ultimately positive, but for toddlers or preschoolers, it could inadvertently reinforce what it aims to counter. May be best for veteran princess devotees in need of a good lesson in an appealing package.

The Girl I Used to Be,Teen hunts for her parents' killer in page-turning mystery.,"Olivia Reinhart grew up believing her mother had been murdered by her father. After the death of the grandmother who became her guardian, Olivia found herself adrift in the foster care system and was briefly adopted. Now a 17-year-old emancipated minor living on her own in Portland, Oregon, she’s stunned to learn from local police that her father’s body has been discovered and that he was not her mother’s killer. Olivia decides to return to the hometown she barely remembers to search for the truth about what happened to her parents. THE GIRL I USED TO BE is an apt title, as Olivia tells no one in town that she's really Ariel Benson (her name had been changed when she was adopted), the daughter who witnessed her mother's murder but was left unharmed by the killer. Aided by Duncan, a childhood friend who recognizes her but agrees to keep her secret, Olivia begins putting together a list of suspects -- a list that includes some of the people closest to her parents. ","A tough yet vulnerable teen sleuth with a tragic past, a secret identity, two unsolved murders, and a killer on the loose make for an engaging and page-turning read. Olivia's determination to not only solve her parents' murders but also make a future for herself should be inspiring to readers. But parents may find the depiction of Olivia's life as an emancipated minor a bit too good to be true. Those with older readers might want to use her story as the starting point in a discussion about the realities of life for teens who have the ""freedom"" to make all their own choices. ","Parents need to know that The Girl I Used to Be by April Henry (Shock Point) is a murder mystery with a tough and determined teen heroine who's been forced to grow up too soon.

Then, 14 years later, evidence is uncovered proving her father died that same day. Now 17 nd living on her own, Olivia returns to her hometown intent on solving the mystery of her parents' murders. It's a quick, fast-paced read, and Olivia's a character readers will root for. While violence is at the core of the story -- three characters are killed, one is shot, and Olivia has a flashback of her mother's murder -- nothing's described in graphic detail.

"Mortal Danger: The Immortal Game, Book 1",Revenge plot gets lost in supernatural mishmash.,"Edith ""Edie"" Kramer has been bullied throughout high school by the Teflon crew, a group of beautiful teens. At the beginning of the novel, she wants to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge but is stopped by handsome stranger Kian, who tells Edie she doesn't have to end her life, she can exact revenge instead. Kian gives her three favors to set her plan in motion. Edie soon realizes she's the pawn in a supernatural game that will carry out her revenge -- but hurt the people she loves.
","The premise of MORTAL DANGER will make readers pick up the book. Readers will want to see how Edie exacts her revenge on the people who have tormented her throughout high school. However, author Ann Aguirre fails to make Edie a sympathetic character by not showing readers at the beginning of the novel how she was bullied and making us root for her and dislike her tormentors. Readers may groan at the way Edie wants to exact her revenge -- by becoming beautiful so she can infiltrate the group of beautiful people who hurt her. Once Edie becomes beautiful, she suddenly -- and implausibly -- gains self-confidence, poise, and cattiness she never had before and inexplicably befriends some of her bullies. They're actually kind of nice, while Edie's the one making cruel comments. As for Kian, the insta-love interest, Edie starts kissing him shortly after meeting him and abandons all logic due to her love for him. Thrown into the mix is a supernatural game between warring monster groups, as well as the Japanese gang the Yakuza, while the revenge plot goes out the window and the book becomes more about supernatural agencies, urban legends, and creepy monsters than bullying.
Mortal Danger does have some good points, such as Edie being a good friend and daughter. But the plot is very confusing, with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in. It would have been more interesting had the author dug deeper into bullying and how, through Edie's own devices, things start to unravel.","Parents need to know that Mortal Danger, the first book in The Immortal Game series, is about teen girl Edie wanting to get revenge on the teens at her high school who've bullied her. But the novel switches from being a story of revenge to a supernatural game between warring groups of monsters, in which Edie is a pawn. There's some violence, with descriptions of death and suicide, but it's brief. Swear words (""ass"", ""assholes,"" ""bitch,"" ""bitches,"" ""crap,"" ""s--t,"" ""Christ,"" ""hell,"" ""damn"") are littered throughout. There's talk of sex and some description of kissing, hugging, caressing, and more.

At age 10 she started flying lessons, and got her license at age 16. She became famous in 1928 for being the first person to fly under all four bridges across New York's East River -- when she was just 17. She did it on a dare to prove that girls could be as good -- or better -- than men at flying planes.
","SOAR, ELINOR is an inspiring, exciting, beautifully illustrated picture book biography. Not only does it show a brave, talented girl defying gender bias, it also tells a rollicking good story of someone training hard for a goal and bravely attempting a record-breaking feat.

Francois Roca's stunning paintings capture both the era and the determination of this amazing young woman.
An Author's Note gives more biographical infromation about Elinor's life after her bridges stunt, including the fact that in 2000, at age 89, she ""flew"" the NASA Space Shuttle Simulator. In a note about her sources, author Tami Lewis Brown, a licensed pilot, recalls long interviews with Elinor and her son Patrick Sullivan, during which ""I held her goggles to my face and wore her flight helmet.""

The Invention of Hugo Cabret,Spectacular cinematic book has lots of heart.,"When Hugo's father, a clockmaker, is killed in a fire, Hugo is taken in by his uncle. They live together in a hidden room inside the walls of the Paris train station, where it's the uncle's job to maintain the station clocks -- until one night he disappears. Now Hugo is alone, still living inside the station walls, stealing to survive, and maintaining the clocks so no one will know his uncle is gone.
Hugo also works on an automaton, a mechanical man, that his father was trying to restore. He steals parts from a toy shop in the station. When he's caught, the mean store owner takes away his father's notebook and threatens him with arrest. But the old man's hidden past and Hugo's are intertwined, and the secret message hidden in the automaton's workings is only the beginning. ","THE INVENTION OF HUGO CABRET is like nothing you've seen before. When you or your child first pick it up, it looks like one of those fat fantasies that are so popular these days. When you open it, it seems similar to a graphic novel. But lengthy sections of wordless illustrations (284 pages of drawings) are interspersed with pages of more traditional prose. But neither text nor pictures can stand without the other.
Brian Selznick's brilliant hybrid is put in service of a complex and heartfelt story that involves a plucky orphan, the history of early cinema, the mechanics of clocks and other intricate machinery, and a little bit of magic. The whole is a work of great beauty and excitement, with breathless pacing ramped up even further by the wordless sections. Selznick has created an entirely new art form that succeeds as art, literature, and entertainment. ","Parents need to know that Brian Selznick's poignant, magical Caldecott Medal-winning The Invention of Hugo Cabret is set in a Paris train station and features a 12-year-old hero who's had a sad life. Orphaned, alone, and homeless, he lives by stealing and scavenging, and no one is kind to him until late in the book. The wholly original story is told largely in beautiful black-and-white charcoal drawings -- 284 pages of them -- whose perspective pans in and out the way shots in a film would. It was made into a live-action movie titled Hugo nd released in 2011.

His efforts to win Princess Smartypants have more to do with ego than affection (one of the medals on his uniform is shaped like a pig, just the kind of detail that adds humor and depth to this feminist tale). The ending comes as a surprise. It seems Princess Smartypants has finally met her match, until she pulls that last trick out of her bag. A cry of ""Yahoo!"" went up during a read-aloud when a group of 5-year-olds came to this subversive moment.","Parents need to know that kds will cheer for the resourceful heroine.

Moxy Maxwell Does Not Love Stuart Little,Offbeat fun ideal for early chapter book readers.,"Full of offbeat, creative ideas, 9-year-old Moxy Maxwell has put off her summer reading assignment until the very last minute. Even on the final afternoon before school starts up again, she finds a million things to keep her from the task at hand. One thing leads to another and the situation gets way out of hand before Moxy finally makes friends with Stuart Little ... and amazes even herself.
","When her parents named her Moxy, they may not have known what they were asking for; this is one kid who is definitely living up to her name. She is dramatic, energetic, and impulsive. However, she also exaggerates, and procrastinates, which can lead her into trouble. It's not so much that Moxy doesn't love Stuart Little, it's just that she doesn't find enough ""in-between time"" to get the book read. Even when her mother threatens her with consequences, she can't find the discipline to sit down and get started. But who can really blame her? Her entire household seems rather free, undisciplined ... and creative.
Though the story itself is a little far-fetched, the premise is believable enough, and the format is entertaining. Written in short one- or two-page chapters that are headed in a manner reminiscent of Winnie-the-Pooh stories, events are illustrated with photographs supposedly taken by Moxy's twin brother Mark. Spotted here and there with narrator comments that may be hard for a 7-year-old to appreciate, the story, with all its silly shenanigans, is easy to read, and especially fun for the reader just starting out with chapter books.","Parents need to know that Moxy is a procrastinator whose independence wavers on the verge of insolence. But she means well. While kids may be amazed at some of her ideas and explanations -- and think some of her antics unbelievable -- they may also find much of the story funny, and familiar.

Keeping Quilt,"Rich, fascinating, and heartwarming story.","When you move to a country far away, how can you keep your homeland close? For Anna and her family, the answer is to make a quilt from pieces of clothing from Russia. This heart-warming story wraps around readers like a warm blanket.
 ","This is a touching tale about the love between generations. Children were interested in seeing the storyteller's family move through life. The children especially related to Patricia, the most Americanized in her ways among the family members, who used the quilt as a tent and as a tablecloth for her first birthday party.< The book is particularly effective in explaining some of the customs of the Russian-Jewish family: When Great-Grandpa Sasha proposes to Anna, he gives her ""a gold coin, a dried flower, and a piece of rock salt ... the gold was for wealth, the flower for love, and the salt so their lives would have flavor.""
Author and illustrator Patricia Polacco chose to have the quilt be the only object in full color; the rest of her sketches are beige and brown. In the same sense, it is the tradition and love of the family that brings color to the characters' lives. The illustrations enhance the author's meaning.","Parents need to know that innovative artwork enhances this rich and fascinating story involving a family leaving Russia.

Becoming Joe DiMaggio,Poems about growing up during WWII.,"Joseph Paul is named after Joltin' Joe by his grandfather, Papa Angelo, with whom he spends his time listening to ball games on the radio. His father is in jail, and his mother has trouble making ends meet. Then World War II starts, his father comes home, and DiMaggio goes to war. But through the years, dreaming of becoming a ball player or a doctor, he yearns to make his grandfather's \""broken heart soar.\""
","Based on stories of the author's family, the book, written as 24 short, free-verse poems, weaves a delicate spell of humor, nostalgia, and sadness. In doing so, he somehow captures two lives -- Joseph's and his grandfather's. It's astounding how much is hinted at and filled in in the reader's mind: the grandfather's difficult immigrant life and hopes for his son and then his grandson, the violent father's brushes with the law, the mother's trials in raising the family with and without him, the giftedness of the grandson, on whom the family's hopes are pinned, the career of DiMaggio and his importance to immigrant families.

Your child may be surprised that in discussion it takes far longer to unpack all the layers of meaning and content than it did to read the book. That's the power of poetry.","Parents need to know that some background on DiMaggio and the period will help kids get more out of this.

A Curious Tale of the In-Between,"Kinda creepy, kinda sweet ghost story for big kids, tweens.","Pram is a very special 11-year-old girl who's been able to see ghosts for as long as she can remember. Even her best friend is a ghost who lives by the pond near Pram's house. After years of being homeschooled by her aunts, it's decided that she should attend regular school. On her first day there, she meets Clarence, and they quickly become friends. Having a real, living friend who needs her help gives Pram the courage to try to find her father, whom she's never met and who might not even know she exists. But getting the answers to her questions leads her and Clarence into the clutches of the mysterious Lady Savant, a spiritualist who says she'll help Pram find what she's looking for. But what does she want in return?
","This is a successful combination of the creepy atmospherics that ghost-story lovers crave with a sweet story about truly selfless friendship. Veteran YA author Lauren DeStefano (The Chemical Garden Trilogy, the Internment Chronicles series) tries her hand at storytelling for a younger age group in A CURIOUS TALE OF THE IN-BETWEEN, and she strikes the right balance between suspenseful chills and heartwarming lessons about the nature of friendship.
Kids and tweens will relate to Pram's struggles to fit in, and they'll admire her quest for answers as she and her friends learn the value of helping others, especially when what they need is not what you want for yourself.","Parents need to know that A Curious Tale of the In-Between is a ghost story from YA veteran Lauren DeStefano, her first foray into writing for big kids and tweens. Lots of talk about death, ghosts, and the afterlife lend a creepy atmosphere, but all ghosts are benign and many are helpful and friendly. The overall messages about death are positive, in that death is not seen as the end but as ""just what comes next."" Violence is infrequent and involves mostly vague recountings of the past (including a suicide by hanging), and the heroes are in peril a couple of times. The kids are all good models for friendship, loyalty, and bravery.

1919 The Year That Changed America,"Riveting tale of racial, labor protests, women's vote, more.","The first of six chapters in 1919 THE YEAR THAT CHANGED AMERICA, under the heading ""An Amazing Event,"" recount the Great Molasses Flood. A tank storing 2.3 million gallons of molasses exploded and sent deadly waves of the thick liquid into Boston's North End, destroying everything in its path. While the company blamed anarchists and Communists, a court would, for the first time, find a company liable for its negligence. The ""Women Got the Vote"" section looks at suffragists, the women who fought for 70 years for the passage of the 19th Amendment, and the people and groups who opposed it. ""The Red Summer"" chronicles not only waves of violence against African Americans, but also how, for the first time, African Americans mounted armed resistance against mobs of Whites. The fall of Russia to the Communists in 1917, sent a wave of fear across America and created ""The Red Scare."" Communists were thought to be behind labor strikes, suspected Communists were rounded up and deported, and the Department of Justice created a Communist-hunting division headed by a young J. Edgar Hoover. Soldiers returning from World War I expected to find better wages and working conditions. When they didn't, 1919 saw ""Strikes and More Strikes,"" with 36,000 work stoppages (including a strike by the Boston Police Department) that were met with violent responses from companies who blamed the troubles on Communists and  ""foreigners."" The final chapter, ""A Noble Experiment,"" looks at the history behind the movement to ban the production and sale of alcohol and the crime wave (think Al Capone) created by Prohibition.
","Even reluctant readers should be captivated by the wealth of personal stories and archival photos that bring this pivotal year in U.S. history vividly alive. While 1919 The Year That Changed America looks at the nation's past, it also presents provocative questions about the present and how some of the most complex and divisive social issues in American life are still to be resolved.","Parents need to know that Martin W. Sandler's 1919 The Year That Changed America won the 2019 National Book Award for Young People's Literature. The year 1919 was unlike almost any other in American history. Women had finally won the right to vote, Prohibition was about to take effect, and a fear of Communists and anarchists swept the nation. Throughout the year, there would be often unimaginable acts of violence against African Americans and workers protesting low wages and terrible working conditions. The six chapters cover social issues and events many students may already have studied in class (women's suffrage) and others that may be surprising to both readers and their parents (a deadly molasses flood that destroyed parts of Boston's North End). Violence is a thread that runs throughout the book, with lynchings, fire bombings, and rampaging mobs becoming  new normal across America. This is history that's surprising, vividly told and thought-provoking.

Let the Sky Fall,"Ponderous backstory bogs down ""air elemental"" romance.","Vane thinks he's just another Southern California kid lazing through a summer, sweating it out in the desert heat and hoping to finally kiss a girl on a blind date. When the big moment finally arrives, a huge gust of cold wind knocks the would-be kissers apart. Enter Audra, an air elemental called a sylph, who's been secretly protecting Vane for the past 10 years -- because he's actually a sylph who's lost his memory and fated to be bound for life to the first person he kisses. Between warding off romantic partners and hiding Vane from the enemies who killed his parents, she's been busy. Vane and Audra finally meet, but, before he has a chance to understand the situation, he has to prepare for a cosmic battle while coping with romantic feelings for Audra.
","After werewolves, vampires, and angels, you can just see the publishers wondering what to do for an encore, and that's the book's only problem: the setup. Despite author Sharon Messenger's heroic efforts to keep readers interested with lush romantic scenery and tense personal struggles, there's a steep learning curve involving four winds and their personalities, the powers of sylphs, and Vane's role in the cosmic drama. Let the Sky Fall has some great characters and an intriguing twist at the end, setting up a sequel that benefits from the first book's world-building.","Parents need to know that Let the Sky Fall is the first in Shannon Messenger's fantasy-romance series about beings called air elementals or sylphs. The romance doesn't get very physical, since lead characters Vane and Audra would be bonded for life if they kissed. Besides, they're more preoccupied with saving themselves from the beings who killed his parents and her father a decade before and who tortured and killed many others, including one family that was ""torn apart like rag dolls."" In a climactic battle, turbulent winds stab an enemy. Audra, a strong character working through a lot of guilt, will especially appeal to girls; the peaceable Vane makes for a good contrast and may inspire interesting discussions about the role of peacemakers in wartime.

Turtle in Paradise,"Depression-era story teaches history, meaning of family.","When her mother gets a job as a housekeeper for a rich woman who will not abide children, 11-year-old Turtle is sent to live with her relatives in Key West. This all happens during the Great Depression, and no one is living too high off the hog, especially the Conches. However, a place is made for her, and her cat, and they all make do. Turtle pitches in with the group of boys that include her cousins and their friends, fishes for sponges with Slow Poke (who turns out to be her dad), builds a relationship with her grumpy grandmother, searches for treasure -- and finds it. In the end, she learns important lessons about what having real family means, and that life often does not have a ""Hollywood ending,"" even when it turns out.
","Kids will find it easy to get swept up in this award-winning book, which is full of adventure, humor, and historical detail. Except for the fact that everyone is dirt-poor, living in Key West during the Depression seems like a good life for kids. Readers will enjoy watching Turtle and her new friends run around barefoot, explore on their own, or work together to run a business, trading babysitting for candy as part of The Diaper Gang. Everyone in town seems to be related and has a telling nickname -- which means Turtle's story is packed with eccentric characters, ranging from the ragtag boys who are often up to some kind of harmless mischief to sponge fishermen who speak of pirates and treasure. This book imparts  sweet lesson about family, but it is also just plain fun to read. ","Parents need to know that this Newbery Honor book focuses on a young girl who is sent to live with relatives in Key West during the Depression. There are mischievous boys who make some trouble, including setting the tail of the main character's cat on fire, but little else to worry about. This story is based on actual family tales, and claims to give a true look at life during the Depression in Key West. Places are real, and even Ernest Hemingway makes an appearance. The author includes photographs and notes and suggests other books and websites readers could explore. Readers will relate to Turtle: She is tough on the outside, with a soft underbelly, just like a turtle. She is smart, strong, helpful, generous, and pretty wise for an 11-year-old.

A Tangle of Knots,"Intriguing tale of fate, connections, and recipes.","In a world much like our own, only stranger, the course of your life depends heavily on whether you have a Talent. Eleven-year-old orphan Cady has a definite talent for baking; her friend Marigold, whose family becomes Cady's neighbors after their city apartment is demolished by a hot air balloon, struggles to find her own talent and to restrain her brother, a skilled thief, from exercising his. Like A TANGLE OF KNOTS, the connections between the girls and many apparently random characters emerge, flourish, and bring unexpected solutions.
","The convoluted puzzle that connects several generations of characters will delight some readers, and probably have them rereading for clues they've missed. Other readers may bog down and find too much complication for too little payoff. Some connections that bind the characters reveal themselves in a leisurely fashion, or not at all; author Graff frequently describes a character grinning ""in a way that suggested that he knew more about the world than he was letting on,"" and this attitude infuses the narrative, often leaving young readers to figure out obliquely suggested details for themselves.
Still, many kids will relate to Cady's longing for a family and Marigold's efforts to keep her own family from running off the rails. Cady's talent is for making the perfect cake for each recipient, and A Tangle of Knots includes numerous recipes for baked goods, both sweet and savory, that are sure to appeal to budding chefs.  ","Parents need to know that A Tangle of Knots takes its title from both the extensive collection of knots belonging to one of the characters, and the way in which the often-hidden threads of the characters' lives converge and intertwine. In a magic-enhanced version of Poughkeepsie, NY, and its surroundings, material objects have a mind of their own in deciding what person to connect with, and people are divided into those with a Talent and those without. Meanwhile, a villain finds a way to steal Talents from those who have them. Thefts by two other characters (one recent, one long past) influence plot developments. Some of the dysfunctional family and neighbor relationships, from parent-child conflict to burglary, may unnerve kids who live in a more harmonious world.

Two or Three Things I Forgot to Tell You,"Authentic look at suicide, cutting, bullying, friendship.","Told in three parts, TWO OR THREE THINGS I FORGOT TO TELL YOU shows the impact of an enigmatic teen girl's friendship -- and suicide -- on a group of other girls, particularly two high school seniors. In the first part -- told after Tink's suicide -- Merissa is a seemingly perfect overachiever with a dangerous secret: She enjoys cutting herself, even contemplating suicide after her family starts falling apart. The second part focuses on Tink herself, a former child actress who transferred into Merissa's elite private school and shook things up with her unapologetic attitude. Always unpredictable -- this is a girl who said \""I'd like to be your friend, but only if you promise not to ever, ever count on me\"" -- her friends are hurt when she says goodbye to them forever through an impersonal text message. The final part is about Nadia, who deals with cruel bullying and a crush on a teacher that spins dangerously out of control. Tink taught these girls a lot while she was alive, and she continues to be there for them after her death, encouraging her friends to be brave enough to grow up and face up to life's hardships.

Half-Moon Investigations,Clever detective fiction for middle-graders.,"Fletcher Moon, known around school as \""Half-Moon\"" due to his size, has qualified as a private eye after taking Internet classes. So far he has only used it to solve petty schoolyard crimes, with payment in candy. But now he's on to something much bigger -- and more dangerous.
There's a conspiracy going on in town, and possibly more than one. They involve a local criminal family, a club of pink-clad girly-girls, a school talent show, arson, theft, and assault. And soon Fletcher finds himself in way over his head, as he is framed for arson and flees custody with a known delinquent, who may be more than he seems.
","Eoin Colfer, author of the bestselling Artemis Fowl series, brings his trademark combination of humor, brilliant kids, gritty violence, and likable villains to a new setting. Fletcher is a nerdy wimp of a kid detective, with a sharp mind and an inner core of steel, who narrates the story in the style of a '40s potboiler. Much more interesting is his reluctant partner, Red -- son of a local gangster, with a heart of gold, a short fuse, the gift of cool charisma, and the skills of his heritage.
Fletcher receives an extraordinary lack of sympathy from any adult, including his parents, after he is beaten badly enough to require surgery, which, by the way, was more violent than necessary for the storyline. When a child is beaten unconscious by an adult with a club, it doesn't register as the humorous, cartoon violence the author seems to think it is. But overall this is a satisfying romp.","Parents need to know that Fletcher is beaten with a club into unconsciousness and hospitalized.

Soon, international evil organization SPYDER is hot on his trail again, this time, ready to make good on the threats they never quite pulled off in the previous installment. Does Ben harbor secret talents he's never managed to tap into, or is he still just classic spy-bait?

Parents can appreciate that this sequel continues to set a high bar for marrying the guilty pleasure of blockbuster spy movies with an affection for big words, history, and an admiration for experience and wisdom, and also gets gender parity right.","Parents need to know that Spy Camp, the sequel to Spy School, is a mystery about a summer camp that trains teens to be future spies and is full of the sustained peril and weapons-obsessed mayhem typical of the spy genre. In this series, the violence is more cartoonish than realistic and often plays for humor. A character dies in an explosion, but it's not graphic, and there's no bloodshed. The book also has a few instances of stealing to aid a character, for which there are no consequences. There's no swearing but frequent name-calling typical of teens, such as ""wuss,"" ""dork,"" and ""whack-job.""

Belle Epoque,Charming story of plucky plain Jane in 1880s Paris.,"Young Maude Pichon in desperation takes a job with an agency as a repoussoir, someone who makes another seem more beautiful in contrast to her own plainness. She struggles with the ethics of this while getting swept up the glamorous world of the Paris aristocracy in the 1880s. Genuine friendship grows with her client's daughter Isabelle, the one she's supposed to make look better, until Isabelle learns who Maude really is. Eventually the two are able to put an end to the agency and pursue their own dreams, free from the clutches of Isabelle's socially ambitious mother.
","BELLE EPOQUE is full of small historical details that will resonate with those who know a little about the Impressionist painters. But the details of daily life that might have given the novel broader appeal are glossed over. Still, the backdrop is interesting and unusual enough to enchant imaginative readers. Maude is easy to relate to, and her determination and struggles eventually lead the way to a contented life in which she can love and be loved while she pursues her dream of becoming a professional photographer.","Parents need to know that Belle Epoque is a historical novel set in 1880s Paris about a young woman discovering her own self worth and pursuing her dreams. There's absolutely no violence and only two sweet kisses, making it OK for younger tweens who can handle the occasional scenes of excessive drinking, which is not glamorized. The message that beauty comes from within is one young women can't read too often.

Lenny & Lucy,Masterful book about moving is emotionally powerful.,"In LENNY & LUCY, a family -- a boy, a dad, and a dog -- move into a new home. The boy, Peter, doesn't like the new house nd can't sleep at night, afraid of the dark woods just on the other side of the wooden bridge. He makes a guardian figure out of pillows and blankets, ""Lenny"" of the title, to sit at the edge of the bridge ""and keep the dark woods on the other side where they belong."" When Lenny's lonely (as Peter clearly is), Peter makes him a companion, Lucy. Then a neighbor girl comes over to play, and the girl's mother offers housewarming treats to the dad. Lenny and Lucy continue to guard the bridge, but now Peter's found a new friend.
","Caldecott winners Philip C. and Erin. E. Stead have collaborated on another masterful, quietly powerful story with a classic feel, this one about moving and fear of the unknown. Adults will understand that Peter is projecting his fears about moving onto the dark, unknown woods, but the story wisely takes his fear literally and pictures him working concretely to protect and comfort himself. There's a quiet reassurance in the guardian figures coming to life and playing with Peter and his dog, and the introduction of the new friend and neighbor is just as gentle and understated. An added plus: The book is implicitly inclusive. Peter's family is pictured as single-parent, headed by a dad, and the neighbors who welcome and befriend them are a family of color.","Parents need to know that Lenny & Lucy, by the Caldecott-winning team of Philip C. nd Erin E. Stead (A Sick Day for Amos McGee), is a beautifully artful book about a boy (Peter) and his dad who've just moved. Much of the story, including the specifics of Peter's fears, is gently implied rather than spelled out. We see the family arrive in their packed-up car, and Peter can't sleep when his fears about his new home focus on the dark woods nearby. Peter builds two figures out of blankets to guard the house and comfort himself. These provide a helpful model for readers nd  reminder for parents to deal with kids' fears seriously and concretely. The art, in a hushed, calming palette, is as gently reassuring as the story nd pictures a single dad nd neighbors of color who welcome and befriend Peter's family.

Across the Bay,Emotional but unlikely journey of boy in Old San Juan.,"ACROSS THE BAY is a heartwarming story of a young boy's search for family and identity. The main character, a young boy named Carlitos, lives in the small town of Cataño, Puerto Rico -- across the bay from the capital, in a happy home with his mother, his abuela, and their cat, Coco. Carlitos loves his family but notices that something sets him and his family apart. Other neighborhood kids play basketball, learn to ride a bike, and go to the barbershop with their father while he goes to the barbershop with his mother. When Carlitos asks about Papi, his mother tells him that his father is across the bay in Old San Juan. She explains that ""sometimes things don't work out"" and reassures him that he is loved. Still, his yearning for his father takes him on a solo journey to find him. He tucks a photo of his father into his pocket and leaves home without anyone noticing, boarding a ferry all by himself to Old San Juan. Almost immediately, Carlitos can sense the vastness of the city as he watches Old San Juan grow bigger and bigger from his seat on the ferry. Once across the bay, he enlists the help of strangers but is unsuccessful in his quest to find Papi. His journey takes him through the maze-like streets of the old city, to old viejitos playing dominos on the street, to a lively parade, and finally to the castle El Morro, where he learns an important lesson. The colorful characters he meets along the way help illustrate a cultural setting and become part of the boy's emotional journey to find the true meaning of home. Eventually he makes his way to the edge of Old San Juan, where, from across the bay, he catches a glimpse of his hometown and is quickly reminded of where he belongs.

","This is an enchanting picture book set in Old San Juan. Carlos Aponte's vibrant illustrations bring the color and personality of Puerto Rico to life but may leave you longing to hear more Spanish. The occasional ""buenos dias"" and a short verse from a popular Puerto Rican song are about all that's included. Still, Across the Bay beautifully captures some of the unique culture and colorfulness of the ancient city of Old San Juan. Each page also displays a varied spectrum of brown skin shades that may prompt young readers to appreciate differences and find beauty within their own uniqueness. It's a story that can also speak to kids whose families don't look like everyone else's.
Carlitos' decision to take off on his own may be concerning but could also present a great opportunity to talk with kids about possible dangers, including reasons why they shouldn't talk to strangers.Schedule

This colorful picture book transports readers into the heart of Puerto Rico as young Carlitos goes off on a voyage to find the father he yearns to meet. Even though Carlitos is happy with his family, a desire for more pushes him to sneak out of his home and take a ferry to San Juan all by himself to find his father. Vibrant illustrations in a tropical palette draw readers in as Carlitos makes his way across the bay and then wanders through the streets of Old San Juan searching high and low for Papi. Eventually, Carlitos realizes that he already has everything he needs with his mother and his abuela, and he returns home without finding his father. It's a joyous but unresolved ending.

"Broken Ground: Spirit Animals: Fall of the Beasts, Book 2","Solid storytelling, intensity in spin-off series sequel.","Our four heroes with Great Beasts as spirit animals continue to aid the Greencloaks in finding other children who have bonded with Great Beasts before the evil Zerif does. Zerif continues to collect the Great Beasts and amass an army of humans, all infected by a parasitic worm that travels under the skin until it reaches a victim's forehead and takes over his or her mind. Abeke and Rollan head to the town of Stetriol by ship hoping to save a girl who bounded with Ninani the swan from Zerif's clutches. Meilin and Conor remain trapped under the Earth, desperate to reach the source of the parasitic infestation and Zerif's powers: a creature called the Wyrm that's eating away at the roots of the Evertree. For Conor it's a race against the parasite that's already under his skin and crawling toward his forehead. Can he be saved in time?
 
","Kudos to this many-author, many-book spin-off series for staying well-written, fresh, and exciting. Given the factors of a busy website and games and the nature of spin-off series in general, some expected BROKEN GROUND to be only average. In fact, much of the main Spirit Animals series leaned more toward average than riveting. But readers who make it through will be rewarded with Fall of the Beasts.
 

It's hard to believe author Victoria Schwab (The Archived and The Unbound) is writing about this world for the first time. She captures the main characters well, showing both their strengths and fears. The addition of red-caped, masked fighters adds a welcome layer of mystery. Depending on what kind of reader you are, the ending is either exasperating or thrilling: Things get worse for the characters, never better, and nothing is resolved. But both kinds of readers will doubtless be clamoring for the next in the series. Keep the good authors coming.
 ","Parents need to know that Broken Ground is the second book in the Fall of the Beasts spin-off series that picks up at the end of the original, highly popular Spirit Animals series, and it's similarly multimedia and multi-author. There's a website where young readers can choose their own spirit animals and character identities nd enter codes from the books they read to unlock prizes and whatnot. Each book is by a different children's author, and books are released every few months, starting in August 2015. Both Spirit Animals series are set up for animal-loving tween readers just digging into fantasy books, and it's much easier to read Immortal Guardians if you've read the other series. The first book in this spin-off series, Immortal Guardians, offered more scares and creepiness than the last series. Book 2, Broken Ground, adds a level of intensity as hundreds of zombie-like creatures attack and their numbers grow as parasites travel under the skins of victims until they reach their foreheads. Main characters who normally don't kill (with arrows and knives) realize that's the only way to stop them and take down a number of the zombies. Other main characters are stuck underground battling more of those zombies, as well as spiders (one giant one), a fire, and a tentacled creature. Bravery and teamwork remain the strongest assets of the four diverse tween characters at the heart of the two series. This installment even offers wisdom about how standing up for others and making a difference aren't easy but are important.

Jumping Off Swings,Fast-moving coming-of-age tale with sex and consequences.,"Ellie keeps getting played by the guys she has sex with, including Josh. Hoping for a romantic relationship, she thinks each experience will be different and each time they use her. When Ellie finds out she's pregnant after her and Josh's ""one time thing,"" her life changes and so does the lives of those around her, including Corinne, her best friend, Caleb, who's had a crush on her for years, and Josh. What is she going to do? What can she do?
","Jo Knowles makes a common story more interesting by presenting it from four different perspectives: Ellie's, Josh's, Josh's friend Caleb's, and Ellie's best friend Corinne's. That gives layers, texture, and depth to what would have been a basic sex-and-teens novel. The characters all possess a vulnerability that rings true, and that readers will relate to.
The novel moves swiftly, making it a good choice for reluctant readers. And because there are consequences for actions, it's a great book to start discussions with teens about sex and relationships.","Parents need to know that this book about unplanned pregnancy has frank talk about sex and relationship issues among teens. The main character sleeps with many boys and one ""hook-up"" results in pregnancy. There is some swearing (including ""f--k""), copious drinking (adult alcoholism and teen drinking), and discussions of abortion and unplanned pregnancies. Parents and teachers can use this book to start discussions with teens about sex and relationships. It will give readers a lot to think about, including what teens are looking for when they enter sexual relationships, and the different ways sexual rumors impact male and female reputations.

Go Ask Alice,"Authentic, tragic tale of teen drug addiction -- a classic.","We never learn her name. She's 15, the daughter of a college professor. She's given LSD at a party and loves it. She dives into the drug world, and soon begins selling to children to pay for her own drugs. She runs away and is again drawn into drugs. She returns home determined to stay clean, but takes drugs one night and hitchhikes to Colorado.
She drifts, sick and in a stoned fog for months, trading sex for drugs. A priest calls her parents and she returns home again, but the druggie students at her school torment her. One puts LSD into some candy and she has a horribly bad trip, ending up imprisoned in a mental hospital. Home again with no desire to return to drugs, she feels hopeful, but fears returning to school. The story ends with tragedy.
","This book socks readers in the gut. Only parents can decide if they want their children to read GO ASK ALICE; they know their children best, and may wish to read the book themselves before deciding. Clearly, the book is intense: It graphically describes the waking hell into which the main character descends, her heartfelt but futile battles to return home and stay clean, her pleas to God to save her, her trust and love for her family, and her ultimate failure.
Many realistic young adult books use frank language, but none more so than this book. Purportedly based on the real diary of a middle-class, nice teen girl who became a drug addict in the 1960s, this story is nothing short of harrowing -- and that's why it works. Teens who read the book easily sense that it tells the truth.","Parents need to know that this is a no-holds-barred vivid picture of the life of a teen heavily addicted to drugs during the 1960s. Presented as a real-life diary published under the name  ""Anonymous,"" it was actually a cautionary tale written by the late Beatrice Sparks, a therapist and Mormon youth counselor. While some of the scenes and language may feel dated, the book still carries tremendous emotional power and feels authentic. Teen characters are involved in drugs, prostitution, etc., but the shocking reality of this book has been credited with keeping many teens from trying drugs. Though the writing may not be literary, but its truth comes through on every page. The story is riveting -- even reluctant readers will devour it. The book is a powerful way for teens to really experience the tragic consequences of drug addiction.

Each Tiny Spark,Cuban American tween busts stereotypes in appealing tale.,"As EACH TINY SPARK opens, smart, math-and-tech-minded 12-year-old Emilia Torres is living with her Cuban American family in small town Georgia. She sometimes has trouble following along at school due to her ADHD, but gets a lot of support, especially from her computer-genius mom, her strong-willed abuela (grandmother), nd her friend Gustavo. Things are about to change, though, as her mom leaves for an extended business trip to the West Coast just as her Marine dad is returning from his most recent deployment, and seems pretty stressed. He hasn't even acknowledged the videos she made for him while he was gone, and now, rather than hang out with her, he spends all his time in the welding bay restoring a muscle car from the ground up. But as Emilia, who'd much rather build circuit boards with her mom than go dress shopping with her grandma, takes to welding, the two start to rebuild their bond and he dubs her ""Chispita,"" ""little spark."" Meanwhile, change is coming to the town and not everyone's happy about it.
","In mashed-up English and Spanish, this tween hero's tale will have readers cheering her on as she digs for the truth, stands up for herself and her friends, and gets handy with a welding gun. There's lots to love in the characters, the discoveries they make and the ways they develop along the way. A lot of heavy issues are part of the story fabric: culture clash, PTSD, discrimination, immigration, injustice, and sometimes just plain nastiness and ignorance. But with Each Tiny Spark, the love of family and friends is stronger.","Parents need to know that Each Tiny Spark, by award-winning author Pablo Cartaya (Marcus Vega Doesn't Speak Spanish), tells the story of a 12-year-old Cuban American girl growing up in a small nd rapidly changing town in Georgia. Like the author's own daughter, narrator Emilia is dealing with ADHD. As the story opens, her computer-genius mom is heading off on a business trip, her Marine dad is returning from deployment carrying a lot of stress, and her grandmother, whose auto-repair shop is the family's main support, is always bugging her about being a proper mujercita (little lady). There's a lot to like about this lively, loving family as they come to terms with the world and each other. As the story unfolds in English, Spanish, and Spanglish (often with no translation, and readers are expected to figure it out for themselves), Emilia delves into the history of the Atlanta Olympics, the immigrants who flocked there to build the infrastructure, became part of the community, and stayed -- and how, years later, that's shaped the way things are now. There are strong messages of stereotype-busting (Emilia loves circuit boards and welding and hates frilly dresses), friendship, respect, seeing other people's point of view nd being able to understand where they're coming from even when you don't agree.

The Ice Dragon,Beautifully illustrated dragon fantasy is short but intense.,"Adara's always been different from everyone else. She's more comfortable and happy during the cold of winter when most people want to huddle by the fire. When she befriends a rare ice dragon, she decides she wants to leave her home and go live with the ice dragon far away to the north. But war has come to her homeland, and when enemy dragon riders turn on the family farm, Adara has to decide between leaving to live out her dream or staying behind to defend her home.
","THE ICE DRAGON is an engaging, if brief, dragon fantasy. The gorgeous illustrations, along with every aspect of the book's design, including the beautiful illustrated type, are what make it a satisfying experience, given that the story itself is so short and ends rather abruptly.
Dragon lovers, especially elementary and middle schoolers, will be enchanted with Adara and her magnificent ice dragon. The heirloom-quality presentation ensures that it'll be a pleasure to revisit many times.","Parents need to know that The Ice Dragon is a new edition of a story first published in 2006 by famed fantasy author George R. R. Martin. There's some fantasy violence involving dragon battles, a past beating is mentioned, and the father turns to drinking during hard times. Otherwise there's nothing of concern here from the author whose Song of Ice and Fire series inspired the violence- and sex-filled TV series A Game of Thrones. This story's set in the same universe as A Game of Thrones, but it's a different time period and doesn't have any of the same characters.

A New Darkness,Spooky spin-off series introduces a gifted girl apprentice.,"After losing his master in the end of the Last Apprentice series, Tom Ward, only 17, becomes the County's Spook, putting troubled ghosts to rest and fighting forces of the dark. Going it alone isn't terribly easy -- especially when he learns of three girls dead from blood loss, all with terrified looks on their faces. While he tries to get to the bottom of it, he meets Jenny, a 13-year-old seventh daughter of a seventh daughter, who begs to be his apprentice. Tom's very reluctant to talk with her -- Spooks are always male, for starters -- but she convinces him that she knows where the blood-drinking creature lives and can take him to it. What they discover is something the witch assassin Grimalkin warned him about: a Kobalos. And Grimalkin fears he's the first of many to come and try to enslave the whole County. Grimalkin decides to head north to see what else she can find out about the enemy and wants Tom to come along. Tom is reluctant to leave his post, not only out of duty to the County but because he knows that Grimalkin isn't telling him all the danger that awaits.
","There are many reasons Joseph Delaney's Last Apprentice series was incredibly popular, and the good news for fans is that there's more of the same here. The world full of ghosts, witches, and other dark scary stuff is easy to get lost in, and Tom is a great character -- earnest, brave, talented, smart, and very humble. Tom the Spook is still hard at work in A NEW DARKNESS. The darkness in question is quite outside the realm of the usual witches and boggarts, but it's captivating all the same. The better news for girl fans: the addition of a female character who isn't a child-eating witch or suspicious witch assassin. And Jenny brings her own talents to the table. Not much is developed yet, but her power of empathy seems impressive. Overall, little seems fully developed yet. It's one of those series books all too visibly trying hard to save some mystery and excitement for the other books. Readers will get quite a cliff-hanger out of it but will be wishing for more.","Parents need to know that A New Darkness is the start of a trilogy that picks up where The Last Apprentice series left off. It's possible to read this book without reading the other series, but there are many references to past adventures that may be confusing if you haven't at least read the first in the other series, Revenge of the Witch. In A New Darkness, the main character, Tom, is a Spook -- someone who keeps ghosts, boggarts, witches, and other dark creatures in check. So readers should expect to be very spooked when they meet the new darkness in question, a hairy shape-shifting creature that drinks blood. In one scene, he hangs a girl upside down and drinks it through a straw. There are other moments of gore, as well. A witch steals little children, and bones with blood still on them are found in her house; people are decapitated with swords in one-on-one battles; and a giant tentacled creature gets his eyeballs lanced with swords. A big change in this series: The Spook's new apprentice is a girl. None of the other Spooks is willing to train her, but Tom recognizes that times are changing.

Diego,Bilingual text and mini-murals illustrate Rivera's story.,"To convalesce as a child, Diego is sent to the mountains, where he absorbs the magical beauty of the jungle and learns a love of the common people of Mexico. Back home again, he begins drawing, painting, and using color, but when he is sent to a local art school he is bored. He wants to paint the reality of life around him, and so he does. Diego goes on to study art in Paris, but misses Mexico. He loves the frescos he sees in the cathedrals of Italy, and decides to go back home where he spends his life developing murals that depict the lives of working-class Mexicans.
","DIEGO is a bilingual mural of words and illustrations that presents a simple, honest but eloquent introduction to the art of one of the world's most influential muralists, Diego Rivera. The straightforward story is told in both English and Spanish, and the richly colorful mini-murals that accompany the text are a perfect complement. Not everything in Diego Rivera's life and murals is for kids, and Jonah Winter has done a wonderful job of choosing pertinent material without watering down the facts. His text is clear, varied, and to the point; even some more mature material has been put together in a way that will interest kids, yet not overwhelm them.
Kids will also love the colorful, expressive illustrations, which add a heartbeat of richness and passion to the text. Each painting by Jeanette Winter is masterful. Her colors vibrate on the page, and, though small, each framed acrylic design is saturated with the beauty of Mexican folk art and shows an appreciation of the murals that Diego Rivera painted, some of which form the background in the later pages.

It is beautifully illustrated and won the New York Times Best Illustrated Book Award. Though smaller kids will enjoy the art, the book is really better for school-age readers: It features some difficult material (Diego's twin brother dies as an infant, and his art depicts the hardships and violence experienced by the Mexican people through paintings of soldiers shooting workers and revolutionaries blowing up a train), and it introduces readers to the idea that art can be a type of activism (since Diego ""helped the poor people fight their war for equality."")  Because it's bilingual and written simply in both languages, it can offer a valuable vehicle for practicing reading in English or Spanish.

Ferrying planes across Europe for the U.S. military, Rose falls into enemy hands and is soon a prisoner at the notorious Ravensbruck concentration camp. There, she gradually learns about the Holocaust going on in the background; she also befriends a varied group of women, and they help one another survive.
","More about the friendship of the prisoners than the historical events themselves, Rose Under Fire still vividly portrays the mundane and brutal details of concentration camp life.

Some emotional connections are very powerful; have a box of tissues handy.","Parents need to know that Rose Under Fire, the follow-up to the 2013 Printz Honor Book Code Name Verity, delivers more thrilling, heart-wrenching adventures of the young women who helped the Allies by delivering planes across Europe during World War II. Here, teen pilot and poet Rose Justice strays into German territory and is soon a prisoner at the notorious Ravensbruck concentration camp.

Airhead,Freaky life-swap tale with fashion and flair.,"Emerson Watts is trying to get her best friend Christopher to realize she's actually a girl, keep her little sister from becoming a clone of the popular kids, and maybe, just maybe, survive high school. When her mom makes her supervise her little sister's trip to the mega music store, an accident changes her forever -- into someone totally different and someone her best friend and the world will definitely notice.
","This book is a fun ride, made more entertaining by the model-in-the-making herself. Meg Cabot, Princess Diaries author, brings teen readers yet another makeover story -- but here the fantasy twist is that a regular girl gets a model's life after an accident and some much more invasive procedures. Emerson Watts is witty, sensitive, and slightly offbeat -- and her humorous take on her new life keeps the usual fashion and high school cattiness and snobbery in check.
The downside of this teen fantasy is the stretch the author asks the readers to make -- the kind you would usually only make for mad-scientist horror movies. Adding a slight edge is an underlying mystery that feels just sinister enough to keep it from dissolving into a Scooby-Doo caper. A few intriguing loose ends set readers up for more in the series.","Parents need to know that this book covers some questionable medical procedures and discusses the question of when life actually ends.

Not a Box,Bunny uses box to imagine adventures in mind-opening tale.,"Dedicated ""to children everywhere sitting in cardboard boxes,"" NOT A BOX starts even before the actual story begins, as the protagonist bunny drags and pushes his box through the title and dedication pages. After that, each page opposite a drawing of the bunny and his box poses a question, ""Why are you sitting in a box?"" or ""What are you doing on top of that box?"" Flip the page, and you see that the bunny isn't just sitting in a box or standing on top of one; he's actually sitting in a race car or standing on top of a snow-capped mountain. With the stretch of his imagination, he transforms something as simple as a cardboard box into an adventurous situation. In the end, he dismisses the voice that's questioning his prop and travels in his box (a.k.a. rocket ship) into space.
","The cute yet simple line-drawn bunny here transforms his box into a portal of exciting scenarios. He's seen driving in a race car, standing on top of a mountain, riding in a hot-air balloon or a rocket. Although the drawings in Not a Box are nothing to write home about, somehow, out of author-illustrator Antoinette Portis' extreme minimalism, we see just how sweet -- and sassy -- the bunny is.

However straightforward the message is, it's hard to dismiss. What makes Not a Box memorable is the way that it doesn't let you lose your creative grip on the importance of imagination -- and the fact that it's not a good idea to squelch anyone else's imagination, either. Just like the bunny, everyone should get the chance to make it to the moon.","Parents need to know that this award-winning book will delight your kids from start to finish.

"Smek for President!: The Smek Smeries, Book 2","Girl blasts off to alien moon in wacky, wise sci-fi sequel.","Now 13, Gratuity ""Tip"" Tucci is having to make a few adjustments in the wake of her zany, world-saving adventures in The True Meaning of Smekday. For one thing, her mom, the formidable Ms. Tucci, is no longer abducted by aliens, so Tip has to follow a lot more rules. Also, the Boov alien known as J. Lo, Tip's companion for most of the first book, is living with them but having trouble getting along with the locals. Then J. Lo learns that, back on the Boov world, he's being blamed for pretty much everything bad that happened to the Boov in Book 1. So, defying the woman known as Tipmom, the two head to the Boov world in the decrepit car Slushious, now converted to a spaceship. There, J. Lo is soon thrown into a dungeon, and Tip must brave sleazy politicians, flying billboards, people-sucking transport tubes, garbage-disposal facilities, space guns, and lots more if she's to save him. ","Just fasten your seatbelts and hold onto your hats, because Adam Rex is in classic form here. I mean, what can you say about a book whose narrator/protagonist is a 13-year-old with the given name Gratuity, who goes by Tip, whose BFF is a short gelatinous alien who goes by the name J. Lo nd who often converses with a deceased character from a previous installment in the tale? A book that features the unlikely meeting of the pop star and her otherworldly namesake at the Latin Grammys?
Also in classic form is  relentless marketing machine. Smek for President! coincides with the March 2015 release of the movie Home, a somewhat altered version of The True Meaning of Smekday. Just in case you might miss that fact, the book cover features a fetching portrait of the protagonists with the announcement that this is the series that inspired ""Home, Now A Major Motion Picture."" Protagonist/narrator Tip begins her tale with ""Maybe you read some other  book that got the Smekday Invasion wrong, or saw that animated movie they made about it ... "" If you didn't, she brings you up to speed anyway, as the events of the first book play a large role in the second installment of a planned series -- as does a fair amount of foreshadowing.","Parents need to know that Adam Rex's Smek for President! is the follow-up to his 2007 debut, The True Meaning of Smekday (adapted for the March 2015 movie Home). Rex's trademark mix of pure looniness, wild imagination, snarky comments, sudden wisdom, and sweet moments, complicated by oddball parent-child relationships, is in fine form, as protagonist Tip and her alien pal J. Lo take her Chevy-turned-spaceship to Titan, a moon of Saturn, where the inhabitants of J. Lo's world now live. The story combines text and graphic-novel sections nd delivers the goods in letting young readers share more wildly improbable adventures with the unlikely protagonists, complete with messages of family, friendship, and doing the right thing. There's lso plenty of mild, occasionally hysterical butt- and bathroom-oriented humor.

Woods Runner,Page-turner peppered with Revolutionary War history.,"In the wild frontier of Bristish Pennsylvania, 13-year-old Samuel is a ""woods runner,"" or someone who hunts food for his entire settlement. Growing up sheltered by his gentle parents, Samuel feels far from the American patriot war they have barely heard about -- until his village is attacked and burned, leaving neighbors murdered and his parents kidnapped by Iroquois and British Redcoats. Armed with only a knife and a rifle, Samuel uses his forest skills to track the kidnappers. When he learns that his parents, as prisoners of war, are being taken to New York, Samuel sets out into enemy territory.
","WOODS RUNNER is a worthy page-turner, just right for the reader who is ready for a gripping, informational book with some violence. The book offers meaningful characters, true adventure, helpful and interesting historical notes, as well as an epilogue and an afterword.  The story doesn't go into the politics or particulars of the Revolutionary War, yet it sets a tone of learning under the action and in the author's historical notes that pepper the story. Kids will get through this book easily, though it will leave a mark on them. It would also make a good tie-in to a school study of American history.","Parents need to know that this is a war story, and as such, there is violence and sadness. There's gritty war violence (the main character, a young teen, shoots and kills a couple people in self-defense and watches others get killed) but it's never described graphically.  Parents also need to know that this book offers positive characters who are generous and courageous and lots of historical information about the Revolutionary War.

"The Kingdom on the Waves: Octavian Nothing, Vol. 2","Brilliant, brutal sequel set during Revolutionary War.","This sequel to the National Book Award-winning The Pox Party finds Octavian escaping with Dr. Trefusis, with the two making their way into beseiged Boston in 1775. After a stay there filled with privation, illness, and some fleeting moments of happiness, they head south to Virginia to join Gov. Dunmore, who has promised freedom to any slaves who join his army to fight against the rebels. But Dunmore is incompetent -- and only interested in freedom if it helps him win.
","That this is a brilliant historical novel there can be no doubt. Complex narrative structure and sophisticated, often lyrical, language are employed to bring to life an almost forgotten part of the American Revolution from an equally forgotten point of view -- that of the slaves, whom both sides attempted to use, and neither side considered human.
Through nearly 600 pages of misery, illness, violence, and witty philosophical discourse, Octavian's hope for the betterment of humanity remains, in spite of his almost uniformly horrific experiences. This is a dense book, and the literary style will make it a challenge for many teens. Keep a dictionary at their elbows.  ","Parents need to know that this award-winning book is told from the perspective of an escaped slave who fights in the Revolutionary War to gain his freedom. The intense subject matter means that there's plenty of grim, graphic violence -- including hanging, decapitation, rape, and torture. A major character is killed, with his jaw and part of his skull blown off. There are also sexual references, racist attitudes, and swearing.  But through this mature material -- which is written in a dense but lyrical style that will be challenging to teens -- readers will get an incredible story that not only tells of a teen coming of age but also offers a unique perspective on the American Revolution.

Along the way, they have to figure out how to accept themselves, and how to live with being misunderstood.
","CARNIVORES is a tongue-in-cheek riot. Told from the perspective of animals who long for acceptance in spite of their bad raps, the book explores the hilarious lengths to which people (and animals) will go to fit in, rendered vibrantly with mixed-media illustrations that wouldn't be out of place in a graphic novel.

She is contacted by a witch's daemon who asks for her help in finding an alchemist named Makepeace, who can make a potion to heal the witch. But all is not as it seems, as shown whenever they venture out of doors -- every bird in the city seems determined to attack the daemon. Includes a map, brochure, and postcard.

Lyra and Pantalaimon are such compelling characters that fans will enjoy an excuse to spend a little more time with them. Until the much-anticipated next book in the series, The Book of Dust, is finished, this and Once Upon a Time in the North should help to tide them over.
""Everything means something, ... We just have to find out how to read it,"" Lyra says to Pan, and one might wonder if that applies to this book as well. Both the story itself and the puzzling, seemingly extraneous clues the author scatters through the book may be hints about the novel to come. On his Web site, the author coyly says, ""If you look very closely, you may find some clues about the future course of Lyra's story."" So in addition to enjoying the brief plot, fans of the series can have fun poring over the clues and arguing about what it all might mean.","Parents need to know that there is little of concern here, other than one brief fight in which a witch is killed by a swan.

Love in the Time of Global Warming,Compelling apocalyptic survival story with four LGBTQ teens.,"Pen watches her whole family wash away in a wave caused by the Earth Shaker after she runs into the house after their dog. She's on her own for days hiding in her house until scavengers come to steel her food. One scavenger finds her first and helps her escape with keys to his VW bus and talk of a map that will help her on her way. She races to the van and takes off, seeing destruction and piles of bones everywhere. Her search for supplies lands her in a Target guarded by a real, honest-to-goodness giant. She blinds him with scissors and runs for it. Now the giants and their creator, the mad scientist Kronen, want revenge -- but Kronen may also know where her family is. Pen could use all the help she can get to survive long enough to find them. Enter the beautiful samurai sword-wielding boy named Hex; Ez, the sensitive painter; and Ash, the musician and model. Together they work their way to Sin City and Kronen's giant-infested lair.
","LOVE IN THE TIME OF GLOBAL WARMING gets extra kudos for the title alone; it promises to be provocative, especially when you see the author behind it. Francesca Lia Block has never shied away from tough subject matter: see her Dangerous Angels series for proof.
	Here Block has teens already grappling with their sexual identities now wondering how to survive in a harsh new world. And they have strange and new magical powers. And then there are the scary lab-created giants. And the sirens. And so many parallels to The Odyssey that they keep Homer's classic handy as a reference. All those ideas are packed sardine-tight in a surprisingly low page count. This book definitely could have dug deeper into how each teen got a special power, why they were the ones to survive, and why and how the villain went crazy with his giants. By leaving much of this unexplained, those issues become simply the apocalyptic scenery. It's a brutal backdrop that draws four fascinating characters -- unique ones in teen lit -- together in a compelling and touching survival story.","Parents need to know that mature themes abound in Love in the Time of Global Warming, a literary romantic fantasy marketed at mature teen readers. Most notably, the four main characters are lesbian, gay, or transgender (LGBTQ) teens, one having had a sex-change operation. There's a sexual relationship between two characters that includes descriptions of nakedness and mutual masturbation. One character trades sex for freedom, but the sex isn't described. Talk of their past brings up issues of serious drug addiction, family cruelty, and painful searches for identity. Talk of the present brings us to the apocalypse. Now all of the characters' families are either killed in the Earth Shaker, fires, or floods or are missing or captured. Giants attack and eat humans. In one of the only gory scenes, Pen stabs a giant in the eye and blinds him; later, a character loses an eye, but it's not described. There's mature language, including some uses of ""f--k"" in its variations, but it's not constant. Love in the Time of Global Warming parallels Homer's The Odyssey pretty faithfully, and the teens even carry a copy of the book with them to read passages. The main character is also an art history buff, so many scenes are described through paintings she loves.

The Night Diary,India-Pakistan religious conflict drives moving family tale.,"It's the summer of 1947, and 12-year-old Nisha writes letters each evening to her long-dead mom in THE NIGHT DIARY. There's a lot to write: India, where she lives with her father (a doctor), her twin brother, and her grandmother, is about to become independent. But in the process, the place she's lived all her life is now part of Pakistan, where the Muslim majority doesn't want Hindu families like hers around. On the other side of the border, Muslims are faring just as badly at the hands of Hindus, and all along the way both groups, once peaceful neighbors, are feuding and trying to kill each other. As the family flees to safety, Nisha keeps thinking that the fact that her late mom was Muslim ought to make them friends to everybody, but instead it seems just as likely to get them killed.
","Twelve-year-old Nisha's journal of political turmoil and violence in 1940s India sheds light on a turbulent era. It also delivers a strong message of love, family, and kindness when things are at their worst. And despite the decades that have passed, The Night Diary's story, characters, and issues remain timely and compelling today.","Parents need to know that Veera Hiranandani's The Night Diary was named  2019 Newbery Honor Book.

The Third Twin,Gripping thriller skimps on character development.,"Twins Ava and Alexa ""Lexi"" Rios live in an affluent Southern California beach town. And though they look exactly alike, Ava's mostly interested in appearances, boys, and clothes while Lexi is studious, focusing all her energy on getting into Stanford and eventually joining their father's business. Needing someone to blame for broken household items and missing cookies when they were little, the two girls invented Alicia, their ""third twin."" In their teens, Ava and Lexi have brought Alicia back into their lives, going so far as to get a fake ID for Alicia and to use her as a cover to date boys and act in ways they wouldn't normally. For Lexi, in particular, pretending to be Alicia allows her to blow off steam by being bold, brash, and sexy, escaping the stress of an intense course load and always being a good kid. Suddenly, the most recent boys Alicia has dated are murdered. As Lexi becomes a prime suspect, she wonders whether the sister she knows as well as she knows herself could be the murderer. Or perhaps the imaginary third twin isn't so imaginary after all. As she tries to prove her innocence, she spins into paranoia and wonders who in her life she can really trust.
","THE THIRD TWIN has an interesting, compelling premise: Boys who've dated Alicia, the alter ego of twins Lexi and Ava, are murdered, lways after a falling out with one of the girls. All evidence points to one of the twins -- nd maybe even to the one that doesn't exist. The paranoia and fear Lexi experiences is palpable. Lexi is a likable narrator, but the book offers no real character development, and most of the secondary characters are one-dimensional. And for a supposedly smart kid,  Lexi makes a lot of stupid decisions, consistently and constantly. That flaw starts to grate by the end of the book.
The story starts slowly, but at the halfway point it picks up steam and offers a fast-paced whodunit. It's fun to read, especially when you're trying to figure out how all the pieces fit together, and the ending has a surprise twist. But, unfortunately, that twist is a little out of the blue and comes with a rushed explanation.","Parents need to know that The Third Twin is a murder mystery involving twins Lexi and Ava and a fake third sister, Alicia. When the twins were little, they created Alicia to take the fall for their misdeeds. Now teenagers, they have revived the character of Alicia and use her as an alter ego to go out with boys they wouldn't normally date. When the boys start turning up dead, the evidence points toward one of the twins -- or quite possibly to the imaginary ""third twin"" Alicia. Characters lie and sneak out of the house. There are many instances of characters pushing, grabbing, and restraining others. Very little alcohol or drug use. Characters swear (including ""f--k"" and ""s--t"") but not frequently.

Hothead,Hit book teams baseball with lessons on character.,"Connor is the best player on his Little League team, and he is also a nice guy who enjoys playing with his team and practicing skills. But recently, Connor has been getting way too upset whenever he makes a mistake. He tosses his glove, stomps the dirt, and throws the bat -- even hitting his friend. After one too many outbursts, Coach Hammond suspends Connor from playing for a while until he can pull himself together. That's not the only problem Connor has to deal with: Not only is his dad out of work, but a school newspaper reporter is also threatening to put video of Connor's tantrums online. Can he control his anger, face his worries, and apologize to his teammates before the championship game?
 
","HOTHEAD is a fairly predictable and simple baseball story filled with lessons about character. There is enough play-by-play action to keep baseball fans turning pages, and Connor's personal drama will attract other young readers. The writing is clunky and filled with cliches, and the dialogue between kids often seems too mature for their ages. Also, some readers may notice that Connor never actually says the words, ""I am sorry"" to his best friend or teammates after letting them down and even inflicting injury, which may seem out of step with the moralistic tone of the book. But ultimately readers will know that he has learned to control himself thanks to his good heart and the support of the kind people around him.
 ","Parents need to know that this story is written by pro-player and Hall of Famer, Cal Ripkin, Jr. and is the first in a new series about a Little League team. This book focuses on taming a temper, and while there is no real violence, the main character throws his glove and bat (hitting a friend once) and stomps around when he gets angry. Another character is a bully, though he only uses verbal insults. There's a lot of baseball lingo, and parents may want to make sure kids understand what it means to be ""3-for-3 at the plate"" or ""laying down a drag bunt."" Readers will get messages about good sportsmanship, remorse and forgiveness, personal responsibility, compassion, judging, and friendship -- though some parents may be troubled by the lack of female characters. Connor puts his sister Melissa in the category of ""fifteen-year-old girls"" who like to flirt, shop, and buy cheap earrings, and readers never get to know her more than that.

Things That Are,Great author misses the mark with invisibility tale.,"Alicia is thrilled that her maybe-boyfriend Bobby is back from his trip to New York. But William has followed him back. Like Bobby was once, William is invisible, and he knows that Bobby has the secret to controlling the invisibility. But the FBI is also following Bobby to get to William, whom they consider a threat. Their fathers, it turns out, have also been experimenting with invisibility. And Alicia, still struggling with her blindness, doesn't know whom to trust.
","No doubt this book is just a bump in the road for a brilliant author like Clements, but fans may want to skip this one and wait eagerly for the next. Clements starts with whatever you'd call the opposite of an opening hook -- an opening block? Opening shove? Well, whatever, it's nearly 30 pages of dreary exposition.
	It's clear, though, that his biggest mistake was telling this in Alicia's voice, because Alicia is just dull -- she obsesses over minutiae, describes detail in excruciating detail (seriously, seven pages on walking to the library?), worries at length about Bobby's feelings for her, and maunders on and on. There's a little gimmick about a voice she has inside her that questions her, annoys her, and calls her names she doesn't like, but it's more annoying than revealing. This endless interior monologue may be realistic -- maybe this is just like what goes on in a blind teen girl's head -- but in that case we can all be thankful that it usually stays there.
From the Book:
	And sometimes when I'm at the library sitting in my study room, I can feel the books all around me, millions of them. And I picture myself walking among the stacks, and I choose a shelf, any shelf, and I walk along and let one hand bump along the spines. All those silent books. They keep their backs toward me. I stop and pull one from its place, feel the texture of the cover, and I open the book and smell that rich, deep scent of paper and ink and time. And if the book is old enough, and the paper is thick enough, and the letterpress pushed hard enough, I can drift a fingertip across a page and feel the tiny impressions, feel the words resting there. All those silent pages. At the library.","Parents need to know that for a young adult novel there is very little to be concerned with here: one kiss, and a reference to mice being put down a garbage disposal.

"Curse of the Night Wolf: Barnaby Grimes, Book 1","Fun series start, but violence makes it best for older kids.","Barnaby Grimes is a tick-tock lad -- able to traverse the rooftops of a pseudo-Victorian London to deliver messages and run errands with great speed and punctuality. One evening he is attacked on a rooftop by a giant wolf, only barely escaping with his life. Soon after, he meets a doctor who is giving poor people an elixir with some unusual side-effects, and he begins to suspect that the doctor is not as benevolent as he seems.
","If the opening page of this series opener doesn't draw in even the most reluctant of readers, then nothing will. Barnaby is a most satisfying hero -- bright, massively competent, utterly independent, as good with a sword as with a scientific investigation or a bit of detective work. Though his age, both in text and illustrations, is indeterminate, young readers will have fun imagining a life as free and exciting as his. The Dickensian setting adds another layer of fascination; it's a nice combination of mystery, humor, and horror, and the action is well-paced.
While the text size, length, and publisher's recommendation make this look like a middle-grade book, the level of violence is a bit higher than in most stories aimed at 8-year-olds. Some kids will find the violence is too much for them, but upper elementary kids and reluctant middle school readers will think it's a hoot, and look forward to the next installment which, judging by the excerpt at the back of this book, has a Temple of Doom feel to it.","Parents need to know that the violence here is a bit more gruesome than one might expect from a book the publisher says is for kids as young as 8. Wolves rip out people's throats and snap their necks, tear apart horses, and are skinned to make coats. None of this is described in much detail, but it might be too much for sensitive children.

Billy Bones: Tales from the Secrets Closet,"Playfully spooky, cool, and full of imagination.","Billy Bones is a skeleton who lives in the secrets closet at High Manners Manor. Billy's parents organize the secrets, lies, etc., of the Biglum family, and they always have lots and lots to organize. When a new family member moves into the manor, things begin to change. New mysteries pop up, including secrets surrounding his own family. Billy and his new friend Millicent must unravel the mysteries before the evil Sir Biglum can wreak havoc on all their lives.
","BILLY BONES is great fun. It's spooky, cool, and full of imagination. Readers will enjoy hanging out with ghosts, Death -- who's known as ""Uncle Grim"" -- and the sinister manifestations that lurk all over the Biglum home. A series of secrets and mysteries are at the center of this story and author Christopher Lincoln guides his audience through them artfully, teasing and revealing clues at all the right moments.
This is a book that kids will have a hard time putting down. If there was ever a way to bring warmth and likeability to the Grim Reaper, skeletons, and ghosts, this book did it so successfully it feels almost normal to find a skeleton drinking cocoa in the closet. The novel has a good pace and a great message: secrets and lies are always exposed to the light of truth.","Parents need to know that there's a murder and attempted murder in this book.

Miss Nelson Is Missing,Top-notch tale of teacher from the dark side.,"Miss Nelson, a sweet and shrewd teacher who has to deal with a wild class of schoolkids, makes her winning picture-book debut. Harry Allard's wit and James Marshall's illustrations make this top-notch tale of the substitute teacher from the dark side a hilarious hit.
 ","Allard delivers a crowd pleaser with his rowdy students and a substitute teacher that kids love to hate. His deadpan writing style underscores his comedy; school-age kids will be laughing out loud. Marshal's expressive and colorful pen, ink, and wash illustrations escalate silliness levels; he personifies mischievousness in the kids, kindness in Miss Nelson and vileness in Swamp.
The point that runs through the story -- that you ought to treat others with respect and consideration -- is clear yet tactfully unspoken. Along with the jokes, children seem to intuitively appreciate that the story could come true.","Parents need to know that kids will have fun reading this book while they learn the lesson of appreciating others and the value of discipline.

Owen & Mzee: The Language of Friendship,Inspirational story about friendship and eco-action.,"For over a year and a half, Owen the baby hippo and Mzee the Aldabra tortoise have lived together in Haller Park in Kenya. They are inseparable. Even though Mzee had been a loner, and is 130 years old, he took care of the baby hippo, taught him to graze, and so on, which is very unusual for an animal that does not even raise its own young. Now they seen to have developed several ways of communicating with each other, from nips and pokes to actual vocalizations that seem to carry meaning. It leaves the reader to ponder what the future holds for Owen, in particular. But this book is about more than just a special relationship between two unusual animals. It is also an inspirational story about the people who are committed to restoring endangered, and fragile, ecosystems in Kenya, which is why it won the Christopher Award.
","The story of Owen and Mzee is an amazing one in itself, and these authors and their photographer did a wonderful job of capturing it for the rest of us. The writing is informative, not too simple, not too complicated, and the captioned photos are fascinating, and genuine; Nothing is posed here. In one photo the lumbering tortoise walks down a forest path with the hippo by his side, another shows them nestled up together, a string of others show ways they are communicating. This is photo-journalism at its effective best. Though technically this is a sequel to the first book, it does recap the whole story thus far and can be read on its own.
Photographs by photo-journalist Peter Greste give a very realistic and sensitve look into the world of Owen and Mzee. Especially fascinating is the series of photos depicting the various ways the two animals communicate with each other.

Soaring Earth: A Companion Memoir to Enchanted Air,Lyrical free-verse memoir set amid turbulent '60s and '70s.,"SOARING EARTH begins in 1966, as Margarita, the daughter of a Cuban Catholic mother and American Jewish father, is a high school student in Los Angeles. Surrounded by blond surfer girls, her dark looks have set her apart from other students. So she dreams of finding bookish friends and of traveling to faraway places, especially back to her beloved Cuba, where she spent vacations and her grandmother still lives. Margarita has always found joy in writing poetry, but when students in her honors creative writing class make cruel comments about her work, she stops writing and vows that if she ever begins again, she will keep her words secret. In 1968, at 17, she begins college at the University of California, Berkeley, working in the kitchen of a co-op dorm to pay for her room.  She studies Hindi and Urdu and swears off boys -- not wanting to take the chance of getting attached to someone who might be sent to Vietnam. She tutors the children of migrant farm workers and skips the many campus anti-war protests, as taking part might mean missing an exam. Soon, the protests and unrest at Berkeley begin to frighten her and she drops out of school. She drifts, living in a commune in Haight-Ashbury (where she's the only sober resident) and then moving to New York City. In New York, working at a switchboard and living in chaotic conditions, Margarita realizes she's traveled too far from the loves of her childhood: poetry and nature. She returns to Los Angeles in 1970, moving in with her parents and enrolling in community college. There, she starts over, studying botany and geology and finishing her education as an agronomy major at a polytechnic university. And, after long years away, she begins to write poetry again.
","This captivating free-verse memoir shows the political and social upheavals of the 1960s and '70s, seen through the eyes of a teen struggling to find her own identity. Soaring Earth is filled with historical references, and readers unfamiliar with Cesar Chavez, Haight-Ashbury, the anti-war protests, or the Altamont Speedway Free Festival may find it a bit difficult to put Engle's experiences in context. But all teens should find something relatable in her journey (struggles fitting in, making unfortunate dating choices, pressure to experiment with drugs).
Both parents and teens should read the Author's Note at the end of the book, where Engle reveals an unexpected reason for writing her memoir. She wants to encourage readers to find their own paths when it comes to college, assuring them that they can find an inspiring education not just at a big name university but also at a community college, like the one she credits with giving her a new life and purpose.
 ","Parents need to know that as Margarita Engle's Soaring Earth: A Companion Memoir to Enchanted Air begins, the young Cuban American Margarita of Enchanted Air is now a high school student in Los Angeles. Written in free verse and set in the late 1960s and early '70s, the memoir unfolds against a backdrop of great social and political unrest. As she begins her freshman year at UC Berkeley, Engle finds herself struggling to fit in. She sympathizes with the university's anti-war protesters but chooses instead to attend class. Having seen the damage drugs had done to a high school friend, she chooses books and poetry over drugs. Dropping out of the university, she drifts to the communes of San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury and then to New York before rediscovering both herself and her love of writing. While these were often violent times, the few incidents of violence are never vividly described. Engle is the United States' Young People's Poet Laureate, and her coming-of-age story may well be an eye-opener for readers who think poets must have led boring and uneventful lives.

Brazen: Rebel Ladies Who Rocked the World,"Lively, inspiring mini-bios of women who made a difference.","In 29 chapters, BRAZEN: REBEL LADIES WHO ROCKED THE WORLD offers brief stories of women who defied the odds and achieved excellence in their professional lives. Subjects include actor/inventor Hedy Lamarr, art collector Peggy Guggenheim, entertainer Josephine Baker, athlete Cheryl Bridges, and lighthouse keeper Giorgina Reid. Often dismissed by their male colleagues and family members, these women raised their voices to make a better world for themselves and others. Often funny, frequently heartbreaking, these tales of female achievement will surprise and inspire teen readers of any gender.
","Capturing the essence of any person's life in a half-dozen pages is a formidable task, but this collection of mini-bios of rebellious and influential women hits the mark almost every time. In Brazen, author/illustrator Penelope Bagieu mostly follows a nine-panel-per-page format, which occasionally becomes crowded but more often anchors the reader's attention in telling details. Some world-famous and some obscure, the women spotlighted come from a wide array of times, places, and cultures. What they share is a conviction that they can excel in their spheres of endeavor. With an open and inviting illustrative style and a gift for caricature, Bagieu celebrates sisterhood and the great things that can be accomplished through it. Female and male readers alike will respond to the book's humor, scholarship, and cheeky, positive attitude.","Parents need to know that Brazen: Rebel Ladies Who Rocked the World presents 29 illustrated mini-biographies of notable women from throughout history.

From a highly diverse set of backgrounds, each woman displays bravery, resourcefulness, and strength in the face of adversity. Strong language is infrequent and mild (""ass,"" ""balls"").

Snow Spider,Generic fantasy doesn't make much sense.,"When he turns 9, Gwyn's odd grandmother gives him several gifts for his birthday, the first they have celebrated since his sister disappeared four years ago. She says the gifts will help him discover if he has magic powers, like his legendary ancestors, and tells him to give them to the wind. He does, and receives in return a magical spider whose webs open a window into another world. But when he releases an object he was supposed to keep safe, he unleashes an evil power.
","Veteran author Jenny Nimmo knows how to write a story that will keep you turning the pages, but by the end you're likely to wonder what it was all about. Fantasies can fly as far off the beaten track as their authors can imagine, but they have to have some internal consistency and rules that are discernible and make sense. Fantasy may not be real, but it has to feel as if it could be. Nothing here makes sense, or has any obvious reason behind it, and the reader is left with only questions.
 What is magic about these objects? Why does the wind want them? How does the magic work? What happened to Gwyn's sister, why does she come back, why is she changed, why don't her parents seem to mind, why does she have to return again? What is the deal with the supposed evil power, and how does Gwyn know how to trap it? And on and on. This story is pleasant enough while you're reading it, but deeply unsatisfying by the end. Perhaps the sequels explain some of this, but it's all so nonsensical that it's hard to muster up the will to care. This reads like sloppy, tossed-off work from an author who should know better.","Parents need to know that there is a schoolyard fight, and a story is told in which a man mutilates horses with a sword.

Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist,All-nighter turns romantic in fun but racy read.,"In one long, angst-filled night, Nick and Norah meet, make out, discuss their heartbreaks, have a misunderstanding, make up, and make out again. They also see a lot of bands, have some seriously witty conversations, and do a lot of soul-searching.
","You can see why this book would make such a fun movie: It's got two well-defined characters, fast-paced dialogue, plenty of drama, plus a punk NYC backdrop. Having the book take place in one night adds fun energy to the story -- as does having the chapters alternate between Nick and Norah. Chapters often end with a mini-cliffhanger, with the other protagonist swooping in to offer a new perspective -- and the details of their next adventure.
Readers may not always relate to the lives of these two Jersey teens. Norah, for example, the daughter of a wealthy music exec, says ""I could be scoring weed in Tompkins Square Park right now, on my way to a bondage bar on Avenue D, and my parents would only applaud."" And at some point in their long night together, Nick and Norah end up at ""this place where strippers dressed like nuns and did this tease to 'Climb Every Mountain.'"" But, they will have an easy time relating to these two characters who are obviously meant to be together, if they can get past their own heartbreaks and take that leap. Which you know they will, eventually -- sometime in the wee hours of the morning. Romantic teens will likely be willing to stay up all night reading just to see them jump.","Parents need to know that there is constant swearing, including the f-word, the b-word, and some pretty creative combinations. Nick and Norah order virgin cocktails, but Norah's best friend is always drunk, and there are other references to drugs like marijuana and Ecstasy. The characters also mention Krispy Kremes, Oreos, McDonald's, Chuck Taylors, Xbox, and more. There is some pretty passionate kissing and groping between straight and gay characters, plus talk of other sexual experiences. In the end, this is a story about teens who are able to get past their past hurts and trust the instant connection that just may be true love.

They Say Blue,"Dreamy, visually stunning meditation on colors and seasons.","In THEY SAY BLUE, a girl sits on a beach, musing about the color of the sky and the sea, and then thinks, ""What about a blue whale? Is a blue whale blue?"" She knows that an egg yolk is orange, and that the blood pulsing through her is red. A spring day that's gray and rainy seems more hopeful when she comes upon a purple flower. She sheds her winter wear nd reaches her arms up to become a tree that moves through the seasons. When she awakens from a deep sleep, she and her mother look out at the black crows that ""bob and chatter in the field outside ... Tiny inkblots on a sea of sky.""
","This moving meditation on color, seasons, and more of life's wonders opens with seagulls and closes with crows, and the art itself soars. They Say Blue is constructed of childlike questions and sensory observations that ring true to age nd encourage kids to be mindful and open their eyes to the world around them. It takes a fantastical turn when the girl raises her arms like branches, and becomes a tree that passes through spring, summer, fall, and winter.
The text and art work together beautifully to evoke mood, as at the end when the girl's mother parts her hair ""every morning, like opening a window,"" and sunshine yellow streams in past the midnight blues. Most pages feature the girl, but one vibrant spread shows school kids of many races playing together on a playground, and includes one girl who uses metal forearm crutches. The front end papers are sunny yellow, and the back ones are moody blue, and Tamaki's expressive splashes of color convey real emotion throughout.","Parents need to know that They Say Blue by Jillian Tamaki is a visually gorgeous book by a well-known illustrator and graphic novelist. Tamaki won both a Caldecott Honor and Printz Honor (for teens) for the graphic novel This One Summer. Using color as a jumping-off point, a little girl observes the world around her in fresh and thoughtful ways. ""They say the sea is blue, too. It certainly looks it from here. But when I hold the water in my hands, it’s as clear as glass."" Her observations can inspire readers to be attentive and voice their own questions.

Invisible Girl,Searing memoir of growing up in troubled family offers hope.,"Actress-author and mental health advocate Mariel Hemingway recalls her childhood growing up in a famous family with a legacy of suicide, alcoholism, and mental illness. From infancy, Mariel recounts feeling like an INVISIBLE GIRL, desperate for her parents' attention and her two older sisters' affection. Her alcoholic parents are always partying and arguing, and family members escape by various means -- oldest sister Muffet through drugs and flights of fancy (it turns out she's a schizophrenic nd at one point does a stint in a mental institution), Dad through fishing in addition to drinking, and middle sister Margot through an eating disorder, drugs, and eventually a career as a model and actress, for which she changes the spelling of her name to ""Margaux."" When Mariel's 4 (in 1965), the family moves from California to Idaho, where her famous author grandfather, Ernest Hemingway, shot himself to death four months before she was born. Mariel feels awkward and isolated in school -- and is teased for being a rich kid whose name is actually on the school building. But she finds solace in nature, hiking with her dog, skiing, and riding horses. (Of nature she notes: ""No one can make you feel stupid when you're outside in nature by yourself."") Her life changes when her father has a heart attack (but survives) and again when her mother gets cancer (a disease she lives with for 20 years), and Mariel cares for them in ways beyond what she'd already been doing all her young life. The story goes through her first movie role --  break thanks to Margaux -- while she's still in high school.
","Invisible Girl covers territory common to many young-adult novels -- alcoholism, mental illness, suicide -- but it's all the more harrowing knowing this was the author's actual experience. Mariel Hemingway begins the narration in the baffled voice of a very young kid, and she basically maintains that voice throughout, puzzled by the bizarre behavior of the surrounding adults (she often seems like the only sane person in the family) and confusing, sometimes hurtful situations she mostly navigates on her own.
Kids will relate to the typical growing-up dilemmas and incidents, such as being the target of sibling or classmate rivalry, having a crush, and holding hands with a boy for the first time. And readers from troubled families can find hope in the fact that Hemingway survived hers and didn't repeat the familial pattern of substance abuse. The author not only offers a raft of ""Where to Go for Help"" resources at the back with website addresses and phone numbers (such as Alanon, Anxiety and Depression Association of America, American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the International OCD Foundation, the National Domestic Violence Hotline, and so on) but also introduces each topic area in the context of her own experience. She advises kids that if they're going through something like she did or feeing the same way not to keep it to themselves; there are adults and organizations that can help.","Parents need to know that Invisible Girl, by actress, author, and mental health advocate Mariel Hemingway and Ben Greenman, is a harrowing yet hopeful memoir of growing up in a troubled family with a legacy of suicide, alcoholism, and mental illness. Hemingway offers a kid's-eye view of a chaotic, angry family wherein ""nobody's happy,"" charting her journey from infancy through early high school, trying to make sense of the behavior of those around her, from her hard-partying, always fighting alcoholic parents to her older sisters to the mean kids at school. Hemingway briefly mentions the suicide by gunshot of her famous grandfather Ernest Hemingway, her oldest sister's stay in a mental institution, eating disorders (one scene of binge eating followed by purging), obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, the death of a pet, her father's heart attack and survival, and her mother's cancer diagnosis and treatment. Her sister Margot hits her in the mouth with a baseball bat, knocking out her two front teeth. Mentions of drug-taking and lots of scenes of adults drinking, with young Mariel fixing her parents' drinks. One kiss as part of a planned third-grade stunt. Invisible Girl is being published at the same time as Hemingway's memoir for adults, Out Came the Sun: Overcoming the Legacy of Mental Illness, Addiction, and Suicide in My Family.

"Bookmarks Are People Too!: Here's Hank, Book 1",Boy finds smart ways to overcome challenges in fun story.,"Hank Zipzer is nervous about the upcoming second-grade play: Reading the script would be nearly impossible for him. His friends Frankie and Ashley help him prepare for his audition as Aqua Fly. But when his time comes, Hank can't make sense of any of the words in the script and buzzes helplessly. He loses the part to Nick, the class bully, and his teacher creates a new role for Hank as a bookmark. Hank turns his passive role into a scene stealer. Nick's furious and tries unsuccessfully to sabotage Hank. When Nick is overwhelmed by stage fright, Hank recites Nick's lines from memory and saves the play.
","HERE'S HANK: BOOKMARKS ARE PEOPLE TOO! shows that you can't judge a book by its cover; this story definitely has some heart. A routine assignment for most kids is overwhelming for Hank, but he clearly has smarts and talent to spare. Co-author Henry Winkler's books are inspired by his own experience with dyslexia, and he and Lin Oliver have a plucky, creative hero in Hank. Scott Garrett's fun artwork helps bring the characters to life.
Hank enjoys supportive friends and relatives aside from his father, who means well but is a little harsh with his son. The bully character, however, strikes a sour note. Much of Nick's bullying happens in front of adults, who are only minimally responsive. And the taunts go both ways: Hank is just as quick to cut down Nick. When Nick freezes onstage, just as Hank did during auditions, there's no empathy for a young kid with stage fright -- only teasing. This may be a truthful reflection of elementary school, but it's disappointing not to see a better model on how to deal with bullies.","Parents need to know that Here's Hank: Bookmarks Are People Too! by Henry Winkler and Lin Oliver is the first in a series introducing Hank Zipzer, the hero of the Hank Zipzer series for older readers, to a younger audience. In the previous series, which starts with Hank in fourth grade, Hank has learning disabilities, and co-author Winkler has personal experience with dyslexia. But that word is not mentioned in this story, which starts with Hank in the second grade. While Hank struggles with schoolwork, he makes tremendous effort to do the best he can. His father is loving but critical and doesn't give Hank much credit. The book is set in a typeface designed to be especially easy to read.

This Is Where It Ends,Harrowing and heartbreaking story of a school shooting.,"Tyler Browne's mother has died, his father drinks, and he's dropped out of school. On the first day of the spring semester, he returns to his high school in the small Alabama town of Occidental to exact revenge on anyone who may have bullied or slighted him. Four students narrate THIS IS WHERE IT ENDS -- Tyler's sister, Autumn, and her girlfriend Sylvia; his former girlfriend, Claire; and Sylvia's brother, Tomas. Tyler is outraged at Autumn and Sylvia's relationship, mourning the loss of Claire, and determined to even the score with Tomas. As the students and teachers remain trapped in the auditorium, will anyone step up to lead an escape? ","Intense and compelling, this debut novel balances the senseless violence of a school shooting with uncommon acts of courage and compassion by a diverse cast of characters. The students come from a range of ethnic and religious backgrounds (white, Latino, African-American, Christian, Muslim) and sexual orientation.
It's initially a bit difficult to sort out the characters and their relationships to one another, but once that comes together the interweaving of their stories gives insight into how Tyler went from a loving and supportive brother to  remorseless killer.","Parents need to know that the New York Times bestseller This Is Where It Ends, by Marieke Nijkamp, is a brutal and terrifying story of a high school shooting. Taking place in only 54 minutes and told from the perspective of four students, it unfolds in chapters covering one to three minutes. The four, whose lives are all linked to the teen shooter, tell their stories in real time as well as in flashbacks that examine what may have motivated the rampage. Because the novel takes place in under an hour, the violence is almost unceasing, giving the reader few emotional breaks. Dozens of students and teachers are killed or wounded. Many of the shootings are graphically described. Tyler kills both randomly and by singling people out. As for strong language, ""f--k"" is used a few times.

Kill the Boy Band,"Madcap whodunit has strong language, mature sex references.","Obsessed with the boy band the Ruperts, four high school girls get a room in the hotel where the band is staying in Manhattan, hoping to increase their chances of meeting them. After a chance encounter at the ice machine, one of the Ruperts is knocked unconscious and dragged back to the girls' room. If only they could have realized that kidnapping was only the beginning of the trouble they'd get into. To get out unscathed, are they going to have to KILL THE BOY BAND?
","This book is fast-paced, madcap, and hilariously way over the top, so teens who can handle comic exaggeration and some very frank sex talk will enjoy laughing their way through the crazy caper. Think Stephanie Plum meets Weekend at Bernie's. Teens will relate to the four friends' obsession and to the narrator's feelings as events around her spiral out of control. Surprises around every corner, clues, red herrings, betrayals, and a perfect first kiss make it a fun, light read for older teens who understand negative examples.","Parents need to know that Kill the Boy Band is a zany, madcap whodunit about four fangirls who go way too far in pursuit of their boy-band obsession. Best for older teens due to frequent profanity (including ""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" nd made-up, colorful combinations of swear words) nd their occasional use of highly sexualized talk (""I'd swallow"" when talking about a man's attractiveness). A kidnapping, a death, and solving the mystery are the main plot points. There's no gore, but a body fallen from a tall building is briefly described, the kidnapping victim is described tied to a chair, and strangulation is speculated about. There's some food for thought about celebrity and fans' roles in creating or ending it and about fan-type obsession being an age-appropriate exploration of ttraction versus using your talents and energies on something more important than a boy band.

The idea of a little girl and a bear cub each following the wrong mother appeals to preschoolers' sense of humor. But beyond the entertainment value, the story provides some lessons for children.

The Doldrums,Imaginative illustrated tale of quirky friends' adventures.,"Growing up in Helmsley House, surrounded by exotic stuffed animals and other souvenirs of his explorer grandparents' travels, 11-year-old Archer B. Helmsley knows he's destined for similar adventures, but his parents are having none of it. When word comes that the grandparents have been carried off by an iceberg in Antarctica, Archer's mom seizes the excuse to confine him to the house lest he suffer the same fate. But adults are no match for what happens when he meets two other friendless kids: Oliver, mocked and ignored by his classmates, and wooden-legged Adélaïde, just arrived from Paris. Buoyed by mutual support, the three are soon determined to rescue Oliver's grandparents. What could go wrong?
","Suspense, slapstick, appealing characters, and wild situations abound in author-illustrator Nicholas Gannon's imaginative foray into tween angst and off-the-chart adventure. Plentiful color illustrations, in a retro sepia-tinged palette, set the scene and the tone, bringing Archer, Oliver, Adélaïde, and the notably strange Helmsley House to life. Some kids may be put off by such creepy elements as wooden legs, glass eyes, and the like or find the narration a bit self-consciously talky in places, but rarely have so many positive messages -- from the importance of friendship, perseverance, and confronting your demons to a shout-out to beleaguered parents trying to make the right choices for their kids -- been presented with such subversive glee. Take, for example, Adélaïde, who on the first day of school deals with the teacher who has her classmates terrorized:
""'In France,' said Adélaïde, facing Mrs. Murkley once more, 'they tell us to be mindful with those who dictate head placement because these could be the same people who someday tell you to stick it in a guillotine.'
""'You'll stick your head where I tell you to stick it!' Mrs. Murkley demanded. 'In a guillotine or wherever! If you don't, there will be consequences!'
""Adélaïde nodded. 'But,' she said slowly, 'what consequences would be worse than sticking my head in a guillotine?'""","Parents need to know that The Doldrums, an appealing, oddball tale from first-time author-illustrator Nicholas Gannon, mixes subversive sweetness with a good dose of Dahl-esque comic creepiness. Set in a retro, early 20th-century neighborhood, it's poignant, wacky, and uplifting by turns as three friendless 11-year-olds find one another and embark on hair-raising adventures. It's all part of a plan to dodge terrifying authority figures and rescue one kid's grandparents, who've gone missing in Antarctica. One of the kids has a wooden leg due to a childhood mishap; another's prized possession is a glass eye that belonged to a seafaring friend of his grandparents; nd his friendship with an assortment of taxidermied animals plays a key role in plot developments. Since they're not really allowed to do much of anything, the kids regularly disobey their parents, sneak off to bad parts of town in search of information, and plan to escape to the South Pole during a school trip to the local museum. Through all the crazy developments, kindness, friendship, and truth triumph, though not always as planned.

P Is for Pterodactyl: The Worst Alphabet Book Ever,Wacky alphabet book pokes fun at silent letters and more.,"P IS FOR PTERODACTYL is unlike any alphabet book you've seen before. It highlights words that begin with silent letters or contain them. And it not only says what words the letters are for (like ""C is for Czar""), but also, in some cases, points out what they're not for, as in ""F is not for Photo, phlegm, phooey, or phone."" It also gets into homonyms, like see and sea. On the ""O is for Ouija"" page, we see a leopard wearing a red beret playing with a Ouija board, two kids, and a tiny witch. Below the picture the sentence reads, ""The French leopard says, 'Oui! We'd love to play Ouija with the wee witch from Oaxaca.'""
","This unconventional alphabet book makes a great read aloud and will open kids' minds to the crazy world of words and spelling. Reading P is for Pterodactyl aloud is a must for younger kids, given amusing but complex sentences like: ""The tsunami washed away all of Tchaikovsky's chintzy tchotchkes,"" which appears below a cartoon-like illustration of a giant wave about to crash on the classical composer and his piano. A fun twist on the lphabet book structure is having some entires that tell readers what a letter is not for, as in ""U is not for You,"" and Y is not for Why.""
Amid all the humor, wordplay and silliness, there's solid, brain-teasing information about words and how they're spelled. It a delight from start to finish, especially for word lovers and their offspring. But many words (like euphoric and eulogy) and sentences are challenging and may require grown-up assistance/explanation. There's also is a handy glossary at the back.","Parents need to know that P Is for Pterodactyl shows kids lots of English words that are hard to spell (or pronounce) because they begin with silent letters, like pterodactyl, aisle, knight, and knot, or have silent letters in them.

"Lady Smoke: Ash Princess, Book 2",Warring kingdom sequel not as compelling as Book 1.,"In LADY SMOKE, Theodosia and Soren are picked up by the pirate Dragonsbane's ship after their escape from Soren's father, the Kaiser. Dragonsbane has a plan for Theo to win back Astrea from the Kaiser: marry her off to an eligible leader with money and troops to fight him. Theo isn't thrilled -- by tradition, Astrean queens do not marry -- but is willing to meet suitors and decide. So they sail to the desert kingdom of Sta'Crivero where King Etristo has gathered numerous royal suitors for a price. The kingdom is modern and affluent and Theo begins to get caught up in the spectacle of being on display in ball gowns. But that all changes when she visits her Astrean people in the refugee camps. People are starving and stuck behind walls unless they're called upon for cheap labor. That prompts Theo to decide on a suitor who can help save her people. But moments before she can extend an offer, her best prospect is poisoned in front of her.
","With far too much reflection and dialogue and far too little immediate action, this sequel fails to maintain the same visceral, absorbing energy as the first book. This sophomore effort of author Laura Sebastian falls into all the sequel traps, the worst being a long wait to the final action. Theo sits in a foreign palace not wanting to get married for hundreds of pages. When she gets out among her people in the refugee camps, she's moved to action, but so slowly that the reader will know what the plan should have been a whole lot sooner.
Lady Smoke is also slowed down by its main character's lengthy reflections. Many of this commentary feels redundant, as it's shown through the actions of the characters. The rest should have been shown this way to pull the story forward. It's so much better to show than tell, and it adds an immediacy for the reader. And when we get to the end, the expected battle, readers are also watching from a distance. Let's hope Sebastian comes back to the excitement she found in Ash Princess for her final installment.","Parents need to know that Lady Smoke is the second in the Ash Princess fantasy series. The intensity of the first volume is toned down here. There are deaths from assassinations -- from poison and fire -- and throats are slit on the deck of a ship, but all battle-style action is seen from afar. Readers of Ash Princess will remember how Theodosia lost both her parents and was tortured by the usurper king for 10 years, and how her people were subjected to torture and genocide. Other mature content includes some kissing and sleeping in the same bed and 16-year-olds getting drunk on wine. We see the difficult lives of Astrean refugees in Lady Smoke and how a kingdom with great power and wealth starves them and treats them as ""bad luck"" and other. Those with little power, but who have known suffering are the ones determined to help them.

Juana & Lucas,Colombian girl learns English in fun early chapter book.,"In JUANA & LUCAS, Juana describes her life in Bogotá, Colombia, where ""the air feels clean and delicious, and smells like fresh fruit and bread."" Juana has a happy, cosmopolitan life with friends and family, though at school she struggles with math and fears the parent-teacher conference. Things take a turn for the worse when a teacher introduces English class. Juana asks a series of adults why she should have to learn English, and they all present different reasons. But when her abuelo promises her a trip to Spaceland in Orlando, Florida, she gets the motivation she needs. By the end, she's jabbering in English with anyone who'll listen: ""Because I can speak English so well, I've been able to have fun with a lot of people and make a lot of good friends. And who wouldn't like for that to happen all around the world?"" Exactly!
","For readers who are graduating to chapter books but still like their art full-color, this book, which seamlessly incorporates easy Spanish vocabulary, is muy fun. Juana & Lucas by author-illustrator Juana Medina is narrated by a schoolgirl from Bogotá, Colombia, a likable, relatable character who's strong-willed and funny. Juana's life in Bogotá isn't so different from middle-class life in the U.S., and the story's full of cozy foreign detail. For instance, though Bogotá's temperate by day, it's colder at night, ""so everyone always keeps a pair of slippers by their bed.""
Medina displays a lyrical touch when conveying her love of the city. Looking out at the lights at night ""looks as if the city is wrapped in a blanket of stars."" She's also funny, pulling some information directly from the narrative to illustrate Juana's strong opinions about topics that range from why she hates her uniform to why she loves her dog, Lucas, and her enviably big web of friends and family. Much of the humor stems from her trying to learn a foreign language. When her teacher tells the class they're going to learn ""the English,"" Juana gets a paper cut and cries out, ""Ayayay!,"" but the teacher corrects her: "" ... in English it's Ouch!"" This inviting book gives readers a very happy glimpse of a young girl's life in a cosmopolitan Latin American city.","Parents need to know that Juana Medina's award-winning Juana & Lucas is the first book in a new chapter-book series set in Bogotá, Colombia, that seamlessly incorporates Spanish vocabulary. Illustrated with lots of full-color art nd told in 11 short and breezy chapters, it's perfect for kids making the transition from beginning-to-read books to chapter books. The sprinkle of Spanish adds flavor to the story nd is a snap to understand. Many words are close cousins with English; for instance, Juana visits neighbors in their apartamento nd describes something as fantástico. But Medina always keeps it simple and clear from context: ""I already know plenty of songs to cantar in Spanish."" With an opinionated, funny narrator; her cute dog, Lucas; brimming bookshelves in every home; and a best friend who's a different race, Juana & Lucas introduces readers to a character who feels like a fun new friend.

We Were Liars,A privileged life goes askew in haunting summer mystery.,"Cadence Sinclair Eastman spends summers on her family's island near Martha's Vineyard. Yes, her family has an entire island, where each of Harris Sinclair's three daughters has a house. The kids who populate these houses are cousins and cohorts; the oldest posse of the cousins call themselves the Liars. Her parents' dramatic divorce leaves Cady with horrible migraines. She finds comfort at Beechwood Island with her cousins, particularly with a stepcousin named Gat. The Sinclair family begins to fracture, as the aunts vie for their share of the inheritance, and the Liars decide to take matters into their own hands.
","It's the kind of story many kids dream of playing a role in -- golden sunsets on a private island, a tight-knit family, funny and cool kids -- but the characters aren't developed enough to be loved. In fact, readers never get a real sense of why the kids earned the name Liars. The half-sentences and lists provide a poetic tone, lending a smart edge to a mysterious narrative, but the meat of the story, the bond between the Liars themselves, is not entirely clear. Although the drunken family members are supposed to be pitied, they're simply too aloof to provoke compassion. The references to King Lear re obvious to the point of being redundant.
E. Lockhart writes with confidence about upper-crust life on the East Coast (""The Sinclairs are tall, athletic and handsome...Our smiles are wide, our chins square, and our tennis serves aggressive""). And there are moments where the island comes to life in beautiful, nautical colors. Moreover, the plot twist ends up revealing something truly shocking, and it makes reading the novel worth the effort. But whether We Were Liars succeeds in making the reader really care about its characters' fate is another question.","Parents need to know that National Book Award finalist E. Lockhart's We Were Liars is a mystery involving privileged families at their summer retreat near Martha's Vineyard. Violence lurks beneath the golden life that Cady and her family enjoy on Beechwood Island, and there's an accident that causes death. Arguments, feuds, and revenge are fueled by questions of who will inherit the Sinclair fortune. Sex (kissing, sensual exploration), drinking, drug use (a pain killer), and language here are pretty tame compared with other books for teens. Swearing includes ""bulls--t,"" ""s--tty,"" and ""f--k"" and its variations. ",13,13,13,E.

"The Necromancer: The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel, Book 4",Popular fantasy series has lots of plots to keep track of.,"Five or so narrative threads co-exist in THE NECROMANCER, the fourth installment of the Nicholas Flamel series. Twins Sophie and Josh are back in San Francisco with the Flamels, where they encounter Scathach's twin sister, Aoife, who is desperate to find her sibling. The rapidly aging Flamels -- gearing up for a fight with the scary creatures on Alcatraz -- decide to take Josh to Prometheus to learn the Magic of Fire. Meanwhile, Dee is fleeing London after a warrant of sorts is issued for him by his Dark Elder master. He enlists the help of Virginia Dare to reach San Francisco and begin his world-domination plans. Scathach and Joan of Arc are stuck in another time and place (one that's full of hungry prehistoric beasts), while Joan's husband, Saint-Germain, seeks out the Saracen Knight and Shakespeare in hopes of finding a way to reach her. Not to be left out, Machiavelli and Billy the Kid escape Alcatraz and come face to face with a Dark Elder who won't accept any more excuses -- the beasts on Alcatraz need to be set loose on the city, and soon.
","If you can't follow the book summary above, you already know that skipping ahead in this series just isn't an option -- too many characters populate this world. It combines historic figures as immortals, gods of the past as Elders, older beings called Archons, whole shadowrealms parallel to our world, and magic that binds everything together. In fact, it will probably help to re-read the third book to keep up with this one. If readers love the characters, they won't mind the split-screen viewing of all their revelations here. But Josh is tougher to love -- it's not clear why he's so suspicious of Flamel but not nearly wary enough of Dee. Perhaps he'll find a way to redeem himself. ...
Splitting the story also splits the action ... and wrecks some of the momentum. At least all the complex storylines are worth following, and that's what will keep the pages turning. There are the occasional flashbacks to whole other eras, however, that are enough to make an impatient reader exclaim, ""let those beasts loose on San Francisco already!"" When -- well, if -- that happens, then the series will go beyond ""pretty intriguing"" right into ""riveting"" territory. ","Parents need to know that the books in the epic Nicholas Flamel series, like the Percy Jackson tales, will get kids immersed in and learning about mythology. Like its predecessors, the fourth tale in the series mixes in some historical figures (Joan of Arc, John Dee, Shakespeare, etc.) as immortals. There's some fantasy violence, mostly involving attacks from beasts, both mythological and prehistoric. A major positive theme involves what characters will do to protect and be with the ones they love.

If I Grow Up,"Very violent, stereotyped look at life in the 'hood.","DeShawn lives in the projects in New York City. There are few opportunities for success; teens regularly join gangs and sell drugs, and gunshots are more frequent than bird songs. DeShawn is a smart kid who knows the gang and drug life can only end in tragedy, but how can he stand by and watch his family starve?
","This is a painfully one-dimensional novel that could be used as a script for any after-school special, crime drama, or urban movie. When a book is set in an urban setting where poverty, poor choices, and lack of opportunity are prevalent, critics tend to call the book ""gritty."" However, many of these books only feed off of press snippets and writer imagination of what the 'hood' is really like, and so the stories lean closer to stereotypes of urban life. This novel, unfortunately, is no exception.
Stock characters -- the hard working grandma, the knocked-up older sister, the good kid struggling to stay out of trouble while enduring peer pressure and oppressive poverty -- are all in place here, as well as stock ghetto situations like eating cereal with water, multiple sex partners, pregnancies, lack of male responsibility, and blinged-out dope dealers that are anti-heroes to the residents. Add in a couple of drive-bys, double crosses, and a smidge of regret, and it really misses the mark.","Parents need to know that this book contains heavy violence and strong inner-city stereotypes and cliches.

"Hi, Cat!","Comic, engaging portrayal of persistent feline.","""... and all I said was, 'Hi, cat,' said Archie."" The curious feline follows Archie and disrupts an impromptu sidewalk performance by two boys and a dog. Ezra Jack Keats's uproarious illustrations capture the legendary inquisitiveness of cats in this exuberant and very funny tale.
 ","Much of the action is effectively played out in the pictures here; words are not necessary to explain the inevitable reaction when Willie and the cat spot each other. An eloquent series of wordless illustrations perfectly convey that still moment of awareness and, a mere split second later, the leap into action.
Liberal touches of humor keep readers rolling with laughter. Young children enjoyed searching for the curious cat, which is subtly included in the backgrounds of many of the innovative collage illustrations.

Death Sworn,Solid fantasy whodunit has lots of intrigue and magic.,"A test has proven that one day Ileni, 17, will lose her magical powers, which means she can no longer live with the Renegai, the sorcerer community in which she grew up. As part of a long-standing treaty with the assassins she's sent to their hidden enclave to teach them spells that will help them on their killing missions. The two previous magic teachers have been murdered in the span of a few months, and as Ileni feels her powers waning she knows that she could be murdered at any moment. But she's determined to find out how and why her predecessors died for the sake of helping the Renegai, even though she knows it will be the last thing she does.
","DEATH SWORN is the third novel from Leah Cypess, and she's hit her stride here. She successfully creates a tense, oppressive atmosphere in the assassins' caves; the characters are well developed and believable; the mystery is intriguing and the solution takes almost as many twists and turns as the winding underground fortress itself. The ending is satisfying but leaves the door open for a sequel.
The writing never really soars, but it's solid, and kids who like mystery, intrigue, and magic will enjoy rooting for the heroine Ileni as she tries to solve the case -- and stay alive.","Parents need to know that for a murder mystery that takes place in an assassin training academy, Death Sworn has relatively little violence. Sure, murder and death are major topics, but there's no gore. A climactic confrontation ends with a throat slashing that's bloody and briefly described, and a dead body's described with some blood mentioned but no other gory detail. Sex is confined to a couple of kisses. A heavier make-out session and the possibility of sex are hinted at, but nothing's described or specifically mentioned as having happened. Students of varying ages from pre-teen to young adult at the assassin academy drink wine at celebrations.

The rest of the book is one day in the life of Sophie's family, with times given for getting up, going to school, Dad's appointment, meals, and activities. It ends with everyone going to sleep.
","This is an anomaly in the series: Felix doesn't travel, there are no letters or other surprises, and it's printed in board-book format with a circular cutout that allows a toy clock to show through. Unfortunately, the pages do not refer to the clock, so its usefulness is limited. The book is intended to teach telling time, but its presentation is confusing and at too high a level for the age at which most kids learn to tell time.

Babar and the Ghost,Good for kids too young for emotional suspense.,"Hiking with their friend, the Old Lady, Babar and family decide to take refuge from a rainstorm in the Black Castle, which is reputed to be haunted. There, the kids encounter the friendly ghost, Baron Bardula, when they run off to explore the castle after the adults fall asleep.
After the baron shows them around the castle and regales them with stories of long ago, the children--who can see the ghost, although others can't--invite him to follow them back to Celesteville.
Upon the elephant family's return to the palace, mysterious things begin to happen: A lemonade pitcher floats in the air, and Arthur is pushed through the park in a shopping cart by an invisible hand. But when the ghost disrupts school and Celesteville's traffic, it's time for him to go back home.
","This is a good-natured and well-meaning book, ideal for parents who are being hounded for a ghost story by children too young to handle emotional suspense. Laurent's pictures are not as detailed or compelling as his father's, but in the end he succeeds in his lifelong effort to keep Babar live in children's minds.
Laurent de Brunhoff grew up listening to his mother's stories about a small elephant that his father, Jean, turned into Babar, one of the most solid icons of children's literature. Jean began publishing his stories late in life, and it fell to Laurent to keep up the family tradition. This tale, however, lacks the characterization and plot twists you might expect from Jean's stories, and standing alone as a ghost story, even without Babar's family, it lacks the suspense and thrills American children have come to expect from the genre.","Parents need to know that this story teaches children that one can overcome fear by encountering its not-so-scary source.

Her friends, both Muslim and Christian, support her choice, but she still deals with negative consequences at school and in the community. Amal's close relationship with her parents contrasts with her friends': Leila's mother is determined to marry her off at 16; Simone's mom tells her to diet because she's fat; Adam's mother deserted him. With her attention-attracting hijab and her policy against dating, Amal tries to find the line between social acceptance and assimilation as she grapples with adolescence and her ""hyphenate"" identity as an Australian-Palestinian-Muslim girl.
","Abdel-Fattah, who describes herself as ""an Australian-born-Muslim-Palestinian-Egyptian-chocoholic,"" gives voice to girls underrepresented in literature and the popular media. Readers will learn more about Islam's religious practices and beliefs, but to the extent that some dialog exchanges seem awkwardly set up in a question-and-answer format. Amal's behavior is full of contradictions as she learns that wearing the hijab is symbolic; She eventually realizes she must also change what's inside to truly reflect her religious values.
Western feminists may struggle with Amal's assertion that wearing the hijab is ""liberation"" from body-image issues. Readers of different faiths will admire her determination to be true to her beliefs and identify with her strong friendship bonds. Overall, it gives teens of every faith and background a great chance to see another perspective and discuss prejudice and identity.","Parents need to know that the Muslim main character, Amal, who lives in Australia, faces religious and racial prejudice, including kids on the playground who tell the ""darkies"" to go home. She gets frustrated trying to explain that every Muslim is not a terrorist.

Until one day, when the cook falls ill and the duchess’ guests scramble to prepare an exotic feast, and the earl’s humble, sensible grilled cheese sandwich draws her attention. The two share the sandwich and find they have much more than tastes in common once they finally start talking.

Just One Year,"Powerful, brooding tale of confused guy from Just One Day.","JUST ONE YEAR revisits roughly the same time period of Just One Day, starting from the crucial morning when Willem does not return to Lulu after their life-changing, 24-hour adventure in Paris together. Injured, hospitalized, and temporarily without short-term memory, Willem can't recall where he was or who he was with until it's too late and a devastated Lulu (Allyson) has already fled back to London. Willem reluctantly returns home to the Netherlands for family business. Forced to confront his issues with his grief, his distant mother, and his out-of-the-loop friends, he can't forget that fateful day with Lulu, a girl unlike all the others he'd connected with in his years of escape-driven travel.
","Readers who can get past expecting another Where She Went will find a lovingly crafted account of the way some relationships stick with you forever and of how a guy becomes a man.
For the second time, Gayle Forman revisits a romance from the guy's perspective. In Where She Went, Adam knew nearly everything about Mia, the love of his life who almost died and then enigmatically broke up with him. Here, Willem doesn't even know Lulu's real name and only remembers one full day of intense connection. Hence Just One Year becomes less a story of reunion than of Willem's journey of self-discovery as he tries to understand why he travels so much and why he can't truly commit to any interested women.
Just One Day reveals that Willem and Allyson will meet again, but Forman here focuses less on the romantic reunion than on the journey back home, however defined: a place, a person, or the realization that there are people who love you. It's a powerful story but more brooding and resentful than Forman's previous work. ","Parents need to know that Just One Year, the companion novel to author Gayle Forman's romantic young-adult novel Just One Day, covers the same time period as the first book but from the perspective of Willem, Allyson's enigmatic Dutch love interest. Reflecting Willem's age (20) and edgier lifestyle, Just One Year has more violence and sex than Just One Day: Willem suffers a vicious attack that leaves him unconscious; more sexually experienced than Allyson, he often recalls encounters with past lovers. Characters drink and smoke, including hash/pot (legal in the Netherlands). As in Just One Day, there's plenty of strong language (""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""bitch"").

Would You,Poignant story about a car accident's aftermath.,"Natalie plans to spend the summer working as a lifeguard, hanging out with her friends, and preparing to miss her idolized older sister, Claire, who is leaving for college. But everything normal suddenly ends when a car accident leaves Claire hospitalized in a coma. Natalie wonders how she can cope, when the person she most wants for support is her big sis.
\
The \""would you\"" game Natalie plays with her friends -- asking questions like \""Would you rather lose all your hair or all your teeth?\"" -- turns somber: \""Would you rather just die, or be alive and seriously brain damaged?\""
","It's easy to be deceived by this slim novel, either by appearance (a light read, divided by subtitles into brief vignettes) or by subject (a depressing story about death). It is, in fact, neither light nor depressing, but heartbreakingly realistic, with devastating insight into how one teen endures a tragedy. Eleventh-grader Natalie and her friends are believable teens, with true-to-life dialog and situations (as Natalie notes about her friend, who works at their hang-out restaurant, ""It bites to wait on your friends."").The author never veers into saccharine or falls for easy solutions. She finds exactly the right note even at the end, which isn't happy or sad: It just is what it is. ""If you stick a hopeful ending on there, it'll be a total lie,"" Natalie says. There's no message about drunk or irresponsible driving; it's a pure accident on all accounts, despite the family's wish for someone to blame. Natalie's engaging narration (the private room at the hospital is ""really just the Bad Effing News Room"") helps her -- and the readers -- bear the unbearable. As she tells her comatose sister, ""Even fathers break. It started with you, Claire, the one broken person. But there is never only one broken person.""","Parents need to know that this novel deals with a teen getting hit by a car and ending up in a coma, and how this impacts her family. The topic of death is handled sensitively and realistically, but it may disturb some readers. Characters talk like real teens, which means some cursing and irreverent discussions. Teens trespass to swim in backyard swimming pools (presented as a fun thrill); there are brief mentions of teen sex (in a committed relationship); and alcohol use by teens.

"The Creeping Shadow: Lockwood & Co., Book 4",Consistently great ghost series keeps the scares coming.,"In THE CREEPING SHADOW, after leaving Lockwood & Co., Lucy starts work as a freelance ghost-catcher. With her talent to actually hear the ghosts she captures getting stronger all the time, she's in high demand at all the other agencies -- in such high demand that Lockwood comes knocking on her door asking for help with a particularly malevolent ghost, a cannibal during his life. In fact, Penelope Fittes herself, from one of the top two agencies dealing with ""The Problem,"" as they call it, asked for Lucy specifically. Lockwood and Ms. Fittes both try to convince Lucy, and she's torn. She gave up Lockwood & Co. because she saw a vision of Lockwood getting hurt because of her. In the end she decides that one freelance gig couldn't hurt. After the very dangerous job is done, Lucy is ready to get back to her independence. But that's not to be. She goes home to find her apartment ransacked and a valuable ghost jar gone -- it's a Type 3 spirit she can talk to that often helps her on cases. Her determination to track down the culprits puts her in serious danger, leaving her no choice but to seek help the one place she's trying to avoid: Lockwood & Co.
","If you love the other books in this deliciously creepy and slyly humorous series -- as any fan of ghost stories should -- you'll dig right into this fourth installment. The characters, especially Lucy and Lockwood, remain vibrant in The Creeping Shadow and continue to grow their ghost-catching talents. Lockwood is as cocksure as always and here reveals both more of a reckless side and a bigger soft spot for Lucy. In fact, the Lucy-Lockwood partnership has a real X-Files Mulder-Scully vibe to it. They're so obsessed with their work they'll never know they're perfect for each other.
Along the same X-Files lines, there's an undercurrent of conspiracy throughout. Where did ""The Problem"" come from? Did certain players in the ghost-catching business make it worse? What do they know? What are they hiding? It all adds an extra intriguing layer to all the excitement of chasing some truly frightening ghosts. The Creeping Shadow creeps one tiny step closer to figuring out the cause of all these hauntings -- but luckily not too close. Readers have more time and more volumes to enjoy in this consistently great series.","Parents need to know that The Creeping Shadow is the equally scary sequel to The Screaming Staircase, The Whispering Skull, and The Hollow Boy. The publishers recommend the whole series for middle-grade readers, but we still say the ghost-hunting series is a better fit for kids just getting into young adult literature, at age 11 and up. The book is over 400 pages, and the writing is more descriptive and dense than most middle-grade books. Plus, readers must like scary stuff: eyeless ghosts with bloody sockets, a cannibal ghost who hid the bones of his victim around his house, a ghost only visible in mirrors. All those who subdue ghosts for a living are kids or teens because they have ""the sight."" Lucy, the narrator, can even hear the ghosts talking to her. All the main characters are extremely brave and selfless, as well as reckless at times, and pride themselves on working together as a team. When they fight against bad guys in the land of the living, a teen boy dies from a snapped neck, a man is pushed into a mass of ghosts and dies, a girl gets an injury from a thrown knife, and many get burns from magnesium flares.

The three 11-year-old girls become inseparable for the next two years, bonding over Tupac Shakur's music. Then everything changes when Tupac is killed and D Foster's real mother takes her away. ","This story of friends united by their love of music has the power to open minds and bring together readers of vastly different experiences. One of the many purposes of literature is to let readers see themselves in the characters nd see how people like them deal with the joys and difficulties of life. Many young readers will find themselves on the pages of AFTER TUPAC AND D FOSTER. Author Jacqueline Woodson depicts a time, a place, and a friendship that all feel very real, and she uses the device of their love of rapper Tupac Shakur to make their experience universal. Any kid who has loved Shakur, or any musician, and used that person or group's music to help them figure out and get through their lives, will relate.
Another purpose of literature is to expose readers to lives different from their own, to open closed minds and broaden experience. Hanging her story on Shakur allows Woodson to accomplish both purposes. Tupac Shakur was one of those figures who divided America into two mutually uncomprehending groups -- those who loved him and found personal meaning in his work, and those who dismissed him as just another posing thug who reaped what he sowed. Woodson opens up the world of the former group to the latter, who, after reading this, may want to reassess their hasty judgments nd perhaps learn more.

What is the source of the screams that emanate from the basement, and what secret procedures are performed on unwitting patients? These are only some of the mysteries that must be solved before Ricky can hope to make his getaway.
","Sometimes a prequel to a popular series can add something enlightening to what's gone before, but this supposedly stand-alone volume doesn't offer much for the interested newcomer. In Escape from Asylum, Ricky, Kay, Nurse Ash, the warden, and the other denizens of Brookline are interesting characters, but they are also somewhat static.

The Upside of Unrequited,A sweet and funny story about finally finding first love.,"Set in the progressive Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C., THE UPSIDE OF UNREQUITED chronicles the summer story of 17-year-old Molly Peskin-Suso, who has had 26 unrequited crushes. A self-proclaimed ""prolific crusher,"" Molly considers herself the opposite of her fraternal twin sister, Cassie: Whereas Cassie is blond, blue-eyed, and slender, Molly is brown-haired, brown-eyed, and fat. And while young lesbian Cassie has hooked up with plenty of girls, Molly has never even kissed any of the 26 guys she's crushed on. Things begin to change when Molly finds herself with two possible suitors: ""hipster Will,"" a handsome ginger who's best friends with Cassie's new girlfriend, and big-and-tall ""Middle-earth Reid,"" who works with Molly in his parents' eclectic home goods store. But while Molly realizes Will is objectively ""hotter,"" she finds herself increasingly attracted to geeky and adorkable Reid.
","This touching novel about sisterhood, family, body image, and first love is further proof that Becky Albertalli is a powerful voice in contemporary young adult literature. In The Upside of Unrequited, Molly has, by all accounts, an amazing life: two loving moms who adore each other and their three children; a fierce twin sister; a cute baby brother; lifelong friends who have her back; a cool multicultural neighborhood; and a fun summer job. But she's consumed with a sense that's something's lacking, because she's never actually been in love. Sure, Molly's had the epic 26 crushes, but they were all from afar and unrequited (she barely spoke to the objects of her crushes). Through Molly's journey of discovering what falling in love feels like, Albertalli has given voice to a character so often ignored and pushed into the jolly sidekick mode: the chubby girl who's sure she'll die a virgin because adolescent guys, even in progressive Montgomery County, Maryland, are more likely to say ""no fatties"" or ""you're pretty for a big girl"" than to see how awesome she really is.
That's not to say that Albertalli made Molly into some romance-novel model of a plus-size perfection. Molly's not rocking any big-and-beautiful or fat-acceptance labels; she's just not constantly trying to diet or obsessed with her weight. And the story (a companion to Albertalli's Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda) is about much more than Molly's weight or even her romantic prospects. It's also about how sisterhood and best friendship can change when one or the other person is in love; how loyalties and priorities shift when romance blooms and your inner circle grows; and how sisters sometimes have to grow apart, ever so slightly, to grow up. But, there is romance. For those worried that this is another intolerable romance, never fear. There's only one real and true viable option for Molly, and he's wonderful. He and Molly talk with an ease that should be a lesson for all young readers. Love is about attraction, yes, but that attraction can start with friendship and a sense of being seen and known -- not simply desired, although there's that, too. And when it all comes together, it's magical.","Parents need to know that The Upside of Unrequited is award-winning, best-selling author Becky Albertalli's sophomore novel, a contemporary romance that's a companion to Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda. The story follows Molly Peskin-Suso nd to a lesser extent her twin sister, Cassie, best friends and cousins of Abby Suso, a supporting character in Simon. Molly has a ""lovely face"" but is fat, and while she doesn't have any interest in losing weight, she's worried she'll never find love. Like Albertalli's previous book, The Upside of Unrequited is extremely diverse, featuring LGBTQ characters and various racial, ethnic, and religious characters. Teens and adults curse (sometimes rather colorfully) in a believable way (some characters much more than others). The high schoolers (and occasionally the teens and their parents) also realistically discuss sexuality and identity, from experience (or lack thereof) to what qualifies as sex and losing virginity to birth control to  whether fat or nerdy teens are still desirable (spoiler alert: The answer is yes!). There's plenty to unpack and discuss if parents read this along with their teen, particularly about the individual experience of falling in love and why there's no timeline for when is the right time to discover first love.

"Glass Sword: Red Queen, Book 2",Lack of character development makes sequel a disappointment.,"GLASS SWORD picks up right after Red Queen ends, with Red-born Mare in an uneasy alliance with the Scarlet Guard, the underground rebellion that has taken Silver-blooded Prince Cal prisoner as they all escape the betrayal of Maven, now the king. Queen Elara used her mind-control skills to force heir apparent Cal to kill his own father, so her son, the second son Maven, could be crowned king. With Maven and Elara in power, they turn their sights to imprisoning or killing all the newbloods (Reds with Silver abilities) such as Mare. Obsessed with freeing others like her, Mare and a Scarlet Guard team that includes her brother Shade, her best friend Kilorn, and the reluctant Cal head out on a mission to gather the X-Men-like newbloods cross the kingdom to fight the bloodthirsty new king.
","First-person stories rely on the protagonist evolving, just as sequels must balance action and plot, and on both counts this installment fails to live up to its predecessor. Mare, now fully aware of her powers, is extremely unlikable in this installment. She's egotistical, angry, and cruel, calling her best friend ""nothing"" and constantly ruminating about her superiority as the ""lightning girl."" She immaturely swings from suspicious to hateful to disappointed in everyone and lives by the oft-repeated motto, ""Anyone can betray anyone."" While Mare's character development stalls with her constant self-aggrandizing mixed with bouts of insecurity and selfishness, the plot itself is quite thin for the 400-plus pages. It's basically a road-trip story of Mare, Scarlet Guard Captain Farley, and the rest of the crew going from place to place (they all have names, but there's no map to help readers figure out the layout of the kingdom) finding the newbloods with extraordinary abilities. The abilities read like one convenient way to get the band of misfits out of trouble, and except for a couple of standout characters, it's hard to keep track of all the newbloods. The romance continues to move at a glacial pace, and Cal emerges as one of the few characters to elicit empathy from readers. For a Big Bad villain, Mare's presence is barely felt, but at least the last 100 pages ramp up the action, proving the author's strength is closing a story with fireworks. Otherwise, readers will feel betrayed by this rushed and uninspired second book.","Parents need to know that Glass Sword is the sequel to Victoria Aveyard's best-selling dystopian fantasy Red Queen. As with most middle books in a series, it features an extraordinary protagonist and her allies on the run from an evil antagonist, considerable violence (some of the characters are like X-Men mutants with special abilities), and a dash of romance. Although there's a love story between a loyal best friend and a broody alpha male, it's tame compared with the more overt love stories in comparable titles, such as The Hunger Games, Divergent, The Selection, and The Grisha Trilogy. There's less political intrigue in this installment, and the plot isn't as action-packed until the last quarter. The main character's unlikable sense of superiority makes this sequel disappointing but necessary for those following the series.

The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,Popular series start shows positive girl friendships.,"Lena, Bridget, Tibby, and Carmen have been best friends since birth. Now, just before they're about to spend their first summer apart, they discover a pair of jeans that miraculously fits all of them, despite their differing physiques. And not just fit -- the Pants make each girl look and feel beautiful and confident. They don't know it yet, but they'll need that confidence during a summer that will test them, each in different ways.In a solemn midnight ceremony that will resonate with teen readers, the girls make up a compact about the Pants, part of which is that they'll send them back and forth among themselves throughout the summer.
","Ann Brashares is a great storyteller, building  reservoir of affection her characters that makes the climax of each of their stories effective. This book's main characters certainly experience their share of drama: Tibby befriends a 12-year-old with leukemia, Carmen's father has a new family, Lena falls in love in Greece, and Bridget has her first sexual experience, which devastates her. The friendship that the four girls share is the kind every teen longs for: rock solid and dependable, with no rivalries or pettiness to mar it, filled only with kindness, love, and understanding. If this friendship -- along with the girls' openness to the world and their capacity for honest self-appraisal and growth -- gives teen readers something to which to aspire, then this book will deserve its popularity.","Parents need to know that this book's emphasis on strong, supportive girl friendships may inspire readers -- and provides some nice counter-programming to clique lit's ""frenemies."" The characters do make some bad decisions, but they grow from them. There's some sexual content, language, and some pretty intense emotional stuff. Teens living out their own coming-of-age stories will likely get the most out of this book.

The Yggyssey,Sequel to The Neddiad offers more goofy humor.,"Iggy (short for Yggdrasil) Birnbaum lives in a run-down hotel in mid-20th century Hollywood. When she notices that the ghosts who normally inhabit her hotel are disappearing, she discovers that they are all heading for a big party in an alternate plane of existence. So she and her friends Neddy and Seamus follow the ghost of a rabbit and end up in an alternative Old New Hackensack where things are ... peculiar.
","Like its predecessor, The Neddiad, whether or not your kids will like this depends entirely on their particular senses of humor. Unlike humorous fantasies from, say, Douglas Adams or Terry Pratchett, the story won't carry readers through this if they don't get the jokes: there isn't much plot, and what there is doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Author Daniel Pinkwater isn't interested in any character development either -- Iggy and her friends are more or less just oddball blanks to whom odd things happen.
	So then, the humor, upon which enjoyment of this hangs. It's not broad, or potty, or slapstick, or humiliation humor -- it's gentle humor, of the polite sort, the jokes of a kind grandfather with a twinkle in his eye. Some of it is wordplay, some arch references, and a lot of the author amusing himself and if you want to go along, fine, he's not bothered either way. From the Book below has a sample, and if your kids find it funny, then they'll probably like this book. If not, you might want to look for something with a little more story and character -- just in case they don't get the jokes.
 From the Book:
	""We're going with you,"" Neddie Wentworthstein said.
	""To the hootenanny in not-in-New-Jersey Old New Hackensack?"" I asked.
	""Yes, the hootenanny, or hauntenanny, or walpurgisenanny, or whatever it is. If you're going, we want to go too,"" Seamus Finn said.

Boots on the Ground: America's War in Vietnam,"Powerful, intimate must-read account of the Vietnam War.","At the heart of BOOTS ON THE GROUND re Partridge's interviews with five American soldiers, an infantry medic, an Army nurse, and a Vietnamese refugee. Military Advisor Mike Horan was a foster kid who joined the Marines after high school and was captured by the North Vietnamese. Mexican American Gilbert de la O thought fighting for his country would mean people would ""treat me right"" when he came home. Machine Gunner Henry Allen had been trained in nonviolence by Martin Luther King, Jr. but found he ""lost compassion"" during his time in Vietnam. Medic Tom Kelly continually risked his life to rescue wounded soldiers in the field. Infantryman Jan Scruggs’ determination that those who died in Vietnam would always be remembered would lead to the creation of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Green Beret David Oshiro was called a ""gook"" more times than he could count. Chinese Italian Nurse Lily Lee Adams treated some of the most desperately wounded soldiers and civilians. Hoa Thi Nguyen was 18 when Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese and she was forced to flee with her mother and three younger siblings. Additional chapters focus on the policies of presidents John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Richard Nixon and the anti-war movement. Chapters on the creation of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial include an interview with the memorial’s designer, Maya Lin. A senior at Yale when she won the competition, her Asian American heritage made her a controversial choice. An Epilogue lets readers know what became of the men and women interviewed for the book.
","Unsparingly honest, haunting, and often heartbreaking interviews put a personal face on what it was like to be ""in country"" during the Vietnam War.  Because most of the men and women featured in Boots on the Ground are young -- just out of high school or college -- their stories are likely to bring this period of history alive to readers in ways no textbook could.","Parents need to know that Elizabeth Partridge’s Boots on the Ground: America's War in Vietnam is the war seen through the eyes of five young American soldiers, an infantry medic, an Army nurse, and a teenage Vietnamese refugee. Unfolding in chronological order from 1962 to the fall of Saigon in 1975, their stories are straightforward, deeply personal, and spare few details about what it was like to be caught in firefights and ambushes, see friends killed, and be wounded themselves. Chapters on presidents John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon provide a political context for the course of the war and give insights into many of their most important decisions and there are additional chapters focusing on the anti-war movement and the creation of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The nearly 100 photographs (archival news photographs and personal photos) put an often heartbreaking human face on the cost of war. A must-read for young readers wanting a deeper understanding of America's most controversial war.

Turning Pages: My Life Story,Inspiring life story of first Latina Supreme Court Justice.,"In TURNING PAGES: MY LIFE STORY, Sotomayor tells the story of growing up in a Spanish-speaking family in the Bronx, where she struggled to learn English. As a child, she was diagnosed with diabetes, and lost her father. Throughout, she enjoyed reading, and in Catholic high school, Bible stories helped her ""sort out right from wrong."" She attended Princeton University nd then studied law, where ""Law books were maps to guide us to justice."" Now a Justice on the Supreme Court, she works with ""the most important words in American law -- the founding document of our government, the Constitution of the United States.""
","Sonia Sotomayor has done a supreme job crafting her autobiography for kids, writing in a friendly, accessible style, and threading her life story with concrete examples of how books buoyed her. Turning Pages: My Life Story uses books as an organizing principle, spotlighting books at each stage. For instance, comics about Supergirl leant her courage when she was diagnosed with diabetes. The library comforted her when her dad died. Nancy Drew mysteries and Lord of the Flies inspired her to think about the work she might want to do. She also weaves in the Bible and law books, and uses colorful metaphors to liken books to loyal friends, a harbor, a launchpad, a time machine, and even her snorkel and flippers.
The theme of social justice is strong. Bible stories she read in Catholic school about empathy and forgiveness remained with her. Books she read in college included ones about Puerto Rico and ""men and women there who worked hard, but were paid very little,"" just like ""my grandfather worked in a cigar factory and got sick from the dust, and my aunt spent long days stitching handkerchiefs."" At law school, ""law books reflected real-life stories of people who got into trouble but still needed to be treated fairly in court."" Sotomayor's life is  true inspiration,  model for kids from diverse backgrounds nd all kids.","Parents need to know that Turning Pages: My Life Story is a picture book autobiography by Sonia Sotomayor, the first Latina Supreme Court Justice, illustrated by Latina artist Lulu Delacre.

Lucky for Good,Third book in offbeat series explores the meaning of family.,"Lucky's life in the impoverished desert community of Hard Pan is not an easy one, and when the health department threatens to close down her adopted mother's restaurant, the challenges only increase. She is grappling with other big issues, too, like how she feels about her missing father, how best to confront the prejudice against her immigrant stepmom, and what to do when her dinosaur-loving friend is reunited with his mother, a recovering addict who wants him to read only the Bible. With the support of some very quirky characters she tries to put life in perspective, for herself and those she loves.
","This third book in the series is sometimes uneven and a bit disjointed, but the story is packed with humor, heartwarming episodes, and well-drawn characters. Readers will find it easy to care about spunky Lucky, a girl with a heart as big as the desert sky and a mind full of ""what ifs."" The characters are eccentric -- Lincoln is a knot-tying expert, and Lucky herself investigates anything she encounters, from owl pellets to the ancient Viking alphabet -- but kids will appreciate the topics she and her friends talk about, and the way they care for one another. Lucky and her crazy community make it a lot of fun to think about important issues, such as the meaning of life -- and family. ","Parents need to know that this book is the third in a trilogy that began with the Newbery Award winner The Higher Power of Lucky.  Each book can be read separately, but the whole story would make more sense if read in order. Lucky is a thoughtful character and this book includes discussions of evolution, Darwin vs. the Bible, life after death, heaven and hell, and other issues that make kids worry. Characters struggle with prejudice, addiction, and more, but there is a sweet message about the true meaning of family -- and how it can be about something far wider than biological relationship.

The Odyssey,"Essential, epic poem of Greek gods, monsters, and heroes.","When THE ODYSSEY begins, the heroic warrior, Odysseus, has been missing for 10 years, and dozens of greedy suitors are camped out in his house in Ithaca, courting his wife, Penelope, eating his meat and drinking his wine. Odysseus' son, Telemakhos wants to take his place as head of the household, but he is too young and inexperienced to rule over the suitors and he doesn't know if his father is coming home. With the help of the goddess Athena (who disguises herself as a family friend), Telemakhos embarks on a journey of discovery where he meets people who have known his father, and learns a great deal about Odysseus and about himself. Meanwhile, Odysseus is still trying to sail home from the wars; he must overcome numerous supernatural obstacles before he can reclaim his home and family.
","The Odyssey isn't just an important book, it's also a very exciting book and a beautiful work of literature. As the popular Percy Jackson series for younger readers attests, kids are fascinated by Greek tales of gods, monsters, and heroes, and The Odyssey is the original Olympian tale. The epic hero, Odysseus, overcomes supernatural creatures and all kinds of magic, thanks to gods warring among themselves. The prose of The Odyssey, while possibly daunting for middle school and younger kids, is worth appreciating with its beautiful, rhythmically repeated images: ""grey-eyed Athena,"" dawn spreading her ""fingertips of rose,"" etc.","Parents need to know that, as the name implies, The Odyssey is an epic poem of journey and discovery. It's an essential book for students of literature and students of Greek history and culture. Because the book recounts not only Odysseus' tumultuous journey home and his son Telemakhos' coming of age but also tales of Odysseus' bravery in the Trojan War, it includes a good deal of violence. There's also some implied sexual activity (though nothing graphic).

When the jeep stalls, the sheep get out to push the jeep over a small hill. However, the sheep don't notice that the road on the downhill side leads to a pit of mud. The sheep try to pull their jeep out of the mud using a rope, but they're not strong enough. They enlist the help of two big pigs who rescue the jeep, and the sheep rejoice. The sheep resume their drive, but this time, the driver doesn't notice that they're heading toward a large tree. The jeep crashes and is ruined (though all the sheep are fine). In the end, the sheep put a sign on the tree that says, ""Jeep for sale.""

I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter,"Empowering, stereotype-shattering coming-of-age story.","In I AM NOT YOUR PERFECT MEXICAN DAUGHTER, Julia Reyes lives with her parents and older sister, Olga, in a Chicago neighborhood filled with graffiti, gangs, and cockroaches. Her parents, who are both undocumented, work long, hard hours to provide as best they can for the family. For Julia's mother, Olga is the perfect Mexican daughter. She still lives at home, dresses modestly, has a respectable job, and doesn't date. In stark contrast, Julia is rebellious and often lashes out at her overprotective parents, who she feels are not supportive of her dreams of going to college in New York City. She's almost estranged from her mother, who wants to constantly know where Julia's going and what she'll be doing. After Olga is hit and killed by a truck, Julia discovers sexy underwear and the key to a Chicago hotel room among her sister's belongings. Olga, it seems, had a secret life. As Julia begins to uncover Olga's secrets, her own life takes some equally dramatic turns. She meets her first boyfriend, who's wealthy and white, her parents send her to stay with family in Mexico, hoping her behavior will change, and she battles anxiety and depression. ","Determined and sometimes enraging Latina teen comes of age in a story filled with shocking discoveries, family conflicts, long-buried secrets, rebellion, and reconciliation. Readers may have varied reactions to the character of Julia. For many, she'll be a role model for overcoming the odds and going after your dreams. For others, her often judgmental and dismissive attitude (even toward things like the quinceañera that means so much to her mother) may well be a turnoff.
While the main storyline is extremely strong and compelling, the novel has enough subplots (Julia's wealthy white boyfriend, being forced to leave school for a time and live with family in Mexico, a gay friend, mental health issues) that some readers may have a hard time keeping track of where the story is going.","Parents need to know that Erika L.

Where the Wild Things Are,Classic all-ages masterpiece has a wild imagination.,"Wild child Max gets sent to bed without his supper after threatening to eat his mom. Well, he'll show her, right? In his room -- or, at least, in his mind -- a forest grows. Max boards a ship that takes him across oceans and days to the home of the wild things, which threaten him with snarls and claws and eye-rolling. Does this frighten our little wolf-boy? Of course not! Max hypnotizes the monsters, who declare him the most wild thing of all. Max joins in on the fun but quickly bores of the new adventure and sails back home -- to find supper in his room, still hot!
","This wonderful book is arguably Sendak's best work -- and one of the true classics of children's literature. Perhaps the most appealing element is the wordless series of illustrations in which, after Max begins the ""wild rumpus,"" he and his new friends dance and cavort through six pages of some of the most whimsical, enchanting, and unique artwork in children's literature. The message of unconditional parental love is reassuring to young ones and a perfect ending to the story.
There's a reason why this won the Caldecott Medal. Sendak's giant monster characters are iconic. While they are described as scary in the book, their faces and lumbering frames make them appear almost jovial. You can almost feel the room shake when you watch them cavort in the forest.

The Tears of the Salamander,"A dark, brilliant, and breathtaking surprise.","Alfredo divides his time between his father's bakery, where he has a talent for controlling the oven fires, and the Cathedral, where his talent for singing brings him tremendous joy. But when a fire kills his family, his uncle Giorgio takes him away from everything he loves to live in the family's ancient home on the volcanic Mt. Etna in Sicily.
	There he finds that his family has, for generations, had the task of controlling the fires of the mountain, and his uncle plans for him to inherit the job. But his uncle's plans may be deeper, and more sinister, than he is letting on, and involve danger not only for Alfredo, but also for the mute servant and her brain-damaged son who live with them.
","The story isn't the story here; it's a perfectly serviceable story, of course, and in the hands of a lesser writer that's all it would be. But this soaringly lyrical combination of music, fire, and magic rises off the page like an aria.
Alfredo is a most appealing hero. Though a choirboy, he possesses both the talents and the anger of his forebears, who master the most elemental of forces.

It Was September When We Ran Away the First Time,Engaging look at 1950s kids; some history lessons required.,"The third in a series about 12-year-old Paolo (the previous novel boasts an even longer name: Probably the World's Best Story About a Dog and the Girl Who Loved Me), IT WAS SEPTEMBER WHEN WE RAN AWAY THE FIRST TIME works as a stand-alone title as well.

This would make a lovely read-aloud so parents can provide some historical context while laughing at Paolo's precocious first-person narrative. ""It has always been our family's way to go along with the Bible or leastways on the interesting bits,"" he notes. This is novel where the characters shine; Smith adeptly fleshes out adult characters, even within the confines of Paolo's perspective. ""My dad is chock-full of virtue,"" Paolo explains. ""He's especially Determined; though sometimes I think Determined is a first cousin to Stubborn."" The boys engage in all sorts of antics, from Paolo blowing on Billy's eyeballs to wake him up to Paolo tying Georgie up and nearly suffocating him with a mouth gag. Like readers of any nostalgic novel (fBeverly Cleary's series, for example), contemporary kids may wonder at the freedom young people used to enjoy roaming around town.
	The question is whether younger readers will appreciate Paolo's insights, catch references to John Wayne, or understand all the to-do about Communism and interracial relationships.","Parents need to know that this book addresses racism in a small town in the 1950s. There is little historical context so young readers may be confused by why interracial relationships and Communism are such a big deal. Characters call a Chinese girl a ""china doll."" There are some references to drinking and smoking by adults. One of the main characters is deaf.

Mick Harte Was Here,Difficult life-death questions are meant for discussion.,"Phoebe tells the story of her brother Mick's death in a bicycle accident, and its aftermath. Tracing the unpredictable, lonely path a bereaved family travels toward recovery, Barbara Park paints a very individual but ultimately universal portrait of memory and grief with acute insight. Through funny and poignant memories, eighth-grader Phoebe Harte introduces her brother Mick, 10 months younger, and tells the story of his fatal accident. She then describes her reactions and experiences over the ensuing days. She attends his funeral, interment, and memorial service, and gradually is comforted by her best friend, her spiritual intuition, and her family. As she struggles with her feelings, she makes a re-entry into daily life and school, finding setbacks, support, and, finally, stability.
","This book is a demonstration of the devastating power of simplicity. With breathtaking economy and precise strokes, Barbara Park brings Mick Harte and his sister Phoebe to vivid life. And because Park gives Phoebe such a distinct, genuine voice, her reactions are real and familiar. Park moves the reader back and forth, from Mick to his sister, gradually disengaging them, separating the tightly interwoven strands of their lives, until Phoebe can stand alone. The author makes hardly a misstep; all the book's elements are tied together with enormous skill. Even the lesson about wearing bicycle helmets is made so directly and simply that it doesn't seem at all preachy. In fact, when the father wishes he had made Mick wear his, it's one of the book's most moving moments.
Not all young readers will want or be able to handle the questions Park asks. But those who do will find that, with MICK HARTE WAS HERE, ""here"" is a lasting place in their hearts.","Parents need to know that Mick Harte Was Here deals with the death of a sibling. It is written with simplicity and sensitivity, as young Phoebe tells the story of losing her younger brother, Mick, in a bicycle accident, her feelings during the aftermath of his death, and her re-entry into daily life.

The Bippolo Seed and Other Lost Stories,Treasure of lost Seuss tales a great all-ages read-aloud.,"Seuss scholar Charles D. Cohen has researched and collected seven stories by Dr. Seuss that were published in magazines during the 1950s, before his other books became household classics. They include a story of a duck led to greed by a conniving cat, a rabbit who tricks a bear out of eating him, a goldfish who outgrows his bowl, a set of twins trying to find their individuality, crazy creatures in search of a steak dinner, a kid trying to clean the spot out of his shirt, and another kid with a great imagination. The stories are told in rhyming couplets, with a rhythm that is recognizably a Dr. Seuss trademark. And the illustrations are as zany and silly as you might expect. Cohen has added a wonderfully informative introduction that explains his search as well as the importance of each story, and how it fit into the development of the Dr. Seuss whom readers have grown to love.
","This book is not just for kids; adult readers, especially those who remember some of the stories from various magazines they may have read as kids, will enjoy the collection too. As readers may expect, the rhymes and rhythms carry the tales from one crazy moment to the next as zany characters work out whatever silly situation they find themselves in. New words are created, bizarre beasts strut about the pages, and imagination carries the day. Dr. Seuss books are always fun to read aloud, and the stories in this collection are no different.  Readers of all ages will find themselves picking it up more than once, and giving it voice even if no one else is in the room.  Finding these lost stories is, as Cohen says, like ""finding a silver box containing a Bippolo Seed.""","Parents need to know that this compilation of seven stories written by Dr. Seuss, a.k.a. Ted Geisel, between 1948 and 1959 is not a collection of rehashed tales already in print. Lost, and perhaps forgotten, they are stories once published in magazines and more recently collected by Charles D. Cohen, recognized as ""the world's foremost Seuss scholar."" Readers will recognize seeds of later stories as well as the playful rhyming language and quirky characters we have all come to expect from a Dr. Seuss book. The colors of the illustrations have been enriched, which makes it all the more appealing to the eye.

Make Way for Ducklings,Kids and parents enjoy this story about family.,"Honk, honk! \""Quack!\"" Watch out for the cars, Mrs. Mallard! She must convey her eight ducklings safely across several busy Boston streets to the Public Garden so they can meet their father. Children and parents will enjoy sharing this endearing story about family. The illustrations are all in sepia charcoal, which will disappoint some kids used to full color.
 ","Family is the central theme in this engaging Robert McCloskey classic. The mallard ducks illustrate love and care in the family. McCloskey describes the adult ducks carefully selecting a nesting site and, later, teaching the ducklings basic survival skills. Tension and adventure are created in the story during their dangerous trip across busy streets to get to the Public Garden and safety.
Today's children respond with enthusiasm and affection for the ducks and ducklings, barely noticing the dated cars or police officer's uniform. Sepia-toned charcoal art on cream-colored paper conveys the story's gentle love and warmth. Today's children, however, may find the one-tone illustrations dull. Children will appreciate being able to count all eight ducklings in each illustration of the family and will check to see that all are present.","Parents need to know that there is nothing of concern in this gentle story of a family of ducks, told skillfully and straightforwardly. The ducklings are raised by the mother and father ducks in such a way that considers their overall surroundingss and utilizes resources that their community provides.

"Ronia, the Robber's Daughter","Enchanting fantasy boasts spirited heroine, loving family.","The stormy night RONIA, THE ROBBER'S DAUGHTER is born, lightning cleaves her family's fort in two. She's raised within the confines of the stronghold by her patient mother, Lovis, and her adoring father, the robber chief Matt. One day Ronia encounters a boy named Birk, son of the rival chief Borka, and saves him from a terrible fall. Borka's wife and his band of robbers have moved into the other side of the fort, infuriating Matt. Ronia and Birk become devoted friends, meeting in secret in the magical woods. But when their feuding parents discover their relationship, Ronia is disowned by her father and the children run away to live in the forest. Ronia is heartbroken to have to choose between her birth family and the boy she calls brother.
","This magical adventure story by Swedish author Astrid Lindgren features a fiercely independent heroine to rival her beloved Pippi Longstocking in determination, loyalty, and sheer chutzpah. Ronia, the Robber's Daughter weaves a spell from some classic building blocks of great stories: an enchanted forest of great beauty and great danger, feuding clans, forbidden friendship, and rebellious children. Lindgren skillfully straddles the line: Her characters break rules and take great risks, but the overriding message is about responsibility to yourself and to others.
The pace of the story -- and this edition's small type -- might turn off some modern readers. Fortunately, it's a wonderful read-aloud: An adult can help bring to life the lively banter between Ronia and her loved ones. Lindgren's description of the forest's changing nature through the seasons is worth lingering over.","Parents need to know that Ronia, the Robber's Daughter, first published in 1981, is a fantasy by Astrid Lindgren (Pippi Longstocking) featuring a free-thinking, self-reliant girl being raised in a band of thieves. The warmhearted men in the clan are loyal and very fond of Ronia. They drink and get rowdy, and the chief in particular is prone to yelling and throwing objects when he's angry or upset. Ronia and her friend Birk do not approve of thieving but love their families unconditionally. There are some scenes of intense, fantastical dangers, including attacks by clawing harpies and menacing dwarves and gnomes. The rivalry between robber clans -- and disagreements within each family -- is full of angry threats and promises of violence. Two men face off in a violent fight for supremacy, ending with mutual respect and friendship. Characters deal with starvation, freezing, and the risk of execution. One character dies peacefully. The book makes a great read-aloud. It was also dapted by Studio Ghibli (Spirited Away) for an animated series with a slightly different title, Ronja, the Robber's Daughter, which premiered in early 2017.

In exchange for being a contestant on the show, Jane gets a room nd the chance to remake herself. Along the way, she learns some poignant lessons about friendship, faith, and the meaning of life. ","Despite the rather devastating premise, this is a complex story about how to get back on your feet after falling hard.

Scaredy Squirrel,Frightened-squirrel tale great for helping kids face fears.,"Scaredy Squirrel is afraid of a lot of things: bees, germs, martians, the unknown. He's so afraid that he has his daily routine down to an exact, repetitive science where he never leaves his tree so he never has to deal with anything amiss. (And if he does, there's a plan for that!) But what if something did happen? Would Scaredy be prepared? What would he do if one of his worst fears came true? Would it really be the worst?
","SCAREDY SQUIRREL is a magnificent book written and illustrated by Melanie Watt.

Return to Sender,Intense story about illegal immigration and friendship.,"Eleven-year old Tyler worries about losing his Vermont farm after the sudden death of his grandfather and a tractor accident leaves his father unable to work. Tyler is desperate to save his farm from being sold. But after his father hires a family of illegal Mexican workers, Tyler wonders if saving the farm is worth breaking the law. Soon Tyler meets Mari, the eldest daughter in the Mexican family. While initially wary of each other, Tyler and Mari soon form a unique friendship that opens their eyes to the lives of the other. Both kids worry about their families and their future, and come to realize that they are forever connected through their shared struggles.
","RETURN TO SENDER is a compassionate narrative that puts a human heart to the hot-button topic of illegal immigration. The story portrays the desire for a better life and how hard work is the means to achieve it. The author captures the intense emotions of both farmer and worker, and tells the story through the questioning innocence of children. However, the main characters -- both 11 years old -- are strapped with enormous emotional burdens and life's adult responsibilities, and the story is laden with their fear and worry.
Parents and educators will find this an important and significant read, but the question remains if kids will actually enjoy reading it.","Parents need to know that Return to Sender explores illegal immigration in a sympathetic way (immigration laws are not fully described and enforcers are presented negatively), as readers come to know the hearts and minds of both the Vermont family and the Mexican family in the story.

Can Miri find a way to help Molly without altering history for the worse?
","THE MAGIC HALF is a rewarding read with clever turns, well-developed characters, and neatly drawn-out suspense.

Sinner,Captivating L.A. romance about a werewolf and a fashionista.,"SINNER takes place six months after the events of the Wolves of Mercy Falls series conclusion, Forever. Beautiful ice queen Isabel Culpepper has moved from Minnesota to Los Angeles, where she works in a trendy boutique and lives with her separated mother, divorced aunt, and shy younger cousin Sophia. Sometime werewolf and former rock star Cole St. Clair also has fled Minnesota for Los Angeles -- to appear on a reality Web show, record an album, and woo Isabel. A recovering addict, Cole is faced with temptation while trying to start a new, happier life with Isabel, who's wary of loving someone with such a sordid past, especially as she deals with the demise of her own parents' marriage.
","Readers familiar with Stiefvater's style will revel in her luscious prose, her lyrical sense of place, and her swoon-worthy descriptions of falling in love and sharing a mind-blowing kiss. Stiefvater has said that Sinner is the ""truest novel"" she's ever written, and that's because, except for the little fact that Cole is secretly a werewolf, Sinner reads more like a nuanced contemporary romance than a fantasy love story like her other books. Renowned for her passion for cars (which are lovingly described in each of her books) and driving metaphors, Stiefvater quite perfectly sets Sinner in Los Angeles, where everyone spends a good portion of his or her life behind the wheel. Cole's desire for his beloved old Mustang, Isabel's anger at her blinged-out SUV, and Cole's new good friend Leon, a limo driver, are only a few examples of the significant connection between characters and cars in the revved-up love story.
Fans of Sam and Grace should take heart: They are both mentioned in this novel, although their cameos aren't nearly as substantial as Etienne and Anna's in Stephanie Perkins' Lola and the Boy Next Door. Stiefvater clearly wants the spotlight to stay on Cole and Isabel's turbulent romance, not dwell on another couple's happily-ever-after. Cole and Isabel are far edgier than earnest Sam and Grace, so it's fitting that this story is an unputdownable ride you'll be sad to finish.","Parents need to know that Sinner is a stand-alone companion book to Maggie Stiefvater's Shiver trilogy, but, instead of focusing on that series' central couple, Sam and Grace, it follows former rock star (and werewolf) Cole and emotionally fragile beauty Isabel. A story of love and friendship in Los Angeles, Sinner contains mature references to recovering addict Cole's sex-drugs-and-rock-'n'-roll past, as well as his ongoing impulses to score. There are underage characters who drink and young adults (their age is unclear) who smoke pot, take ecstasy, and drink to excess. Some of the characters occasionally use strong language, and the entire story is permeated by the red-hot chemistry between the main characters. One scene features some topless groupies, and a single woman nearly has sex with a married man, but there's only one actual love scene in the book, and it's tastefully described with an emphasis on the couple's emotions, not the act itself. Readers who are fans of Stiefvater's books will love her return to the Mercy Falls universe's most compelling secondary characters.

"Infinity Ring: A Mutiny in Time, Book 1",Gripping multimedia time-travel adventure series debut.,"History-loving Dak and science genius Sera are living in a world plagued by earthquakes and food shortages -- and a hyper-controlling government known as the SQ. When Sera is able to complete the time machine that Dak's scientist parents have been working on -- an invention called the Infinity Ring -- the fifth-grade best friends find themselves being called to a surprising new mission. A group called the Hystorians asks them to travel back in time to moments where history is broken to see whether they can right past wrongs and keep the SQ out of power. Their first stop: preventing mutinous brothers from taking over Christopher Columbus' ship.
","Kids will certainly be caught up in this adventure as two likable characters use their big brains to time-travel and stop a mutiny -- and hopefully save the world they're living in.
Author James Dashner covers a lot of ground here, explaining the Infinity Ring, the SQ, and getting Dak and Sera on their way to save Columbus. Some readers may get a bit lost trying to track exactly what's happening with time and what the breaks are all about; it's pretty sophisticated stuff. (One way the Hystorians know that time is broken is that some characters like Sera experience ""Remnants,"" ghost-like memories that feel very real and leave them upset.) Even so, the author throws in enough humor, adventure, and inventive details -- like devices that let you speak and understand any language! -- to keep even reluctant readers engaged.","Parents need to know that Infinity Ring: A Mutiny in Time is the kick-off of a seven-book time-travel adventure series that has an accompanying interactive video game. Readers will learn something about Aristotle, Columbus, Rasputin, the American Revolution, and more -- as well as get some insight into the importance of thinking for yourself and fighting back against an overly controlling government. Protagonists Dak and Sera are very brave and loyal to each other, and they use their talents -- she's a science whiz and he's a history buff -- to help save the world. There's some violence and danger here as the two fifth-graders survive an explosion, get locked in prison and sentenced to death, and are in a melee involving swords, fists, and gunplay. Dak also almost drowns when he's thrown overboard.

Guts,"Funny, sensitive account of dealing with bathroom anxiety.","As GUTS begins, Raina catches the stomach flu and vomits. She doesn't think much of the incident until she starts feeling sick at school for no particular reason. Soon, she can't stop thinking about needing to use the bathroom and fearing that she'll be sick. It gets to the point where she is having trouble concentrating on her schoolwork. She starts to see a therapist and learns techniques for calming herself down, which also help her at school and among her friends. ","Everyone uses the bathroom, and this funny, moving graphic novel demonstrates what happens when a person gives too much thought to the process. With a sharp eye for design and a discerning ear for dialogue, Raina Telgemeier chronicles in Guts her struggles with anxiety and digestion issues during elementary and middle school. As an illustrator, she captures the big gestures that kids make during those years, giving the characters an expressiveness that ably transmits their internal feelings.

Vampirina Ballerina,"Cute, comic how-to for aspiring vampire ballerinas.","Fang-in-cheek narration offers dos and don'ts for any vampires who might want to become ballet dancers, as it follows the actions of cute little VAMPIRINA BALLERINA. She must attend night classes, because vampires sleep in the daytime; avoid smiling, because her fangs might scare the other dancers; and resist turning into a bat (for the same reason). She works toward her big debut performance, makes freinds with her classmates, and is cheered by her loving, supportive, ghoulish family.
 ","Vampirina Ballerina works on two levels -- as a cute story about learning ballet and as a fish-out-of water tale, in which an unusual girl learns how to fit into a mainstream setting. Many of the gags depend on knowing some vampire basics -- why Vampirina's reflection doesn't show in the dance studio mirror, why she has to take night classes, what's in the family's red bowls at dinnertime, why her mother is lying on a lounge chair working on her moon tan. LeUen Pham's funny, expressive, cartoon-like illustrations make Vampirina irresistible. ","Parents need to know that Vampirina Ballerina shows a little vampire girl taking up ballet, with a narrator explaining all the things a vampire should or shouldn't do in class, such as don't show your fangs, resist turning into a bat, and ""always get a good day's sleep."" Vampirina is an adorable character who works hard toward her goal, does well in her debut performance, and is supported and cheered by her loving family of ghouls and monsters. It's a fun twist on the scary vampire theme, making it perfect reading for little ones. But it helps if kids know some basics about vampire lore.

In the morning, Wilbur's entire family sends his friend on his way with a family rendition of ""Yes, We Have No Bananas,"" after which Wilbur apologizes for having shared such a dull time with his friend.
","Readers of any age will want to spend much more than a single day visiting the pages of A DAY WITH WILBUR ROBINSON.

"Susan B. Anthony: The Making of America, Book 4",Inspiring bio of a courageous champion of women's rights.,"SUSAN B. ANTHONY packed an almost unimaginable amount of social activism into her 86 years. She was an abolitionist, a campaigner for women's rights, a labor activist, an educational reformer, and a crusading newspaper owner. Born in 1820, she was raised in a well-to-do (most of the time) Quaker family by a father who believed strongly that his daughters should be educated women. Anthony became a teacher and eventually headmistress of a school, both remarkable achievements for a young woman. But when her father introduced her to abolitionists Fredrick Douglass and William Lloyd Garrison, Anthony set out on a new path as an activist and never looked back. She began organizing anti-slavery meetings and lectures at a time when a woman speaking in public (not to mention in support of such a controversial cause) was considered almost scandalous. In 1851, she met Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who was already a leader in the women's suffrage movement. For the next 50 years, they would lead the fight for women's rights. Anthony lobbied Congress each year for the rest of her life, advocating for women's right to vote. She lived to see women get the vote in Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, and Idaho but died at age 86, 14 years before the 19th Amendment was ratified in 1920, finally giving women the right to vote in every state.
","This is an inspiring, in-depth biography of a feminist crusader who worked tirelessly for a future where a woman could be ""her own individual self,"" fully equal with men. Because Susan B. Anthony led multiple lives as an activist, the book is information heavy. The photos, illustrations, and sidebars provide good breaks in the text, as readers can see photos of the people Anthony was working alongside, copies of posters for her meetings, and explanations of things like paternalism and a woman's role in 19th-century America. But readers who aren't history fans or who are looking for a quick read may be easily overwhelmed by the sheer amount of people, dates, and events.","Parents need to know that Teri Kanefield's Susan B. Anthony: The Making of America is a lively, information-packed look at the remarkable life of America's most famous suffragist. Using Anthony's own writings and dozens of archival photos and illustrations, Kanefield traces Anthony's life from her Quaker childhood in Massachusetts to her years as an activist and organizer in the temperance and anti-slavery movements, and finally to her work as one the world's leading advocates for a woman's right to vote. Anthony's story is a strong reminder for readers that there was a time in the not-so-long-ago past when the only citizens with rights were white and male, and women were viewed as ""property."" Husbands could legally beat their wives, take any money they brought into a marriage or earned, and even have them committed to an asylum. For readers who only know Anthony as suffragist, the biography will introduce them to a woman who was also a teacher, a newspaper publisher, a labor organizer, and an educational reformer. This is the fourth installment in Kanefield's Making of America series that includes biographies of Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Jackson, and Alexander Hamilton.

Beloved,Haunting Pulitzer Prize winner about slavery's impact.,"Sethe is an ex-slave who chooses to kill her children rather than allow her family to be captured back into slavery. She succeeds in killing only her second youngest, who later returns to haunt the house in which the family lives -- first in ethereal form and then as a woman calling herself Beloved.

While there aren't whole armies facing off, like in the 2017 Wonder Woman movie, there are still plenty of skirmishes with explosions, gunfire, swords, a plane and some cars ripped apart, and a boat exploding with most passengers drowning. The most common way people die is by being riddled with bullets from automatic weapons. The grossest death: an exsanguination (someone being completely drained of their blood) by a huge mythical creature. There's a little strong language at times of stress, ""s--t"" and ""bitch"" being the worst of it. Plus, there's some kissing and nonsexual swimming-hole nudity.

She admires them greatly, but falls in love with Matthew, a British soldier who kills an American in the Boston Massacre. Rachel can't decide where her loyalties lie. Many kids will enjoy reading this, and they'll learn some history along the way.
 ","Ann Rinaldi has been tempting teenagers to read romances and learn some real history for over a decade; this doesn't stand out as her best effort, but it's a useful book. Rinaldi often writes in sentence fragments. The deliberately choppy writing style slows the pace of the book, but Rachel's inner struggle for independence still holds many readers' attention.
Rinaldi devotes most of the book to Rachel's evolving thinking. Except for a few riots, the incidents culminating in the Boston Massacre don't occur until more than halfway into the story. Rachel, Boston, the Revolution, romance, and the concept of independence dominate the story. Rachel's movement toward her own liberty mirrors the evolution of the ""plain Americans.""","Parents need to know that this is a romance with the Boston Massacre as a backdrop.

The Taking,Smart sci-fi thriller explores girl's odd 5-year absence.,"Following an argument with her father, 16-year-old Kyra Agnew wakes up behind the Gas 'n' Sip, unsure how she got there and even more surprised to learn she's been missing for five years. Her parents have split up, her mom has a new husband and toddler son, and Austin, her high school boyfriend, has gone off to college with her best friend. Kyra herself has not aged a bit, and she displays some disturbing new abilities, including rapid healing powers, leading to interest from some sinister government agents. The only person Kyra can trust is Tyler, Austin's younger brother, now 17 years old and still attracted to her. As they retrace her steps and try to figure out the mystery behind her disappearance, Kyra and Tyler grow closer, but they must eventually face the otherworldly power that turned her life upside down.
","THE TAKING is a smart, involving science-fiction thriller with an intriguing premise and a cast of interesting and sympathetic characters. Author Kimberly Derting keeps the suspense cranked high without descending into pointless chase scenes. Rather, she concentrates on Kyra's emotional turmoil as she tries to figure out why and how her entire life has been upended. The sci-fi conspiracy plot begs the question of why there's no media attention focused on a teenager who reappears after a mysterious half-decade's absence, but most readers probably won't be bothered by that plot hole. Also problematic is the way in which Kyra and Tyler constantly remark on how wonderful and special the other is. The romantic subplot is bouncy and usually fun, but the mutual admiration is laid on a little thick.","Parents need to know that The Taking is a smart and well-told science-fiction thriller about a high school student who loses five years of her life seemingly overnight. The premise is intriguing and carefully explored, and Kyra and her new boyfriend, Tyler, are depicted with wit and insight. There's more strong language than one might expect -- ""hell,"" ""pissed,"" and ""damn"" are employed frequently; ""s--t,"" and ""f--k"" are used a time or two, usually in scenes of great tension. Violence in the book is more often implied that shown (including a suicide), although there is some gunplay. In terms of sexual content, 16-year-old Kyra spends a lot of time fixated on the attractiveness of her boyfriends, especial Tyler. She shares a bed with Tyler, but no sexual intimacy is implied.

Pink Me Up,Dad's a really good sport in this fun father-daughter tale.,"When Mama breaks out in spots and can’t go to a pink party, Violet wails that it’s the worst day ever. Her daddy offers to take her, but Violet sees a big problem: Boys are not pink! Her father is a good sport, however, and lets Violet outfit him appropriately for a celebration of all things pink -- inspiring the other girls to get to work on their own dads at home.
","Kids don’t need to love the color pink to enjoy this sweet story -- but it sure helps. Violet is immediately empathetic, both in her excitement for the Pink Girls Pink-nik and her devastation when it looks like her plans are ruined. Her father's patience with her disappointment, and his willingness to set dignity aside and turn the misadventure into a creative celebration, is a terrific example for families. Rather than make the hard case that boys can like pink just as much as girls, Charice Mericle Harper finds a way for the pink and the not-so-pink to happily share some common ground.
Wide-eyed, buck-toothed rabbits bound through cartoon pages decorated with just the right amount of pink.","Parents need to know this book may well inspire their little girls to start plastering Daddy’s tie with pink stickers!

Moving into the dorms, finding your way to class on time, and learning how to get along with a roommate are more than enough for anyone's plate. But add  dash of Iron Man, a heaping helping of Whiplash, and a planet-sized Galactus to Doreen Green's helping. As Squirrel Girl, she'll need the help of friends, furry and otherwise, and all the courage and smarts she can muster to save the world this time.
","After a long period of doom and darkness in the comic-book world, Marvel's new supergirl bursts on the scene and knocks the hinges off the door by bringing the fun (and funny) back. The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl is a breath of fresh air in superhero-dom, not only because she's loaded with girl-powered positivity but because she fully embraces the silliness of all things squirrel.
Tweens and up will enjoy the corny yet witty jokes as North's writing easily balances them with exciting action and a suspenseful story arch. Henderson's vivid, dynamic illustrations ably enhance the flow, keeping eyes moving and pages turning. A bonus at the very end reprints the very first appearance of Squirrel Girl as she tries to impress Iron Man and join the Avengers.","Parents need to know that The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl, Volume 1, is a collection of the first four issues featuring an ongoing Marvel superhero. Originally created in the '90s, Squirrel Girl received a reboot in 2015. She's a great role model for girls, brimming with self confidence, unafraid of physical confrontation but proving most effective when she makes personal connections and thinks creatively. Occasional cartoonish violence shows one tooth knocked out with red at the root.

The New Adventures of Curious George,"Anthology compiles funny, later George stories.","THE NEW ADVENTURES OF CURIOUS GEORGE compiles eight later George stories about the ""good little monkey"" who's ""also very curious."" In each story, George visits a different place with his friend the man with the yellow hat. George's curiosity gets him into mischief when he lets a litter of puppies and their mother dog out of a cage, for example, or accidentally flies off in a hot air balloon. However, his antics end up somehow resolving a problem: Mother dog finds a missing puppy; George comes to the aid of a worker stranded on Mount Rushmore! In George stories, all's always well that ends well.
","Not all Curious George stories are created equal, and the six installments included in this anthology are more formulaic than the original George books. However, young children often enjoy predictability, so that's not necessarily a problem for the books' intended audience.
All of these stories contain the warm, cute pictures that kids love, and the funny antics that George is known for. This is an entertaining collection that will bring lots of enjoyment at a price that's lower than purchasing all of these books separately.","Parents need to know that The New Adventures of Curious George is a compendium of later stories written after the passing of Curious George authors H. A. Rey and Margret Rey. Each is illustrated in the style of the Reys, and George looks just as adorable and funny in these stories as he did in the original books. The stories are ""Curious George Goes to a Chocolate Factory,"" ""Curious George and the Puppies,"" ""Curious George Makes Pancakes,"" ""Curious George Feeds the Animals,"" ""Curious George Goes to a Movie,"" ""Curious George and the Hot Air Balloon,"" ""Curious George in the Snow,"" and ""Curious George's Dream.""

"My Family Divided: One Girl's Journey of Home, Loss, and Hope","Heartbreaking, inspiring memoir of popular actress.","MY FAMILY DIVIDED begins with Diane Guerrero as  typical tween girl, spending lots of time with her three best friends, going to school, watching her favorite shows, and hanging out with her family. But underneath there's a constant worry about her parents' documentation status, something that's been a part of her life for as long as she can remember. At 14, her parents and brother are in fact taken away from her and deported back to Colombia. Diane, who was born in the U.S., stays alone in the country with the help of family friends. She must balance becoming n independent adult (far earlier than most) with pursuing an ambitious acting career and trying to succeed in school. This story shows her journey to become the successful actress she is today, despite ll the obstacles she had to overcome. ","This well-written memoir tells an incredible story of persistence, courage, and triumph. In her personable and friendly voice, actress/author Diane Guerrero recounts her personal experiences of what many people in the U.S. have to face every single day. While the topics tackled in My Family Divided re difficult and complex, Guerrero uses simple language and an approachable tone to help readers understand her struggle. Her journey is truly inspirational, and every part of the book is educational and enlightening, though much of it can also be heartbreaking. She doesn't sugarcoat any of it but reflects on her experiences thoughtfully and explains her actions at different points in the book. 
My Family Divided is a natural fit for kids interested in politics, immigration, the news, and current events. It's a moving and inspiring story for readers mature enough to handle it. ","Parents need to know that My Family Divided is the gritty and incredibly inspiring memoir of Orange Is the New Black actress Diane Guerrero, who overcame numerous obstacles to get to where she is today. Adapted for children from her original autobiography for adults and written with Erica Moroz, it details Guerrero's experience navigating the aftermath of her parents' nd brother's deportation when she was 14, tackling severe mental health issues, nd the difficulties of breaking into the entertainment industry. There's a reference to Guerrero having had a drinking habit that she sought help for,  few instances of mild swearing (""damn,"" ""hell""), and a physical fight not described in detail, and mention that Diane's aunt was fatally shot and Diane's mother continued to grieve for her later in life. Guerrero struggles with depression, resorts to self-harm (cutting), and has thoughts of suicide but gets help. Although marketed to a middle grade audience, this memoir could be disturbing for younger readers. The thought of parents being taken away can be traumatic, and the book tackles complex issues in a very personal way. The book is a better fit for teens, especially those who are curious about immigration and mature enough to talk about complex issues. It's hard to see Diane struggling, but overall it's an inspiring and enlightening read. Black-and-white photos are included throughout, from childhood snaps to on-set shots to a photo with President Obama.

When buildings connected to the kids start blowing up and burning down, they band together to figure out the threat, their powers, and the mysterious people who are suddenly interested in finding them.
","Smart, engaging, thoughtful, and addictive, the story has a quick pacing and perfectly timed mystery that hits all the right notes. The Mighty Odds delves into the trials of middle school -- including bullying -- but layers in the particularly difficult issue of bullying based on a character's Middle Eastern descent.

Soon, Violet/Seraphina is on  the run from threatening agents who seem to want to harm her. Should she trust Zen or follow her own instincts?
","It's difficult to build a gripping novel around a protagonist/narrator with amnesia. A person in that condition can be too much of a blank slate to be compelling, and that's part of the problem with UNREMEMBERED. Violet/Seraphina is so nice, pretty, pliable, and vacant that it's hard to relate to her, especially after she begins to display abilities that are just shy of superpowers. Although there are some smartly choreographed action scenes and one or two intriguing plot twists, nearly everything in Unremembered could use a sharper edge. And the villain of the piece is so over-the-top that his presence lessens the impact of the cliffhanger ending.","Parents need to know that Unremembered is a fast-paced, science fiction adventure novel. The amnesiac protagonist is a little too one-dimensional in her bland niceness, but the book has some interesting plot twists and well-choreographed action set-pieces. The levels of violence, sexual content, and questionable language are all very low. The villains carry gun-like Modifiers that cause victims to pass out. There are no sexual encounters beyond kissing, and just one or two instances each of ""pissed,"" ""damn,"" and ""bitch.""

He teams up with Stefan, Mona, and Ditto, who have the same ability, and spend their nights seeking out and shooting the Parasites.
But nothing is as it appears. Stefan has a relationship with the corporation that runs the city and is chasing them, Ditto may not be leveling with them about his own motives, Mona is close to a local street gang, and the Parasites, and their deaths, may not be what they appear.

Wintergirls,"Disturbing, lauded eating disorder read; discuss with teens.","Eighteen-year-old Lia wakes up to learn her former best friend, Cassie, has killed herself. The night she died she called Lia 33 times, and Lia didn't answer. In fifth grade, they were best friends, so close they swore to help each other be the skinniest girls in high school. When their eating disorders spiral out of control and repeated stays in treatment centers don't help, Lia finally distances herself from Cassie. Even though Lia can't give up her obsession with losing weight, she hates herself and relieves some of her mental anguish by cutting and self-medication. Her parents try to help but are easily fooled into believing she is better, even after Cassie dies from bulimia. Cassie continues to encourage Lia to starve herself even after she is dead by haunting her; and Lia's guilt helps drive her down into one more bout of starvation that sends her to the hospital again, where she is committed and treated for mental illness.
","WINTERGIRLS is very painful to read and very, very powerful. It is not for the faint of heart, but fans of Laurie Halse Anderson may find it hard to resist. Teens will find it depressing -- parents will find it even more so -- but Anderson's beautiful and evocative writing will compel them to read to the end. Anderson says in an afterward that she wrote this book because of so many readers who asked her to write about eating disorders, cutting, and feeling lost. It's hard to imagine anyone doing a better job.
An innovative style of journal writing is used to further illustrate a troubled mind -- some pages are blank while others feature crossed out words. Lia references fairy tales and fairy tale images that will appeal especially to female readers. This story has more brutality than a fairy tale from the Grimm brothers.  As Lia says, there is no magic cure for girls like her, but there is a tiny, potent thimbleful of hope in the end.

He lives under the Morrison family cloud of fame, excess, and celebrity that shelters and imprisons him. There's also a big family secret looming that will rock his world -- and not in a good way. When Blade's dad's addiction screws up the biggest day of Blade's life, he makes a decision to cut loose from the family and the fame, and looks to a future with his girl, Chapel. Will Blade break free of the notoriety of being a Morrison? Will Chapel get free of her family? And is there any hope that Blade's dad will break free from his addiction? Family, secrets, fame, and music drive Blade to places he never imagined, including a little village in Ghana.
","This masterfully woven tale of forgiveness, family, music, and coming-of-age amid excess and secrets is a compelling book for these ""insta-celebrity"" times.

"Carry On: Simon Snow Series, Book 1","Harry Potter-like fantasy is funny, romantic, delightful.","CARRY ON is a spin-off with the fantasy characters whom author Rainbow Rowell created for her protagonist Cath to obsess over in Fangirl. An ode to Harry Potter, it's the story of Simon Snow, the most powerful young wizard of his age -- a ""Chosen One"" prophesied to defeat the mysterious Insidious Humdrum, a force that creates deadspots (places where no one can perform magic) throughout the magical world of the United Kingdom. In addition to having no idea if he will survive his destiny, Simon must deal with his brilliant but worried best friend Penelope; his mostly absentee mentor, the Mage; his overwhelmed girlfriend, Agatha, the prettiest girl at Watford School of Magicks; nd his roommate and nemesis, Baz -- who drives him crazy.
","Once readers get past the obvious Harry Potter parallels, they'll find this page-turning romance yet another winning and heartwarming story from Rainbow Rowell. There's something magical about Rowell's coming-of-age tales, so this expansion of Fangirl is brilliant. Featuring a diverse and compelling set of characters, Carry On works, because Rowell is such a natural, humorous storyteller who captures the feelings of first love and self-discovery. It may initially be hard not to think of Simon as Harry, Penelope as a combination of both Ron and Hermione (she's initially a redhead and comes from a huge middle-class family), and Watford as Hogwarts, but as the story continues, those similarities fall away, and Rowell takes Simon on his own original journey. And of course, since Rowell is an expert in the slow-burning romance, the love story here is far more central than all that blink-and-miss snogging at Hogwarts.
The strength of Carry On is that once again Rowell doesn't soft-peddle the confusion and frustration of being a teenager, something that's amplified tenfold for an orphaned wizard such as Simon Snow. Not only is Simon working through his uncontrollable magic that just ""goes off"" like a bomb, he's also pretty obviously captivated with Baz, who in turn has always been in love with Simon and used his snobbery and disdain to mask his attraction. In lesser hands, the whole magical-world-building, character development, and gay romance would've crumpled under the weight of too many story lines, but Rowell has imbued Carry On with so much depth and humor that readers will instantly want to reread it and once again cheer for Simon to earn a happily ever after.","Parents need to know that Carry On is best-selling author Rainbow Rowell's third young-adult novel, a fantasy spin-off of the story-within-a-story in Fangirl -- with her own twist. What started out as a tribute to Harry Potter in Fangirl gets its own fleshed-out final story in an imagined franchise. The book contains some fantasy/magical violence that kills or injures a few characters and threatens the magical world of the book. The central romance plays out between the protagonist and his male roommate, who share a few passionate kisses. Strong language is used throughout (including ""f--k"" and ""s--t""), and a couple of characters smoke cigarettes.

Escape! The Story of the Great Houdini,Engrossing Houdini bio by kids' author/magician.,"Children's author, magician, and friend of Bess Houdini (the magician's wife) Sid Fleischman sorts out the myths from the reality in the life of Harry Houdini.
Born Erich Weiss, son of a rabbi in Budapest, Hungary, in 1874, he emigrated to American as a small boy, and ended up in Appleton, Wisconsin, which he later claimed as his birthplace. Impoverished, Erich ran away from home at age 12, hoping to make enough money to send some back to his family.
But working at shining shoes, selling papers, and carrying messages earned him barely enough to scrape by. In his teens he began to study magic, and named himself after a famous French illusionist. Eventually he became the most famous magician, escape artist, and debunker of spiritualists of all time. Includes bibliography and index.
","Put this one on that special shelf -- so far, it's way too small -- of biographies that kids will actually get excited about.
Author Sid Fleischman has been a professional magician, and he knew the subject's wife. So he has both a personal and professional connection to his material, and it shows on nearly every page. In this lively, entertaining biography, Fleischman does more than just retell the major events of Houdini's life, and even more than separate myth from fact (a tricky job in this case). He carefully walks readers through the evidence and his own reasoning process, making good use of his insider knowledge along the way.
He includes numerous photographs, some from his personal collection published here for the first time. And he uses his well-known humor and some novelistic writing techniques to make this bio what all of them ought to be: an engrossing story. ","Parents need to know that there is little to be concerned with in this biography, other than the possibility that kids may try to reproduce Houdini's feats.

Determined to join him, Ebo refuses to be left behind and sets off on his own. Ebo does find his brother, but the boys will have to face all kinds of peril, across the Sahara Desert to the dangerous streets of Tripoli to the deadly waters that separate them from their ultimate destination.

The incident and continued bullying leave him unable to fully cope with life until he makes a friend, Johnny, who introduces him to rock, punk, and new wave music.

Jabberwocky,Classic poem played out on the basketball court.,"\""The Jabberwocky\"" poem by Lewis Carroll, written in nonsense words, is re-imagined here as a story about a 14-fingered beast who takes his prowess onto the basketball court. The beast is figuratively \""slain\"" by a beamish boy who takes him on in a game of one-on-one.
","With broad strokes, bright colors, and words that shout from the page, the inner city summer comes alive in this reinvention of the Jabberwocky. When Alice first heard the Jabberwocky in Through the Looking Glass, she didn't know what to think. ""It seems very pretty ... but it's rather hard to understand!"" she commented. And, most readers would agree, even in this new modern version set on an inner city basketball court. But somehow, through the rhythms and with a little help from the illustrations, even the youngest reader will get it.
In this version, re-imagined by the award-winning talent of Christopher Myers, nonsense makes sense. Though the words don't always fit the story perfectly, the rhythms pull them through, and Lewis Carroll's poem takes on the personality of an energetic rap song. And the basketball court seems the perfect setting. The 14-fingered basketball player who dominates the courts as well as the entire playground is as scary a Jabberwock monster as could be imagined. And, after the ""beamish"" boy challenges, and beats, him, the neighborhood celebrates: CALLOOH! CALLAY! as the hero struts off ""chort[ling] in his joy.""","Parents need to know that this poem written by Lewis Carroll is given a new twist on the basketball court, but it still hovers somewhere between silly nonsense and pure rhythmic genius.

Dear Martin,"Boy faces racial profiling in powerful, realistic tale.","In DEAR MARTIN, Justyce McAllister attends an exclusive private school with mostly white students. He's on the debate team, has some of the best grades in his class, and is certain he's headed to Yale. Then one night changes his life and puts him on a path that has him questioning why things happen and what he can do to change them. His Dear Martin project, in which he tries to live like Martin Luther King Jr., is put in jeopardy from the moment he's put in handcuffs. Tested by racist classmates, skeptical friends from his former neighborhood, and a rain of bullets, Justyce finds himself a target in the battle over police brutality and race. What would Martin do?
","Endearing and painfully realistic, this could be a news story any day in America. Dear Martin uthor Nic Stone manages not only to maintain the characters' humanity in what could easily become a paint-by-number pulled-from-the-headlines story, but also breathes  realness into each character so they become just like people readers already know. Stone moves beyond character archetypes into fully realized humans with a depth and fragility that's sometimes lost in current-events novels. From seeing the micro-aggressions nd posttraumatic stress brought on by a frightening encounter with the police, to experiencing the everyday details of first relationships and parental expectations, readers slip easily into Justyce's mind and feelings, truly going on this journey with him.
Dear Martin is told in an alternating mix of third-person narration, script-like dialogues, nd letters to Martin Luther King Jr. It's well-written, honest, and a gut punch that leaves readers thinking about it for weeks after reading it. ","Parents need to know that Nic Stone's Dear Martin tells the story of an Ivy League-bound African-American student named Justyce who becomes a victim of racial profiling. He struggles to reconcile the fact that he's a ""good kid"" with suddenly being in police handcuffs. In the months that follow, Justyce confronts injustices and micro-aggressions he experiences at his mostly white prep school and the fallout from his brief detainment. There's violence, including boys getting into fights with punches thrown and lips bloodied, police brutality, a teen shot, an officer killed offstage, and racist experiences. There's some swearing (including ""f--k"" and ""s--t""), teen drinking, and grief. Parents should be prepared to talk about current events, the Black Lives Matter movement, underage drinking, and stereotypes.

Blackout,Beautiful book captures the magic after lights go out.,"It's a typical hot, noisy night in the city. A child wants to play a board game, but everyone else in the family is too busy. Then the lights go out -- all across the city. Nothing works. The family leaves their sweltering apartment and heads to the roof, where the stars shine bright and their neighbors are having a ""block party in the sky."" Down below, kids splash in water from an open hydrant, enjoy free ice cream, and make music. When the lights come back on, everyone goes back to what they were doing before … until the young child clicks off the light. And the family gathers round for a board game by candlelight.
","In an age of digital distractions, a power outage is a major disruption -- and, as John Rocco illustrates in this beautiful picture book, a rare opportunity. Instead of pining for the mythical good old days, when people didn't spend hours a day staring at screens, this book shares the pleasure of powering down and enjoying the moment.
 Rocco's work is familiar to older readers who are fans of Rick Riordan: Rocco has illustrated the Percy Jackson, Kane Chronicles, and Heroes of Olympus series. In Blackout, his gorgeous artwork features strong lines and saturated colors. Comic-style panels and minimal text let the pictures speak for themselves.","Parents need to know that Blackout celebrates family and community coming together without distraction or devices.

"The Bronze Key: Magisterium, Book 3",Uneven magic-school threequel ends with jarring surprises.,"In The Bronze Key, Callum, Aaron, and Tamara are about to return to the Magisterium for their third year of magical training, but first they've been invited to an awards banquet in their honor. They convene at the impressive underwater Collegium with the usual fancy clothes and long speeches. Then, a chandelier in the trophy room falls, nearly impaling Callum, and a girl turns up dead in the water -- the same girl who delivered Callum a note moments before, supposedly from his sometimes-crush Celia, telling him to meet her alone in the trophy room. When they all get back to the Magisterium, the threats to Callum's life continue; someone is clearly trying to kill him, and Aaron and Tamara are determined to stop whoever it is. But trying to find the spy introduces more danger.
","The third in this team-written series continues to suffer from the same lack of cohesion and flow -- but, just like the others, it delivers a powerful finish. The Bronze Key meanders like the underground halls of the Magisterium, not quite developing secondary characters or a sense of rhythm of the life of the school; readers see one test, a few trips to the cafeteria, and two or three scenes of magical training, making it feel like less than a real school experience.
Despite that: Wow! What a surprising finish. Even readers who may have felt cheated along the way will be picking up Book 4, because they won't believe what they just read. Authors Holly Black and Cassandra Clare have delivered their A game before in other series, so here's hoping the new, shocking developments will breathe life into future installments.","Parents need to know that The Bronze Key is the third book in the Magisterium series by accomplished fantasy writers Holly Black (Doll Bones) and Cassandra Clare (City of Bones). Both often write for a teen audience, but this series about a magic school is aimed at tweens. After the main character delivered a severed head to the mages at his magic school in Book 2, readers may be expecting more jarring violence. They get it here with -- spoiler alert -- an unexpected death. Also, the students reanimate a corpse enough to talk to it after it shows up floating in water with a dagger in its back. A chandelier nearly crushes students, an air elemental with teeth attacks, a student falls and breaks a leg, crazed animals attack -- including bears that maul and get sliced with a dagger -- and people are knocked out magically with a ""soul touch."" While Callum and friends work to find out who's trying to hurt Callum, they put themselves in danger repeatedly, usually against the wishes of their teachers, and pay a serious price for it in the end.

"TodHunter Moon, Book 1: PathFinder",Spin-off with brave girl best for loyal Septimus Heap fans.,"Tod is 12 and finally old enough to hear the secret of her people, the PathFinders. At a special dawn ceremony, her father reveals that their ancestors were renowned for navigating something called the Ancient Ways, paths they no longer remember. Because of their skills, they were even sent to the stars. And, even crazier, many of the PathFinders today could still have gills like their ancestors who traveled in fluid through space. This is a lot for Tod to take in, and she has little time to process it before her father goes missing from his fishing boat one day. He leaves a note behind telling Tod yet more secrets. Her long-deceased mother had magical abilities and wanted her to study magic. Tod hops on a ship to meet Extraordinary Wizard Septimus Heap, not knowing that her village is in serious danger. Fires burn down most of the houses and most of the villagers go missing at the hands of strange nocturnal snake-like creatures called garmin. But Tod still has a chance to help them when the garmin start abducting people near the Magical Tower and Septimus finds out they're sneaking around through the Ancient Ways. The kidnapped will need Tod's help as a Pathfinder to navigate through the labyrinth of tunnels and save them on time.
","For a book about people called PathFinders, this oddly meanders a lot; it lacks a clear structure and objective for its heroic characters until close to the end. Which can be pretty hard on the reader, especially those not fully engaged in the Septimus Heap world already (this reviewer read the first four Septimus Heap books and still got a little lost).
If readers have read all previous books and are loyal fans, they'll really like Tod regardless of story structure problems. She's a brave tomboy character who has some pretty cool skills to contribute if she decides to study magic.","Parents need to know that TodHunter Moon, Book 1: PathFinder is a spin-off of the Septimus Heap Series. Readers will be much more comfortable getting into the story if they've read the other series first. Septimus Heap, his brothers and sisters, and his whole magical world are still present and barely explained. A brave girl named Tod is at the center of the new series. Her father goes missing right off the bat and much of her fishing village is destroyed by fire as the people are rounded up and enslaved by walking, nocturnal snakelike creatures call garmin. Tod gets kidnapped by the garmin and saved, and she and her brave companions try to get their loved ones back before they're threatened with drowning. A young boy's life is threatened repeatedly.

Tales From Africa,"These tales educate, entertain, and entrance.","Twelve new stories, commissioned from contemporary African storytellers, come from all over the continent and cover the gamut from traditional animal fables to comical cautionary tales.

 ","Storytelling is alive and well on that continent of mystery and magic, Africa; these 12 tales are rich in the diversity of land, people, and style. Mary Medlicott, who has also edited The King With Dirty Feet, has compiled a thought-provoking and well-balanced look at the concerns and hopes of the ancient and emerging lands of the African continent.
As she says in her editor's note, when these stories are told, the listening is loud. One that really speaks out is ""The Bittersweet Hunter and the Deer-woman,"" an offering from Nigeria in which love and kindness triumph over meanness, jealousy, and gossip. The illustrations, by African artist Ademola Akintola, capture the vibrant color and energy of diverse cultures. For the most part, though, they don't capture the abundant dramatic moments of the stories.","Parents need to know that some of the 12 stories focus on animals and natural elements that come alive, some on people and their relationships with each other or the natural world, and some on the magic and reality of life in Africa.

Suicide Notes from Beautiful Girls,"Lurid violence and body count mount in grim, dark thriller.","High school juniors June and Delia used to be best friends and had an almost telepathic relationship. Then, about a year ago, things went weird and they've hardly spoken. But when June, along with the rest of the school, gets the shocking news that Delia has committed suicide, she's sure it's not true and that her onetime BFF was murdered. As she pursues a relentless quest for the truth, it gets harder and harder to know what's real -- or whom to trust.
","Fans of the dark side will appreciate the moral ambiguity in this fast-moving tale of a relatively innocent teen girl trying to do the right thing in an increasingly dangerous, untrustworthy world. Others may find SUICIDE NOTES FROM BEAUTIFUL GIRLS too lurid or too profoundly hopeless.
Told in alternating present-day and flashback segments, it effectively establishes the characters and their complex motivations, while offering a glimpse of pure evil, making it more akin to a horror tale than most thrillers.","Parents need to know that, besides several violent deaths, Suicide Notes from Beautiful Girls is packed with sex (same- and opposite-sex), drinking, drugging, deception, and seriously toxic relationships. The thrilling, twist-laden plot as a teen tries to discover the truth about her friend's death will make this book hard for many readers to put down, but by the time it's delivered its last shock, they'll have traveled through some pretty dark places.

","This enlightening book pushes kids to think critically about the Harry Potter books, a lesson that can be extended into everything they read. Remind kids of that when they realize there's life after the last page of Deathly Hallows.
These Potterphiles do know their stuff. And this is their Prior Incantatem -- pulling past books and J.K. Rowling quotes out of their wands and breaking them down one theme at a time. But like the spell, the book's magic is fleeting -- pick it up before the hype is over, or don't bother. Perhaps that's why this book didn't come from a big publishing house or get a polished treatment. The chapter headers are grainy-looking, a few typos are noticeable, and the array of fonts on the cover is a little tacky. But that's not all that important.
The nice thing here is that the authors' evidence is presented clearly -- even the stuff they don't agree with. (For example, there are still some fans out there who think Dumbledore is alive and well, so the authors humor these fans with a few clues that they could be right.) That said, for casual fans, some things will seem like they're coming from left field (like the Lily-Snape connection) -- until MuggleNet states their case.

","Folks on both sides of the political aisle who admire the vibrancy of the Cuban people will relish this warm family story about a road trip to Havana to celebrate the birth of a new baby cousin. All the Way to Havana paints a picture of a rural Cuban family and their inventive ingenuity in keeping their pre-Cuban Revolution 1954 Chevy running. Author Margarita Engle plays with sounds in the rural village where baby chicks chirp ""pío pío,"" and the rickety car engine sputters ""cara cara."" Embedded in her story are lessons about a society that's not endlessly disposable nd that enjoys life's simple pleasures.
Illustrator Mike Curato traveled to Cuba to research the art, and it shows. The family, retro cars, and street scenes are lovingly rendered using a combination of pencil drawing, painting, and textures added from photos. He is as skilled at depicting the stately old buildings of the capital as he is the warm brown faces of the Cuban people, making this a beautiful, nearly keepsake portrait of the colorful island nation.","Parents need to know that All the Way to Havana by Cuban-American poet and Newbery Honoree Margarita Engle (The Surrender Tree: Poems of Cuba's Struggle for Freedom), and illustrated by Mike Curato (Little Elliot, Big City), is a loving account of a family road trip in Cuba. When a rural family wants to visit their Havana cousins to celebrate the birth of a new baby, they first have to repair the engine on their rattletrap 1954 Chevy. Though there's no mention of the 1959 revolution or resultant U.S. embargo, it's clear that the island doesn't have access to shiny new cars or other consumer goods, and we see the people cleverly and creatively fix what they have. The family and neighbors are warm and friendly, and the very detailed art paints a vivid picture of Cuba, its people, and its roads filled with ""noisy old cars of every color.""

"Winter: The Lunar Chronicles, Book 4",Blockbuster finale to addictive sci-fi fairy-tale series.,"Evil Queen Levana does not take kindly to watching her groom, Emperor Kai, get kidnapped on their wedding day. She immediately launches all-out war on Earth and attacks Kai's palace. Kai and his friendly kidnappers -- Cinder, the rightful queen of Luna; Cress, an expert hacker; Captain Thorne, an ex-thief; and Wolf, an ex-special operative in Levana's army -- must think of a plan fast. It involves getting Kai to Luna for a wedding and coronation do-over and sneaking Cinder and friends onto the moon in the process. Cinder hopes revealing herself to her people will start the revolution needed to end Levana's reign, save Earth from ruin, and save her friends in the process. Their friend Scarlet, taken weeks before by the Lunars, is held in a cage in the palace. She'll need more than her friends' help to get free. She'll need Winter, Levana's beautiful and mad stepdaughter whom the queen jealously despises more than anyone else on Luna or Earth.
","If you're a fan of the Lunar Chronicles series and of massive, epic endings, then expect this 800-page-plus finale to really satisfy. With that many pages in WINTER, expect no subplot to go unexamined; no romantic interlude to go by without a hearty amount of swooning and intensity after couples are reunited, separated, and reunited again; no battle scene without some serious slo-mo mind-control bloodshed and gravitas; and no wedding gown in a throne room to go unbloodied. You get the idea. Big, sweeping stuff.
For readers who don't like both the sci-fi/action and romance pieces equally, you may find yourself overwhelmed by one or the other. Even fans of both will find a moment or two thinking they wish Cinder would just storm the castle already. But it's all good, careful storytelling and it all intertwines beautifully in the end. Happily ever after, of course.","Parents need to know that Winter is the finale of Marissa Meyer's bestselling Lunar Chronicles series that features major sci-fi twists on well-known fairy tales. You'll need to read the first three -- Cinder, Scarlet, and Cress -- to keep up. Reading the prequel Fairest, written between Cress and Winter, isn't essential, but it definitely puts the motivations of evil Queen Levana of Luna (the moon) in perspective before readers dig into this Snow White reimagining. All of Luna is at war by the end of this 800-plus-pager. It's a nastier business with scary, genetically enhanced soldiers who partially eat their enemies and enemies who can control minds and make whole waves of oncoming opposition turn on each other with guns and knives. Many, many end up dead. Numerous times friends turn on friends and stab or shoot them because their minds are being controlled. Wounds are serious and almost kill main characters. There's also a near-drowning, bio warfare, and people shot at random in a town square. Each of the stories adds a fairy-tale couple, so expect four passionate-reunion-style kisses and a few other smooches mixed in. All female characters remain strong and at the center of the series. Even Winter, the new female hero here, who at first seems like she's too much weakened by madness, shows that it's caused by her strong resolve not to use her Lunar gift of manipulation against others; she'd rather have reoccurring violent hallucinations than be like her stepmother, Levana.

Night,Unforgettable memoir of teen who survived the Holocaust.,"As NIGHT begins, Wiesel is living with his family in Sighet, a town which was then part of Hungary. Deeply religious, he spends his mornings studying the Talmud and his evenings in the local synagogue. For most of Sighet, the war seems far away and there is confidence that the Russian Army will arrive before the town falls to the Nazis. But in the spring of 1944, the Germans arrive and the entire Jewish population is soon loaded onto the cattle cars that will transport them to Nazi death camps. After they arrive at Auschwitz, Wiesel and his father are separated from his mother and sisters but manage to remain together during the nightmare months that follow. As the Russians approach Auschwitz, the prisoners are forced on a deadly march through winter snows before being taken by train to Buchenwald. It is there that Wiesel's father dies, in circumstances that will forever haunt him. ","Harrowing, heartbreaking, and brutal, this unforgettable memoir of a teenage survivor of Auschwitz and Buchenwald is essential reading for anyone studying the Holocaust. Elie Wiesel tells his story in a voice that is quiet and spare. Only the most essential words are needed to describe the horrors he witnessed. Wiesel has stated that Night begins where Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl ends. For teens whose knowledge of the Holocaust goes no further than the young Dutch girl who wrote, ""In spite of everything I still believe that people are really good at heart,"" Night may be hard to process  emotionally. For all readers, it could help begin difficult discussions about the nature of good and evil in the world. ","Parents need to know that the late Elie Wiesel's Night is one of the most widely read and accaimed Holocaust memoirs. Wiesel was 15 when he, his three sisters, and his parents were sent to Auschwitz. In spare prose, Wiesel recounts the unimaginable horrors of life in Auschwitz and Buchenwald and the loss of his deeply held religious faith. ""Never shall I forget that night, the first night in camp, which has turned my life into one long night, seven times cursed and seven times sealed.” While Night is assigned reading in middle and high schools around the world, parents should be aware that the violence and brutality in the book are shocking and often unceasing. For speaking out against injustice, violence, and repression, Wiesel was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986.

Ninth House,"YA author's adult fantasy has lots of  drugs, sex, violence.","In NINTH HOUSE, when Alex nearly dies in a drug den, it turns into her salvation, or so she thinks. She wakes up in a hospital bed with the dean of Yale sitting next to her. He offers her a place at the Ivy League school and at the House of Lethe. Her whole life she's been able to see ghosts -- or Greys, as they call them -- and the House of Lethe needs her unique skill set. Alex's Lethe mentor is Darlington, a Yale senior who knows how all the magical societies on campus work, what specialized and often bloody rites they perform, and how to oversee them so everything is safe and secret, and all the Grey energy that surrounds them is contained. Darlington doesn't have long to teach Alex before he disappears and she's told to cover it up. Just like she's told to look away when a woman from town, a drug dealer, is stabbed to death near campus. But Alex can sense this is a cover up as well, and the deeper she digs, the more trouble she courts -- from Yale's secret societies with too much to lose, and from enemies on both sides of the Veil that she can't even fathom.
","This phenomenal and mature adult debut from a popular young adult author Leigh Bardugo is more twisty-turny-absorbing mystery than spine-tingling ghost story. Half the time, the ghosts that main character Alex see are just a nuisance to deal with. She's been bothered by the ""Greys,"" and sometimes harmed and harassed them, her whole life. She forms a bond with one ghost, reluctantly, to solve a crime she knows the university is covering up. The more she digs, the more fascinating the story gets. It takes the reader in myriad directions: to many of the secret societies, a frat house, a prison, a drug den, a professor's salon, a warded safe house with a magic library, and even on the other side of the Veil. And the whole time she's missing her mentor, the gentlemanly and chivalrous Darlington, who's disappeared. What happened to him could be even worse than what she imagined, and is yet another intriguing layer of Ninth House.
Without Darlington, and with constant threats around her, Alex has no choice but to cast off her new Yale persona she's tried so hard to cultivate. It may help her fit in, but it's the grit and resilience she learned in her drug dealing years that will save her now. This Alex is reckless and impulsive and gets things done. Readers will be scared for her every minute as the pages fly by.","Parents need to know that Ninth House is the first book for adults by popular young adult fantasy author Leigh Bardugo (The Grisha Trilogy, Six of Crows, Wonder Woman: Warbringer). Her teen fans will know about it -- it's marketed to them as well. If you have an older, mature teen reader already well versed in R movies with lots of mature content, this may be OK for them. There's a whole lot of drug use (the main character was a former user and dealer and her best friend died of an overdose), sexual content, and violence, especially jarring sexual violence with a date rape drug and a video passed around to add to the humiliation. A mental patient is kidnaped and cut open for a magic ritual. People are injured and die in gruesome scenes, including a stabbing and the bludgeoning with a baseball bat (described with ""chips of skull and brain flying""). Language stays pretty salty as well, with frequent use of ""f--k"" nd lots of sexualized banter, some tame and some cruel. The main character, Alex, had a difficult past and uses the tenacity she's developed to seek justice for those wronged, and she's pretty merciless about it. If this is not a fit for your teen just yet, try the similarly themed Truly Devious and Shades of London series, both a bit tamer, and both by Maureen Johnson.

My Pen,Energetic sketches show the power of one boy's pen.,"Through a series of pen-and-ink sketches, Aurelio, a young, gentle, dark-eyed boy in a fedora, uses his pen to express his imagination, create stories, and empower himself. His thought-provoking drawings flow dynamically across each page, accompanied by one or two lines of text that tell just what that pen is trying to do. The boy rides a dinosaur, tap-dances upside-down on the clouds, and wears satellite sneakers with computer laces. He spots n elephant nestled in a teacup, writes stories in the margins of his sketchpad, and sails a newspaper boat to Africa. His pen does make mistakes nd hides from him at times, but it also helps him face his fears and insecurities.
","Energetic, sensitive, incredible pen-and-ink drawings create a mesmerizing celebration of self-expression and imagination in this boy's story about the power of his pen. The narrative may be too loosely connected for some, the beginning a little confusing, and some segments not appropriate for younger readers. However, most of the simple text is both fun and poetic, and the message comes across loud and clear: Imagination, self-expression, creativity, and art make even the smallest person more powerful.
School-age kids and adults will find THE PEN fascinating. Author-illustrator Christopher Myers fills his pages with tiny details that are just plain fun, and he dedicates his book ""[t]o the people who make things, and to the people who share them."" His book surely will encourage and inspire readers to pick up their pens and express themselves. ","Parents need to know that My Pen, by award-winning author-illustrator Christopher Myers (Firebird), celebrates self-expression and imagination through black-and-white sketches nd encourages us all to pick up a pen and create. The drawings are sensitive and expressive, almost eloquent at times. The message is inspirational, although the story is loosely connected at best nd includes examples that may not be appropriate for younger picture-book readers. One spread about war especially is geared toward older kids. Myers dedicates this book to people who make things nd honors both of his parents: his mother, Constance Myers, who taught him to draw, and his father, the late author Walter Dean Myers, for whom he illustrated the Caldecott Honor Book Harlem.

The Year of the Beasts,Prose and comics mix in intense tale of sibling rivalry.,"In THE YEAR OF THE BEASTS, 15-year-old Tessa starts the summer planning to explore her attraction to Charlie, but she's surprised when it's her younger sister, Lulu, who begins spending time with the handsome football player. Tessa has her own admirer in Jasper, a shy loner, but the intensity of her jealousy toward her sister grows unabated. Meanwhile, a comics story about the Greek gorgon Medusa and her curse of turning those she loves into stone offers tantalizing clues about Tessa and Lulu's fates.
","The Year of the Beasts is a tender, affecting, and hard-hitting tale of teen romance and jealousy. Cecil Castellucci ably captures the giddiness and angst of first love, and her depiction of the interplay between two competing sisters and their group of friends always feels psychologically honest. Nate Powell's illustrated sections comment obliquely on the prose chapters, until everything coalesces in one devastating incident at the book's climax. The Year of the Beasts might upset some sensitive readers, but it earns its emotional ending.","Parents need to know that The Year of the Beasts mixes sections of prose and comics to tell complementary tales of romantic exploration and loss. The narrative moves inexorably toward tragedy, but the emotional pain involved isn't gratuitous and ultimately leads to an understanding of kindness and forbearance. There's some kissing and making out, a swimming accident, and, in the comics section, the Medusa character inadvertently turns her parents, teachers, and classmates to stone with her snaky gaze.

Asking for It,"Haunting, harrowing story of rape, consent, blame, shame.","Just after her 18th birthday, Emma goes to a party at a friend's house. All the usual crowd are there, and all eyes are on the beautiful Emma. But Emma's becoming increasingly stifled by small-town life and is tired of everyone thinking they know who she really is. So in addition to the usual excessive drinking, Emma unexpectedly takes some pills from the guy she wants to hook up with. The next thing she knows, she wakes up in very bad shape on her own front porch with no more than a vague memory from the night before. Later she learns that a Facebook page was created with dozens of graphic photos and videos showing that she was repeatedly raped by the town's well-liked sports heroes while she was unconscious. Branded a whore and worse, Emma and everyone else is asking if she deserved what she got and if she was ASKING FOR IT. How can she prove she didn't consent? And how can she possibly put her and her family's lives back together after everyone has seen those horrible photos?
","This harrowing examination of sex and sexual assault for teens and young adults is a great starting place for teens to think and talk about these issues and how they affect their own lives. Rather than laying out answers, O’Neill illustrates the questions we should be asking about rape, consent, victim blaming, and so much more that it deserves the broadest possible audience and to be widely discussed by teens, parents, and educators.
With the precision of a scalpel, O’Neill delicately carves out the subtlest ways Emma learns that beauty is supreme and with equal accuracy hammers home the double standard that still applies to both women and men. The images are haunting, the topic is difficult, and the ending is frustrating yet sadly all too believable.","Parents need to know that 2017 Michael J. Printz Honor Book Asking for It, by Irish author Louise O'Neil (Only Ever Yours), is about a teen girl in Ireland who's gang-raped after drinking and taking pills and falling unconscious at a party; then pictures and videos of this violent scene are posted on Facebook. The novel takes on the difficult topics of rape and consent in harrowing fashion. The violent imagery is haunting, and the book doesn't provide answers. But it raises a lot of questions that should be talked about by parents and teens about rape, consent, double standards, victim blaming, social media, what gives a person value to society, how to instill respect for self and others in children and teens, and so much more. Teens and young adults frequently drink lots of different kinds of alcohol to excess at parties, often including stolen cough syrup. They raid parents' medicine cabinets and take unspecified prescription drugs while drinking, later speculated to be MDMA (ecstasy). There are disturbing, detailed descriptions of the posted pictures and videos of the gang assault and rape of an unconscious victim; they're not gory, but images from the pictures are mentioned frequently. (The phrase “pink flesh, splayed legs” is repeated often as the memory of the photos flash through Emma's mind, though she has no memory of actual events.) There are no consequences for the perpetrators, but the victim feels she's ruined everyone's lives. There are suicide attempts that ren't narrated in detail. A past rape is vaguely discussed. Author O'Neill expresses the hope in the afterword that talking about these matters will lead to a society in which sexual assault is rare. Parents and teens will benefit from this framework for thinking and talking about the difficult issues raised.

"The Hunters: Brotherband Chronicles, Book 3",Teen sailors chase cruel pirate captain in exciting sequel.,"After Hal, captain of the Heron, and his shipmates wage a big battle against Zavac, the pirate captain, in the town of Limmat, Zavac makes a narrow escape. It's so frighteningly narrow, he decides he deserves some R&R in the pirate haven of Raguza, a town on the Dan River. Zavac knows the Heron and her crew are in hot pursuit and sets out to stop them at every turn, bribing corrupt officials in river towns to imprison and hang them and forcing them to take a very dangerous detour. Just when Zavac thinks he's lost them for good, Hal hatches another one of his brilliant plans that involves a bit of trickery, some fancy ship maneuvering, and his secret fighting weapon -- it's not called \""the Mangler\"" for nothing.
","THE HUNTERS is an all-out chase and showdown; it starts slowly like the first two books, but readers don't have to wait around too long for another of Hal's brilliant plans. And this time he's a bit more confident and so is his crew. When they walk right into a lion's den -- or rather, sail into a whole port full of pirates -- you're almost afraid for the pirates. Didn't these guys used to be the scrawny underdogs?
	While readers wait for the main action to ramp up, they get to know Lydia and her many talents. Heron's new recruit is an expert tracker, a long-range weapons expert, and a bit of an escape artist, and thank goodness for the Heron brotherband this sister's got their back. ","Parents need to know that The Hunters is the third book in Brotherband Chronicles, the companion series to the popular Ranger's Apprentice series. The teen shipmates of the Heron are still at sea and facing pirates, so expect some battle scenes, but the focus is more on action and strategy than gory detail. That's even the case when young Hal, the admirable, brave, and incredibly bright ship captain, gets beat up by a town leader's thugs. There are some pirate casualties from battle and drowning. The boys get a few cuts, are imprisoned and almost tried and hanged, and one almost dies from fever from a battle injury incurred in Book 2. The Heron goes through a series of rapids that almost destroy the ship. As always, Hal's shipmates make a great team and will face any danger with him. A girl shipmate, Lydia -- introduced in Book 2, The Invaders -- becomes a powerful force to reckon with here, saving the day more than once.

Will Sparrow's Road,Colorful characters bring Elizabethan fair to life.,"Newbery medalist Karen Cushman's WILL SPARROW'S ROAD is a historical novel that takes place in Elizabethan England. Young Will's father exchanged his son for ale, and Will is on the run, having escaped the innkeeper who now owns him. Will has no family or friends, no boots, and no money. He vows to live as a liar and thief, telling himself he will trust no one and will care only for himself and his own belly. Fearful of being found and taken back to the innkeeper, or his father, Will tries to keep a low profile, eating whatever he can steal or find growing along his way. Eventually, he falls in with a troupe of hucksters led by Master Tidball, who hires Will to verbally advertise the ""oddities and prodigies"" (strange creatures in jars, a half-cat half-girl, a three-legged chicken) that fair-goers can view for a penny. Traveling from fair to fair, Will meets a host of colorful characters -- and learns to trust his true friends.
","Will Sparrow's Road isn't the fantastical, action-packed novel that many modern middle-grade readers are accustomed to. There's some tension and suspense when Will and his friends find themselves in sticky situations, but mainly this is a touching, fascinating story about some colorful characters, and about a historical time and place. Boys and rirls will identify with Will; they'll worry about him when he's hungry or in danger, and feel his sadness when he says good-bye to Duchess.

"The Earth, My Butt, and Other Big Round Things",Funny overweight girl goes through some heavy stuff.,"Overweight Virginia thinks she's a misfit in her family, with two thin, gorgeous, successful parents and two thin, gorgeous, high-achieving older siblings. Her mother pressures her to lose weight, which she tries to do. But her anxiety leads her to minor acts of self-mutilation, as she tries to live by her Fat Girl Code of Conduct, which operates on the basic assumption that she is worthless. Then her brother, Byron, whom she idolizes, is suspended from college for date rape, and Virginia begins to see both her family and herself in a different light.
 
","Readers, especially teen girls, will likely relate to Virginia, and they will certainly respect her growing ability to stand up for herself. Though this book could use a bit more scathing humor -- and a deeper exploration of some of the more serious issues it raises -- Mackler is able to impart a message of self-acceptance through her self-deprecating narrator. Readers will appreciate the emails and journal entries that add realism to Virginia's coming-of-age story.
 

  ","Parents need to know that this book deals with some sensitive subjects, such as self-injury, eating disorders, and controlling parents. Most importantly, Virginia discovers that the brother she has always admired is guilty of date rape.

Parents may not always appreciate Virginia's choices  -- like getting her eyebrow pierced without permission -- but she is a character that teens can relate to, and they will certainly respect her growing ability to stand up for herself.

Through all kinds of hardship, Samuel perseveres, sure he'll one day be reunited with Joshua.
","Finding a new perspective on slavery in America is a daunting task, but author Jon Walter proves more than capable in this sharply detailed and immersive account of one boy's struggle to survive. As freeborn Samuel copes with the enormity of being sold into slavery in Mississippi, his ordeal illuminates the resilience of the human spirit.

Not Afraid of Dogs,"Sweet, poignant story of overcoming fear.","""I'm the bravest boy of all!"" says Daniel. But he is afraid of dogs. ""I'm not afraid of dogs,"" says Daniel. ""I just don't like them."" So he avoids them as best he can, even climbing up a lamppost to avoid a dog-walker.
But when his mother agrees to take care of his aunt's dog while she travels, avoiding it becomes even harder. He locks himself in his room, and refuses to come out even for dinner. ""He's afraid,"" says his sister. ""Am not!"" yells Daniel from his room. But a midnight trip to the bathroom during a thunderstorm, only to find the terrified dog huddled behind the toilet, brings out a feeling in Daniel stronger than his fear: compassion.

This happens most poignantly in the confrontation between boy and dog, when Daniel's compassion for the terrified dog wins out over his fear and, in a beautiful spread, he drops to his knees to gather the dog into his arms, both of their hearts pounding. This provides a surprisingly strong climax to an already lovely book sure to be cherished by both dog lovers and those who maybe have a bit of fear of their own.","Parents need to know that there is nothing to be concerned about in this book, which won the Society of Children's Book Writers & Illustrators' Golden Kite Award for Illustrations.

It tells the story of a little girl who ""was born the color of midnight"" and feels she's treated differently than her lighter-skinned friends and family members because of it. The tale takes a magical turn when a star comes in her bedroom and takes her on a journey explaining the mythological origins of Day and Night -- who are sisters. After learning about the value and beauty of the dark night, she can embrace her dark skin, and feels ""beautiful inside and out!"" In an author's note at the end, Nyong'o, who was raised in Kenya, explains how she drew on her own experience to write this book: ""Much like Sulwe, I got teased and taunted bout my night-shade skin. ... Yes, it is important to feel good about yourself when you look in the mirror, but what is even more important is working to be beautiful inside.""  The book was also named a 2020 Coretta Scott King (Illustrator) Honor Book for Vashti Harrison's illustrations.

Old Bear,"Gentle tale of one bear's hopeful, playful dreams.","As a lumbering, cuddly brown bear hunkers down for his long winter hibernation, he dreams he is a cub again, frolicking through the four seasons and all the pleasures they bring. Finally, he awakes and can hardly believe his eyes when he walks out into a blossoming spring world.
","Any book by Kevin Henkes is worth having, and this one is no exception. With the usual broad outlines and familiar watercolors, Henkes has filled OLD BEAR with striking illustrations that give the simple tale a tone as beautiful and pleasant as the world Old Bear loves. His dream world is filled with giant pink crocuses and butterfly leaves of spring, blueberries that fall from the sky during a summer rain. Splashes of orange, yellow, and red fill the autumn world with salmon, birds, and leaves, and the winter world blazes with icy stars that fill the sky like fireworks.
It's easy to understand why Henkes has been called a genius because of the masterful way he merges simple, poignant stories with expressive, colorful paintings. His books have been awarded the Caldecott medal as well as New York Times Book Review honors. Though Old Bear may not be the best of his best, it's definitely a book worth sharing.","Parents need to know that is a beautiful book about a bear, the seasons, and dreams he has about things he loves.

The Clique Summer Collection: Massie,Rich-girl series is so materialistic it hurts.,"Massie Block starts the summer before eighth grade at riding camp, only to be kicked out when she gets caught pulling a stunt to try to win a competition. When her parents tell her she has to pay them back for the money they lost on the camp, she takes a job as a makeup rep for a new cosmetics company with a ""beauty's on the inside"" philosophy. Ignoring her training DVDs, Massie finds she's a lot more successful when she tells girls they're ugly and need to fix themselves. Suddenly business is booming. It's all going well until the company's president drops in to see Massie's selling techniques first-hand.
","This book is $6.99 -- real girls should save their hard-earned babysitting money for a better beachy read.
This series releases one book a month during the summer of 2008; the first one -- MASSIE -- hit the top of the bestseller list right away. Kids who love reality shows and news about celebs like Paris Hilton will dive right in. The author tries to add humor in the fact that girls like Massie will never change, but it's not clever enough or scathing enough to be truly funny. And wouldn't it be nicer if she really learned from her mistakes? Then you could actually root for Massie in the end instead of wishing she'd suffer some crueler fate.
The worst part of the book is the way it's written. If you stripped out all mentions of designer brands, the book would be half the length (and that's barely an exaggeration). What's left is a bunch of text-messaging slang, catty comments stepped up with pop culture references, and a description of a very improbable summer job for an eighth grader. Oh, and she earns enough to pay back her parents for a summer of riding camp in just one week. Right. ","Parents need to know that if they're on the fence about whether to let tweens read this book series, the best test is whether you think reality shows about out-of-touch rich girls are out of line or harmless fun (think My Super Sweet 16). This is the book equivalent. There's no real sex, drug-related, or violent content like in the Gossip Girl series. The main character is in middle school and focused on shopping, winning, and telling other girls that they're ugly so she can sell makeup at her summer job. When there's a lesson to be learned (winning isn't everything, beauty is on the inside), part of the humor is supposed to be that Massie will never change. This is a quick beach read and the first in the Clique summer series; each girl in Massie's ""Pretty Committee"" will get her own book -- one a month from April to August 2008.

Conspiracy of Blood and Smoke,"Less mystery, more romance as Hitler consolidates power.","Having escaped Hitler's clutches in Prisoner of Night and Fog, Gretchen and Daniel have been hiding in England under assumed names for the past 18 months. In the meantime, Hitler has risen to national prominence in Germany and been named chancellor. Events there draw Daniel back to Germany, this time to Berlin, where he's been falsely accused of murder. Gretchen soon follows to help, despite the danger of being recognized as one of Hitler's former favorites. Can they find the real killer, clear Daniel's name, escape Hitler's notice, and get back out of Germany safely?
","The historical events that serve as a backdrop provide a lot of food for thought, and the lively, engaging characters and compelling events will draw teens in and keep the pages turning. Suspense, particularly in the stronger second half, is surprisingly well maintained despite the reader knowing that one of the heroes' main objectives (bringing down Hitler) is doomed to fail.
CONSPIRACY OF BLOOD AND SMOKE has a lot of the same strengths as its prequel, Prisoner of Night and Fog: danger, excitement, and relatable characters grappling with coming of age at a crucial turning point in history. But added melodrama (finding the real killer will bring down the National Socialist Party and disgrace Hitler) weaken the structure; the murder mystery becomes less compelling as it's swept up into other events; nd phrases such as ""the familiar feel of his lips on hers"" make it read more like a romance.
 ","Parents need to know that Conspiracy of Blood and Smoke continues the story, begun in Prisoner of Night and Fog, of a girl who grew up a favorite pet of Adolf Hitler. The author catches the reader up on past events quickly, but it'll be enjoyed better by those who've read the first book. It's a good way to get teens thinking about the causes of World War II, especially about how the National Socialist Party became so strong nd how Hitler acquired dictatorial powers. A lot of beatings are described briefly, some guns are fired, blood's mentioned but not described in detail, and once injuries from torture are described in detail. Kisses and sensations of attraction are described briefly. Young women working as prostitutes take cocaine as an escape, and a close friend of the protagonist uses habitually. Main characters don't smoke, but there are frequent mentions of others smoking and of cigar nd cigarette smells.

Tasty Baby Belly Buttons: A Japanese Folktale,Japanese tale is reinvented with humor.,"Little conquers big! Big monsters munch baby belly buttons, but a little girl defeats a gang of them and rescues a bunch of babies. Read-aloud audiences will love pointing at the amusing pictures and shouting that fun, bounce-off-your-lips phrase: ""Tasty baby belly buttons!""
 ","Meilo So's wild, swirling lines and unusual greens and oranges help create an otherworldly setting that matches the timeless folktale narrative. Picture-book audiences wiggle with mild fear when the author brings on the terrible oni. In well-timed passages, she eases the tension by highlighting tender moments between the old Japanese couple and Uriko.
The pages almost turn by themselves as Uriko marches off in her tall wooden sandals to find the monsters who have kidnapped the town's babies. The energy comes to a climax in the slapstick scene in which Uriko and her friends outmaneuver the fat-bellied oni. The only problematic aspect to this original telling of an old Japanese tale is in the foreign phrases that do not correspond to sounds English-speaking children understand. Some readers enjoy the unfamiliar phrases, but others are distracted by the sounds.","Parents need to know that the monsters that make off with a bunch of babies may worry some little ones.

Ella Sarah has a clear idea of how she wants to look and she is determined to have her own way. Later, her young friends arrive for a tea party and all are attired just as zanily as Ella Sarah. She is happily vindicated.
","Simply and delightfully told, the story will resonate with preschoolers and their families. Every parent and older sibling will recognize Ella Sarah's struggle between dependence and independence, and applaud her family's decision to give Ella Sarah a little growing room.
Bold pastel colors in attractive patterns are applied in a variety of printmaking techniques to create a sunny background for Ella Sarah's dressing drama.

The Other Girl: A Midvale Academy Novel,"Fun prep school story, but full of racy content.","This is a follow-up to Miller'sInside the Mind of Gideon Rayburn. But this time, instead of seeing and hearing everything that her boyfriend has to say, Molly finds herself alternately in the mind of super beautiful Pilar Binitez-Jones -- a girl whom Gideon (and every other boy at school) has a crush on. This leads to some majorly soul-crushing moments, like at an academic competition when Pilar thinks about Gideon: ""If we win tonight... I will sleep with him, and I will totally try to stay with him too."" But eventually, though her ESP, Molly is able to make some smart insights about the insecurities everyone has deep inside -- and how to be happy anyway.
","Readers shouldn't expect to really be challenged here, but as far as fun, fluffy, prep school books are concerned, this one is pretty well done. The cast of characters may be somewhat predictable -- Molly is smart but insecure, Gideon is sweet and clueless, while pretty Pilar's perfection comes at a price -- but the ESP angle is a fun device and leads to some hilarious moments (such as when Molly calls the Fred Segal store to warn them that Pilar has been trying on bathing suits without her underwear). The sweet underlying message about being true to yourself (instead of trying to be exactly what your boyfriend wants) will even leave readers feeling good about devouring this literary junk food.","Parents need to know that this book features all kinds of racy material, from the main character planning to have sex with her boyfriend in the school's chapel to a scene where an underage girl makes out with a creepy dean as part of an elaborate scheme. There is swearing, drug use, and sex among the teens at Midvale Prep -- and the prettiest girl at school  pretty much starves herself in an effort to look thinner.

"This Savage Song: Monsters of Verity, Book 1",Complex fantasy expertly explores good and evil.,"In THIS SAVAGE SONG, when Kate Harker decides to burn down the chapel at her boarding school, she finally gets her wish to return to the divided city over which her ruthless father rules one side. When she transfers to a new school in Verity, she meets August, who looks human but is actually a monster working undercover for his family. The Harkers and the Flynns must abide by the shaky truce that governs the city, and there are forces that wish to tear the peace asunder. Kate and August must call upon their better selves to spare the lives of thousands of innocents, if only they can trust each other.
","Rich in character, original in its world-building, and unpredictable in its plotting, this offbeat urban fantasy finds nuance in the battle between good and evil. This Savage Song focuses on two characters who believe themselves to be villains and eventually see the good parts of themselves. Author Victoria Schwab keeps the narrative pressure on August and Kate as they attempt to protect each other against a deadly conspiracy, and their intense interplay makes this novel stand out. Schwab excels at this kind of immersive saga, and this volume's cliffhanger ending will leave her fans eager for more.","Parents need to know that This Savage Song: Monsters of Verity, Book 1 is the first half of an action-packed urban fantasy by Victoria Schwab. It features main characters who struggle against their respective dark sides. The language is occasionally rough: a half dozen uses of ""s--t"" and its variants; one or two uses of ""f--k,"" and a handful of ""damn"" and ""hell."" Some violent scenes feature stabbings, gunfights, and magic. Characters actively or passively participate in the deaths of their family members. There's a spark between August and Kate, but there is little time to pursue romance in this installment.

We're Going to Be Friends,"Retro art, collage bring fond school-day lyrics to life.","WE'RE GOING TO BE FRIENDS takes Jack White's song lyrics bout the childhood pleasures of school, play, and friendship and sets them amid black-and-white photos, retro illustrations of a boy and a girl, and fantasy drawings of animals, birds, and bugs to create a simple story of a day at school. A young boy meets Suzy Lee and asks her to ""walk with me,"" then they head to school ""all by ourselves,"" sit ""side by side"" in class, and eventually walk home together, hand in hand, looking forward to more shared fun the next day: ""when I wake tomorrow I'll bet / that you and I will walk together again.""
","This offbeat and upbeat story of a day at school and making a new friend offers a cheery, nostalgic view of free-range childhood and a fun day in the classroom and at recess. We're Going to Be Friends is simple enough for kindergartners but should also please grown-ups who recall a more carefree time -- and for fans of the White Stripes who know the song the book is based on.

Percy Jackson's Greek Gods,Huge gift book of Percy-narrated Greek myths is tons of fun.,"After exploring how the Greeks thought the world began in a chapter entitled ""The Beginning and Stuff,"" the Titans appear, followed by the Olympians, who rage a battle royale for dominance. Then each of the 12 major Greek gods gets his or her own chapter. Percy refuses to start with Zeus, claiming he has a big enough ego already, so he goes with the order in which the gods were born. Each chapter includes full-color illustrations and Percy's take on each god's origins, what they're most known for, and stories of them interacting with mortals, looking for love, and smiting those who wronged them.
","PERCY JACKSON'S GREEK GODS is thorough, easy to read, and high on entertainment value. Readers get to enjoy Percy's sardonic and somewhat goofy voice, and, as with all Percy books, the humor in the chapter titles alone draws you in. ""Hermes Goes to Juvie"" and ""Ares, the Manly Man's Manly Man"" are two greats. The illustrations by John Rocco also are fabulous, especially the full-page ones in the gift-book size. This is not a book you get on iTunes or in paperback; spring for the hardcover. ","Parents need to know Percy Jackson's Greek Gods is a hefty gift-size volume that profiles the 12 major Greek gods, as narrated by Percy Jackson from the bestselling series. It helps a little to read the Percy Jackson books first. Then readers will instantly connect with the narrator. They'll know why Percy prefers some gods over others and will get his sometimes sardonic, sometimes goofy sense of humor. Percy's wit helps smooth things over when the content gets more mature. Gods can behave very badly; they swallow their own children (who pop out eventually as fully formed gods), tear mortals and other gods apart (such as when Zeus gets his tendons ripped out), torture those who wrong them with outrageous eternal punishments (for starters, poor Prometheus is chained to a rock while an eagle pecks at his liver every day), get mortals to go crazy and kill their own families, and stalk mortals they want to romance (there's one mention of a sexual assault). They also cheat on their godly spouses a lot. Percy covers their exploits with phrases such as ""get cuddly with"" and ""extremely naughty."" With the chapter on Bacchus, the wine god, comes a humorous disclaimer about how kids should wait until they're 40 before they drink -- they won't like the hangovers. Besides providing a thorough study of the Greek myths, there are plenty of educational tidbits sprinkled throughout about word origins, why ancient Greeks and Romans wore laurel wreaths on their heads, and much more.

Seventeenth-century English teens Christopher, Tom, and Sally nd the brave pigeon Bridget, tasked by Charles II himself, are soon on their way to the court of Louis XIV to find out. It all seems to have something to do with the Knights Templar. And a famous painting. Also a poem written in cipher. Our heroes face many dire perils en route to a conclusion that suggests their troubles are just beginning.
","Author Kevin Sands delivers another harrowing, hilarious, heartrending page-turner set in the 17th century, this time with his teen protagonists sent to spy on the court of Louis XIV. The Assassin's Curse delivers a bit about deciphering codes, the history of the Knights Templar, and just the right chemicals for dissolving gold. There's lots of historic detail, suspenseful intrigue, and opportunity to cheer the appealing heroes -- who need all the help they can get.","Parents need to know that Kevin Sands' The Assassin's Curse, the latest installment in the Blackthorn Key series, is packed with history, science, French, Latin, and other interesting bits of knowledge.

"The Alphabet from A to Y, with Bonus Letter Z",Wild and crazy alphabet humor best for older kids.,"The scene on each left-hand page is filled with cleverly drawn pictures of words starting with the letter given. Each letter is shown in large print, and then exemplified in a goofy alliterative couplet on the right-hand page.
","Alphabet books are fun, but most are written for younger readers; this one is more on the unique and zany side than most, and its humor is definitely pointed toward an older audience. This creates a weird situation: While readers of any age might enjoy the book on some level, and parents will not tire of reading it to their children, most young readers will miss many of the clever jokes in both the drawings and the text. And some references are clearly inappropriate for more impressionable kids. Still, older kids -- who are the more appropriate audience -- may not be interested in a book about sounds and letters ... at least at first glance.
The cover, with its small details and intriguing title, is captivating. The inner covers are full of letter-based symbols chatting in cartoon fashion about their special skills and talents. And, from that point on, the silliness just grows! Letters from A to Y, and including the bonus z, are presented in unusual and playful illustrations that are sure to entertain all ages. The alliterative couplets that play on presented sounds are weird and crazy, and Steve Martin fans will hear his voice in the writing. From ""Amiable Amy, Alice, and Andie"" and ""Bad Baby Bubbleducks"" to ""Yuri the yeti"" and ""Zany Zeno,"" the names of the characters as well as their scenarios reverberate with his off-the-wall humor. The illustrations drawn by Roz Chast are just as imaginative, and readers familiar with The New Yorker magazine will recognize the jittery lines of her intricately comic drawings. Here they fit perfectly with Martin's tone and make this a book well worth checking out.","Parents need to know that, though this is a very entertaining, clever, funny alphabet book, it really may not be appropriate for younger kids. Most little kids will not get much of the humor, and the joking references to alcohol and poop as well as name-calling are meant more for older readers. Also, phonics fanatics may be irritated by the mix of hard and soft sounds on the letter pages. However, older readers, including adults, will find this whole approach to the alphabet unique and very entertaining.

"Eragon: The Inheritance Cycle, Book 1",A teen wrote this engrossing fantasy story.,"Soon after the strange stone he found in the forest hatches a dragon, Eragon finds that his life has changed forever; his home is destroyed, the uncle who raised him is killed, and he and the dragon, Saphira, are forced to flee the minions of Galbatorix's evil Empire. Accompanied by Brom the storyteller, Eragon discovers that he is the last of the Riders, who once kept the peace and were wiped out by Galbatorix.
While pursuing revenge against those who killed his uncle, Eragon learns to communicate telepathically with Saphira, and Brom begins teaching him the skills of fighting and magic. But soon Eragon realizes he is a pawn in a vast power struggle that is tearing the Empire apart, and that he and his dragon may be the ones to change the balance of power -- if only they can find out whom to trust.
Includes map, pronunciation guide, and language glossary.
","That young first-time author Christopher Paolini is a major talent in the making seems certain -- but he's not quite there yet. Paolini (he was 15 when he wrote this book) has gotten quite a bit of publicity for ERAGON, the first of a planned trilogy called Inheritance, and it's easy to see why. The story is large in size (around 500 pages), epic in scope, and very engrossing. For a generation of young fantasy fans who love long, monumental, high fantasy, a teen author is icing on the cake.
It's not long, however, before they begin to notice the long-winded descriptions, the clichés and hackneyed dialogue, and the derivative nature of the plot -- straight out of Star Wars by way of The Lord of the Rings, with bits of other great fantasies thrown in here and there. That this is a great achievement for one so young is undeniable, and many children will love it. It certainly ranks right up there with other overblown fantasies written by adults, such as Terry Brooks's Sword of Shannara series.","Parents need to know that the idea that a teen wrote this will be fascinating to many children, and it may inspire some to try their own hand at writing.

Draw!,Wildly imaginative wordless book celebrates art and drawing.,"A young boy confined to bed with a temporary illness (a bottle of medicine and an inhaler are pictured at his bedside) is reading a book about Africa. He starts a series of drawings in which he's hiking across a savannah, easel in tow. But, when we turn the page, he's in Africa, setting up the easel to sketch an actual elephant. He works on some studies of zebras and stampeding giraffes and then perches in a tree to sketch a pride of lions. A charging rhino provides a dramatic, full-spread chase scene, and there are monkeyshines with gorillas and baboons: The gorilla nabs his sandwich, and the baboons take the easel and draw the boy. After a tender and touching good-bye to the elephant, another series of pictures records the boy's journey out of the plains and back to bed, where the telltale pages of African artwork are now strewn across the floor. On the last page, the boy is at school, proudly sharing his animal portraits with his class.
","This book has a wonderfully positive message: A young boy is so inspired by the book he's reading that he takes himself on an African safari just by drawing the animals in the book. The depth is in the details. Though the book is wordless, there's a story with a clear dramatic arc, and kids can inspect the art closely to ""read"" it. The page that shows his tender parting good-bye to the elephant speaks volumes.
Draw! lso contributes to our canon of diverse children's books. In an author's note, Colón describes his childhood interest in art growing up in New York City and Puerto Rico, and the protagonist looks as if he could be Colón as a young boy. But all children can identify with this imaginative and adventurous young artist and take its directive -- draw! -- to heart.","Parents need to know that Draw! is a wordless picture book by noted illustrator Raúl Colón (Baseball Is…) that celebrates art and is itself wildly artful.

Though Draw! is wordless, there's a clear story line and a dramatic arc that readers can discover through a close reading of the pictures. The implicit message is that art is fun and exciting. And, though all readers will be able to identify with this appealing protagonist, he appears to be a portrait of the artist as a young boy, which means that Colón has added a welcome new Latino character to our shelves.

Then Flat Petey takes a witch doctor's ""living spray"" and ""obey spray"" and gets into mischief of his own. It's up to Dog Man, of course, to save the day.
","The second book in Dav Pilkey's freewheeling series about a half-man, half-dog police officer remains true to form: It's ridiculous, pure fun for reluctant readers and comic book fans alike. The plot in Dog Man Unleashed is more sprawling than the one in the first book, which presented Dog Man's origin story and a few short stories.
The appeal of Dog Man lies in his undeniable canine tendencies: He's always distracted by a ball, he licks bones, and his coworkers rev him up for an assignment the way you'd talk to a dog about to go for a walk. Pilkey -- best known for his Captain Underpants series, a kid favorite often criticized by grown-ups -- cheerfully ends the book by celebrating the ""mindless action"" and lack of life lessons. Kids will enjoy the silly puns (which/witch doctor, tax/tacks) and goofy plot devices.

Still, he must eventually return to his own kind, the elephants, who give him the highest tribute when they see the results of his hard effort.

First published in 1933, this book has become a classic beloved by generations of parents and children. Its long staying power attests to its value, and yet, in retrospect, one suspects it would not be published if it were offered to editors today.

"The Tale of Despereaux: Being the Story of a Mouse, a Princess, Some Soup, and a Spool of Thread",Brave mouse adventure a modern classic; great read-aloud.,"Listen, dear reader, to Kate DiCamillo, and you will hear of Despereaux Tilling, a half-sized mouse with giant ears who is ""such the disappointment"" to his mama because he won't act like other mice. He is sickly, faints at loud noises, loves music, bright light, and reading books. Worst of all, because he has fallen in love with a human princess named Pea, he talks to humans. For this transgression he is condemned by the other mice, including his own father, to be sent to the dungeon to be eaten by the rats. You will also, dear reader, hear of Roscuro the rat, who also loves light, but has a grudge against the princess. And of Miggery Sow, an abused, dimwitted, partially deaf serving girl who wishes to be a princess. And you will hear how the strange stories of these three outsiders intersect in a most unusual way. Reader, do you believe in happily ever after?
","Kate DiCamillo can do charming. Her debut novel, ""Because of Winn-Dixie,"" was simple and enchanting. Despereaux's tale is more complex and stylized: The author directly addresses the reader throughout, and the hero disappears for nearly a hundred pages. But it has charm in buckets, perfectly matched by Timothy Ering's delightfully weird illustrations.
THE TALE OF DESPEREAUX hits the trifecta for a children's book: It makes a great read-alone, read-aloud, or reading group book. It's easy to read, despite its length and sometimes advanced vocabulary, and perfectly paced and plotted to hold a middle-grade reader's interest. The direct address makes it perfect for involving listeners in the reading. And that same way of talking to the reader allows the author to raise questions that would make for interesting literature group discussions.","Parents need to know that Kate DiCamillo's Newbery Medal-wining​ The Tale of Despereaux is a thrilling story of a brave, giant-eared mouse in love with a human princess. By by directly addressing the reader, the author introduces many concepts to think and talk about. This book is an excellent read-aloud or discussion group book. It could be read to children as young as 6, but parents need to know there is some violence -- Despereaux's tail is cut off, and a girl's ears are boxed until she's partially deaf.

Broken,Suspenseful medical drama about girl yearning to fit in.,"Fifteen-year-old Scarlet has spent her life in and out of hospitals after being diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder that affects her heart rhythm. Entirely homeschooled in the past, she's finally allowed to attend public high school as BROKEN opens. Scarlet wants nothing more than to be a ""normal"" teen but struggles to fit in after she's quickly branded a ""freak."" When research for a biology project starts to raise questions about her past, she'll have an even tougher struggle to learn the truth about her family and her illness.
","In Broken, author CJ Lyons effectively uses the backdrop of a serious medical condition to highlight common teen issues. Fitting in and being perceived as ""normal,"" wanting to become independent, needing supportive friends, standing up for yourself, nd wondering if you'll ever find true love -- all of these are explored.
The suspense builds nicely to an exciting finish, but a lot of the dialogue between the high school kids doesn't ring true. Scarlet's inconsistent, contradictory observations may be realistic for a 15-year-old, but the flat narration and romance-novel dialogue detract from the character's credibility. Young readers may not notice, though, and shouldn't have a problem identifying with and rooting for Scarlet as she strives for a normal life.","Parents need to know that Broken, prolific writer CJ Lyons' YA debut, is a teen medical drama with frequent but not gory mentions of blood and other anatomical subjects. Episodes of violent and sexual bullying punctuate the story. Infrequent strong language includes ""s--t,"" ""ass,"" ""bitch,"" and ""hell."" There are several incidents of sexual harassment, including leering, and two brief kisses. Sporadic drug references include one mixture that induces heart attacks. As the story develops, protagonist Scarlet discovers dark secrets involving her family, including a mysterious death.

Seven Wonders Book 2: Lost in Babylon,Time-travel adventure excites but lacks solid characters.,"Jack, Aly, Cass, and Marco, gifted descendants of the original inhabitants of Atlantis and carriers of a rare genetic defect, are running out of time to save themselves. The treatments from the scientists at the secretive Karai Institute help keep them alive, but they must keep finding special power sources called the Loculi hidden at the seven Ancient Wonders of the World for the ultimate cure. After a narrow escape from a reincarnated Colossus of Rhodes in Book 1, they're headed for the fertile crescent -- Iraq -- the original site of the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. Thanks to a strange underwater time warp, the foursome can visit more than the ruins. They don tunics and sandals and -- splash! -- they're at the court of the Babylonian king. Too bad he's not offering guided tours of the Hanging Gardens anymore; no one's allowed in. After much sneaking around and some serious bargaining to get in the king's good graces -- sure, Marco can kill that huge, scary monster for you! -- they think they're getting closer to their goal. But then come the booby traps, and the crazy spitting birds that burn, and Kranag, the blind and incredibly lethal shapeshifter. Once again, the four face a nearly impossible task, and time on both sides of the warp is running out.
","Just like Book 1, LOST IN BABYLON has all the bait that fantasy-adventure fans need to dive right in. It will entertain, sure -- and lure you to the next book with a great cliffhanger -- but it won't stick with you like a Rick Riordan mythology-tinged adventure.
	Peter Lerangis' characters still need more to them. Readers may find themselves rooting more for Daria, a cool new Babylonian girl, than for the foursome at the center of the story -- not good. And again, adults who want something from the teens are barely described, and this is what's supposed to make all of them untrustworthy. Hmm... Without solid characters to build your story on, this tower will fall.","Parents need to know that Peter Lerangis' Lost in Babylon is the second book in the Seven Wonders series, which sets four 13-year-olds on adventures to find seven sources of power, each hidden in one of the Ancient Wonders of the World. In this series installment, they visit the Hanging Gardens of Babylon as they were in antiquity (through a clever time warp) and the great pyramids in Egypt as they are today. Violence continues to be about average for the fantasy-adventure genre. The teens get some bloody injuries and burns from fantasy creatures, are kidnapped, and fight against enemies with spears, dart guns and modern guns, and throwing knives. It gets a little gruesome when a man is speared and picked apart by birds and another is stoned and thrown to the crocodiles (neither event is described in detail). The same talented kids are brave and resourceful and work well together to survive but also encounter a major betrayal. All of them need special treatments to stay alive, thanks to the genetic defect that marks them as both gifted and as descendants of Atlantis.

"Mastiff: Beka Cooper, Book 3",Uneven finish to exciting but violent crime/fantasy trilogy.,"MASTIFF picks up approximately three years after the events of Bloodhound; in that time, Lower City Provost's Dog Beka Cooper has apparently acquired -- and lost -- a fiance, fellow Dog Holborn, whose death she's mourning as the book opens. Well, less mourning than regretting, really -- turns out she had been planning to break up with him, and the avalanche of sympathy she's now facing is leaving her quite uncomfortable. So when Lord Provost Gershom recruits Beka; her scent hound, Achoo; and her human partner, Tunstall, to lead a top-secret Hunt, she's relieved to have a distraction. Then she finds out that they'll be hunting for 4-year-old Prince Gareth, who has been kidnapped by ruthless, murderous slavers. As the trio and their companions -- including deceptively rascally mage Master Farmer, powerful Lady Sabine, and inscrutable Pounce the cat -- follow the prince's trail, they realize that there's even more afoot than they knew ... and that rescuing the prince could mean rescuing the realm as well.
","There's no question that Mastiff brings Beka's story to an exciting and mostly satisfying conclusion, but the book has more rough spots than most of Pierce's other novels. The abrupt introduction of a dead fiance whom readers never got a chance to meet feels awkward and makes it difficult to jump right into the story; the whole situation frankly seems out of character for Beka and unnecessary to the larger story.
 Other smaller scenes/moments/incomplete explanations pop up along the way that are just jarring enough to distract readers from what's otherwise a tense crime procedural with some interesting twists and turns, and that's too bad. The book also seems a bit overlong (usually not an issue at all with Pierce's work), but the introduction of Master Farmer is a welcome one (he's sort of the Han Solo of Provost's mages), and Beka remains -- as always -- a heroine you're happy to root for. One note for readers who may not be familiar with Pierce's other work: This series serves as a distant prequel to the Alanna books, so you might want to check those out next if you haven't already.","Parents need to know that the conclusion to Tamora Pierce's Beka Cooper fantasy/crime trilogy is even more violent than the previous books in the series. Slaves, including young children, are abused and brutally killed; there are many other deaths and injuries, plus torture, fights (with batons, swords, fists, etc.), arson, and more. The story revolves around a kidnapping, and the main characters are in near-constant peril. Sexuality is less of a theme/issue here than in the previous book in the series, but sex and sexual orientation are still treated matter-of-factly and casually -- though never graphically. Through it all, Beka remains a strong female character who prizes loyalty, duty, and hard work above everything and always stays true to herself.

Love,"Gorgeous book about love shows family worry and pain, too.","LOVE begins with ""two wide-eyed figures standing near the foot of your bed, and the sound of their voices is love."" It moves on to other simple examples of love, for instance, a cabdriver who ""plays love softly on his radio while you bounce in back with the bumps of the city,"" and ""a slice of burned toast that tastes like love"" offered by a brother. It ends by reassuring kids that when the time comes for them to set off on their own, they'll leave armed with love. While the book hints that life can be laced with worry and pain, it highlights examples of love.  ","This book about love, featuring folks of different races, offers gentle instruction in how to look for love in all the right places by noticing it coursing through everyday life. In Love, families and neighbors connect and have fun and support one another in simple yet deeply meaningful ways. Author Matt de la Peña and illustrator Loren Long collaborate to present examples that are sweetly touching. A dad catches a bus at dawn for work, while an older brother offers his little brother a simple breakfast. A boy in a wheelchair offers a hot dog from a street vender to a homeless man on a park bench. Four uncles toss horseshoes in the shade of backyard palms. A schoolgirl drops a dollar in the guitar case of ""a man in rags outside the subway station"" who's playing ""love notes that lift into the sky like tiny beacons of light.""
The gorgeous illustrations are full of tender detail. In one particularly affecting spread, the text says, ""the face staring back in the bathroom mirror -- this, too is love,"" as we stare into a young girl's soulful eyes. Long and de la Peña wisely don't shy away from acknowledging that life has its challenges, and for some kids, the challenges are serious. The few pages about strife might be confusing, presenting more questions than answers. What exactly's happening with that family gathered worriedly around a TV? ( Long and de la Peña have referred to this as the ""9/11 page,"" where a mother tries to block something horrific on the screen to protect a toddler from seeing it.) Or the one where a boy is cowering under the piano while a man stumbles away from a whiskey glass? (De la Peña has said there was addiction and divorce in his family.) Families can talk about those scenes as they otherwise get lost in the lovely, lyrical text and art, and the larger message about love.","Parents need to know that Love, by Newbery Medal-winning Matt de la Peña (Last Stop on Market Street) and illustrated by Loren Long (Otis), highlights the ways love is expressed and the ways that love shows itself simply and unexpectedly in everyday life. The illustrations feature warm, loving families of different races, most in humble circumstances. These families live in trailers by the sea or run through summer sprinklers in urban playgrounds, and their strong examples deliver the book's message: We can look for and notice real human connection and love. Most spreads are warm and reassuring, but a couple tackle more complex issues (a child affected by parental substance abuse, protecting kids from disturbing images on TV).

Unhooking the Moon,Fast-paced adventure of orphan siblings on quest in NYC.,"When their father dies at the beginning of UNHOOKING THE MOON, siblings Bob and Marie Claire (aka the Rat) decide to journey on their own from Winnipeg, Canada, to New York City in search of their dad's estranged brother. Besides a penchant for crazy schemes and an addiction to mochas, 10-year-old Rat has a talent for befriending colorful characters, including a cigar smuggler, a street hustler, and a famous rapper, all of whom try to help her. As Bob and the Rat search the New York boroughs for their uncle (who's rumored to be the city's biggest drug dealer), they encounter many dangers, but the Rat always manages to extract them. When a corrupt children's home takes the Rat, it's up to Bob to unite her unusual group of friends and rescue her.
","Although this fast-paced story isn't meant to be realistic, the idea of two modern-day kids looking for someone and not first consulting the Internet is hard to swallow. Rat's endless wacky capers and her way of assessing people as either angels or pedophiles will charm some readers, but others will find her almost magical ability to slip in and out of crazy situations too unbelievable and ultimately tiresome. Big brother Bob's readiness to believe her premonitions and follow her into situations he doesn't understand is often baffling. Still, the story's varied action and its cast of unusual characters will appeal to many readers.","Parents need to know that Unhooking the Moon is about two Canadian kids on their own in New York City, in search of an uncle they've never met. The kids hop a freight train, take rides from strangers, lie to authorities, hustle people for money, and camp out in Central Park, among other inadvisable activities. They have several narrow escapes from danger, including encounters with pedophiles. The book's tall-tale flavor and the Rat's mystical premonitions and prophetic dreams let readers recognize Unhooking the Moon as an adventure story that, though grounded in the real world, isn't necessarily supposed to be realistic. However, the ending may disturb those who expect the story to be ultimately lighthearted.

Is it time for them to go their separate ways, or can this lifelong friendship be saved?
","This colorful, engaging, and lively debut graphic novel has girl power galore. Big kids and tweens will easily relate to Astrid as she learns how to navigate a world where everything -- especially feelings and friendships -- is getting so much more complicated. And they'll really root for Astrid as she struggles to get good enough to be the team's jammer at the big bout. Astrid really is worth admiring as she powers through the bumps and bruises and picks herself up after each of the (seemingly millions) of times she falls down.
Author Victoria Jamieson's background in design and illustration serves her well in creating a vivid, entertaining, but realistic world. The engaging characters are well realized in pictures and with words, and the illustrations effectively enhance the text by adding nuance and telling detail to the story. Big kids and tweens will find a lot to admire here.","Parents need to know that  Victoria Jamieson's 2016 Newbery Honor book, Roller Girl, is a graphic novel about how things change for Astrid during the summer between fifth and sixth grades. Against the backdrop of a roller-derby day camp, the book explores themes of friendship, working hard for something you really want, being a team player, and being ready for how much more complicated life becomes as you grow up. Violence is all on the rink, with elbow and hip checks shown. Sportsmanship, fair play, and being a contributing part of a team are all emphasized. Boy-girl dynamics are briefly touched on when Astrid wonders if  boy and girl she sees are on a date and whether they'll kiss. Astrid's a great model for sticking with something when it's hard nd for learning how to be a better friend. All adults are great role models. There's some name-calling; the strongest language is a few mentions of Astrid's nickname at school, ""Ass-turd.""

Louisiana's Way Home,"Harrowing, heartfelt, funny tale of '70s Southern tween.","LOUISIANA'S WAY HOME begins in the fall of 1977 as 12-year-old Louisiana Elefante, last seen in Raymie Nightingale, is forced from her Florida home on a road trip to parts unknown at 3 a.m. by her crazy granny, with no word to anyone. Before long Granny's laid low by a dental emergency, 12-year-old Louisiana drives the car off the road, and they're stranded in a small town in Georgia after defrauding a dentist and conning their way into a motel room. Which turns out to be just the beginning of Louisiana's troubles nd, she figures, only her due, considering the family curse. But when she meets Burke, a kid her own age, and Clarence, his pet crow, and other unexpectedly kind people, she hopes for some help getting back home to Lister, Florida, and her friends.
","Kate DiCamillo spins a harrowing tale of abandonment and family curses in a Southern small town in the '70s -- offset by determination, music, joy, kind strangers, and an irresistible kid narrator. Louisiana's Way Home features lots of great characters, humor, and heart. Young Louisiana's long-suffering outrage at being uprooted from home and friends (by a crazy adult) will resonate with many readers, who will find lots to cheer as she stands up to overwhelming circumstances. Here, after much struggle to find a phone, she's just failed to get the directory assistance operator to find the number of her friend back home:
""'Honey,' said the operator, 'it will all be fine.'
""And then there was a click and she was gone.
""I hung up the phone. I bent over and put my hands on my knees and worked to get air into my lungs.
""I thought, it will not all be fine.
""I thought, I am alone in the world, and I will have to find some way to rescue myself.""","Parents need to know that Louisiana's Way Home, by Kate DiCamillo, involves characters from Raymie Nightingale and begins two years after that book's conclusion. As in the first book, also set in the South during the 1970s, some really terrible things happen, starting with the 12-year-old narrator being yanked from her bed by her crazy scamming grandma in the middle of the night and hitting the road for parts unknown, with no word to her friends. There's a whole lot of traumatic abandonment in the story itself and in the past, where a magician's ditching his family has far-reaching consequences. Louisiana's grandmother has been conning, lying, and stealing to survive as long as anyone's known her, and involves Louisiana in her schemes. Kids are fond of stealing from vending machines, and some people are just plain mean and rotten. But coming out of all that, with many shining moments of low-key but life-changing kindness, is a strong sense of friendship, family, belonging, and determination, all seen through the eyes of a young girl you're rooting for from the first outrageous moment.

"Mac Undercover: Mac B., Kid Spy, Book 1",Rollicking spy adventure is loaded with humor.,"MAC UNDERCOVER: MAC B., KID SPY, BOOK 1 tells the ""true"" story of author Mac Barnett, who claims that, as a kid growing up in California, he got a call from the Queen enlisting his help recovering some stolen Crown Jewels. When Mac flies to London to investigate, he follows the trail of the missing Coronation Spoon to Paris, where he gets caught up in another theft at the Louvre Museum. The plot thickens when he ends up in Moscow, negotiating with a slippery KGB agent. Will Mac recover the jeweled spoon and the famous art as well? And what could the thief possibly want in return?
","You don't get much more kid friendly than this rollicking, illustrated spy adventure. Mac Undercover: Mac B., Kid Spy, Book 1 is pure fun to read, as the dry-witted kid narrator is whisked off to England, France, Russia, and home again, all in service to the Queen of England. Author Mac Barnett has a reputation as a sly and witty prankster, and kids will love his insistence that this fantastic story ""actually happened to me."" A Top Secret note opens the book, claiming, ""I was a spy for the Queen of England when I was a kid. It was a different time. 1989, to be exact.""
The jokes are equally divided between the text, with its fast-paced silliness, and cartoon-like illustrations by Mike Lowery. There's art on most pages, and it delivers some of the punch lines; for instance, throwing shade on British cookies by labeling a dry-looking biscuit both ""Dog Biscuit (USA)"" and ""Biscuit (England)."" Seamlessly woven into the fun is some solid nonfiction content -- including historical notes about the countries Mac visits.","Parents need to know that Mac Undercover: Mac B., Kid Spy, Book 1 is a very funny chapter book, the first in a new series by Mac Barnett, and illustrated by Mike Lowery. Barnett is known as an advocate for getting boys more interested in reading nd is acclaimed for his many popular picture books, including Sam & Dave Dig a Hole and Extra Yarn, which won Caldecott Honors. Here he injects his trademark humor into a book for older readers, starting with the claim that this wild, outlandish spy story is an actual memoir of his youth. Enlisted by the Queen of England to recover some stolen Crown Jewels, young Mac travels to London, Paris, and Moscow in a journey studded with dry humor and historical tidbits.

Over and Under the Pond,Lovely book about wildlife teeming in and around a pond.,"In OVER AND UNDER THE POND, a boy and his mom paddle over a pond in a canoe. When the boy asks, ""What’s down there?"" the text describes the life that's both over and above the pond. For instance, under the pond beavers dive for ""delectable roots,"" and dragonflies ""catch minnows in their monster-fast jaws."" Above the pond, a red-winged blackbird collects grasses for her nest. As ""the sky turns from sunset to dusk to dark,"" the two head home, while ""Night settles over the pond … and the hidden world under the pond.""
","A book that's as deep and bountiful as the pond it plumbs, this profile of a rich, busy ecosystem will entrance all nature lovers. In Over and Under the Pond, author Kate Messner's text is clear and informative as well as lyrical, with passages such as ""The water’s a mirror, reflecting the sky,"" and a description of dragonfly larvae catching minnows ""in monster-fast jaws.""
Illustrator Christopher Silas Neal's art makes the pond come alive, revealing what cannot easily be seen below the surface. In one spread with a striking perspective, we look down at the pond from the great height of a woodpecker pecking a tall tree. In another, we look up from the depths at the bottom of the boat. Neal cast the boy and the mom as African-American, and it's our pleasure to take a ride with this thoughtful, observant pair, as our attention is drawn to all the wildlife around them.","Parents need to know that Over and Under the Pond, by Kate Messner, illustrated by Christopher Silas Neal, is the third in their series of books observing the plants and animals around us. The previous two are set in the snow and the garden (Up in the Garden and Down in the Dirt). In this book, an African-American boy and mom are skimming over a pond in a canoe, observing the rich wildlife teeming above and below the water's surface. The text demonstrates how the animals they spot are interconnected, and at the end provides additional information about each animal featured. The boy's a sensitive and perceptive role model, and by example encourages kids to be mindful of the environment. This book's a natural for budding naturalists.

Where I Live,"Uplifting story of fearless, homeless teen in high school.","No one at Hinderwood High knows that Linden Rose has a dark past or a big secret. She's homeless, living in the halls and dugout of her small-town high school, and she's good at keeping this on the down low, even from her best friends, Ham (who's gay) and Seung (who's mixed-race Korean and white). No one in the newsroom where Linden is the school's blog editor knows what she's hiding. Her goal is to graduate and go to college, which is why she's working two jobs and doing everything she can to keep her grades up. The basics are a struggle: taking a shower, not falling asleep in class, and keeping the contents of her backpack a secret. When Linden discovers that a classmate's boyfriend is abusing her, she worries for her but also knows what it's like to desperately hold on to a secret.
","This heartbreaking but ultimately uplifting debut novel captures the depth and ripple effects of homelessness. The subject matter is heavy but important, especially because there are so few mainstream stories about homeless teens. That said, the subplots here -- such as a classmate whose boyfriend hits her and a friend who's coming out -- are often disjointed, making the narrative arc quite challenging to follow.","Parents need to know that Brenda Rufener's Where I Live is an intense look at the life of a teen who's homeless and desperately trying to move on from her painful past. Physical abuse occurs in a teen relationship. There are also scenes depicting bullying and racism, such as when Toby tells Seung ""he should move back to his homeland"" and ""Go back to China and stay away from my girl!"" The violent passages aren't so graphic as to be hard for sensitive readers to get through. The book offers an honest look at how a young woman can end up without a home.

The Adventures of Odysseus,Smart picture-book version of the classic tale.,"Nine years after the end of the Trojan War, a stranger washes up on the island of Scheria. He is found by Princess Nausicaa and taken to her father Alcinous' palace. There they discover that he is Odysseus, king of Ithaca, and he begins to tell his tale.
After foolishly enraging the sea god Poseidon by blinding his son, the cylops Polyphemus, Odysseus and his men are blown from one hair-raising, deadly adventure to the next, until the ship is destroyed, all the men killed, and only Odysseus survives. But more trouble awaits him at home, where evil suitors have taken over his castle, insisting that Odysseus' wife choose one of them to marry.
","The authors of this version of The Odyssey tell the story in much the same order that Homer did, and they include a bit of gritty violence that hints at the gore of the original. The language is slightly formal, clear, and rich -- this is a retelling, not a dumbing-down.
The illustrations are less successful. Highly stylized, they wrap around the text in sometimes confusing ways, and no character, not even Odysseus (who is oddly portrayed beardless), ever becomes recognizable. They are the kind of pictures that don't draw kids in; kids will glance at them, occasionally puzzle over some of the more confusing ones, but they fail to linger in the mind or enhance the story. Nevertheless, for the text alone, this is a worthwhile addition to a child's library of classic stories.","Parents need to know that this is a bloody story, and the authors don't shy away from it. People are killed in battle and in cold blood, by humans and by monsters, and animals are killed for food and for sacrifice to the gods.

The Cadet of Tildor,Girl trains as elite soldier in sword-slashing fantasy.,"Having lost her mother and estranged from her father, Renee de Winter wants nothing more than to be an elite soldier-in-training at the Academy of Tildor. Her chances are jeopardized by the arrival of Korish Savoy, a hard-nosed commander reluctantly recalled from active duty, someone who seems unwilling to cut Renee the least bit of slack. The entire kingdom seethes with political turmoil, with two warring criminal families plotting to bring down the young, inexperienced Crown. Throw in some powerful and illegal magic, and Renee, Savoy and their compatriots are embroiled in conspiracy and warfare.
","THE CADET OF TILDOR sometimes feels as if it aspires to walk in the footsteps of George R.R. Martin's A Game of Thrones, minus the over-the-top sex and violence (and overwhelming page-count). Author Alex Lidell is not nearly as fluid or daring a writer as Martin, but who is on his or her first outing? The novel has plenty of straightforward action and adventure and features a resourceful female protagonist forced to make uncomfortable, often dangerous choices.The prose in The Cadet of Tildor might be occasionally awkward and the political machinations of the plot a tad murky, but the novel presents an interesting fantasy world populated by multidimensional characters.","Parents need to know that The Cadet of Tildor is a gritty, pseudo-medieval fantasy with sword fights that sometimes end in bloodshed and fatalities. There are also scenes of gladiatorial combat and a street encounter in which a gang-rape is narrowly averted. The language is sometimes salty, but characters mostly swear by ""the gods"" and the ""Seven Hells."" An illegal (and fictional) drug that controls magic is part of one subplot.

Ten-year-old Roberto Alvarez loved school. He, his siblings, and neighbors attended the Lemon Grove School along with the white children from nearby homes. The children studied and played together as equals. In the summer of 1930, the Lemon Grove School Board decided to segregate the Mexican American students. The board claimed these children had a ""language handicap"" and needed to be ""Americanized."" When the Mexican families learned of this plan, they refused to let their children enter the new, inferior school that had been erected closer to home. Instead, they formed a neighborhood committee and sought legal help. Roberto, a bright boy who spoke English well, was chosen to represent the community and became the plaintiff in a suit filed by the Mexican families. On March 12, 1931, the case of Roberto Alvarez v. the Board of Trustees of the Lemon Grove School District was decided. The judge ruled in favor of the children's right to equal education, ordering that Roberto and all the other Mexican American students be immediately reinstated in the Lemon Grove School. Schedule

","This powerful, poignant, and informative true story focuses on segregation in the 1930s nd a community of immigrants' hard-won fight for equal education. Todos Iguales / All Equal: Un Corrido de Lemon Grove / A Ballad of Lemon Grove can add to the current national discussion on immigration and the challenges faced not only by immigrants not only today but also decades ago. Hale's bilingual narrative, told separately in Spanish and English on each page, makes this an ideal text for readers of either language.

This picture book begins with a nine-verse ballad, or corrido,written by Hale. It tells the story of the Lemon Grove Incident and gives readers some background before they even begin reading the story. Notes at the back of the book explains ""Los corridos,""  bit of history, their use, and poetic structure. A history of Mexican Americans in the Lemon Grove area, along with a list of who's who in the court case, the results of the ruling, and an additional page of source notes about what happened after the ruling -- including other pivotal court rulings -- also appear at the back, along with a detailed list of sources. Here Hale also notes that illustrations for this book were inspired by vintage California citrus labels -- colorful, eye-catching labels attached to the ends of lemon crates that identified the brand, region, and product. Overall, Todos Iguales / All Equal is an informative nonfiction picture book that can serve as a great springboard for meaningful discussions about the immigrant experience, segregation, and the right to equal education.

The Big Book of Trains,Draws in railroad buffs and reluctant readers.,"In THE BIG BOOK OF TRAINS, huge photographs, a big-book format, and some of the most powerful or unusual trains will draw young railroad buffs -- and reluctant readers -- into the realm of the locomotive. There's a lot covered here: record-breaking engines, workhorse locomotives, and trains of the future; electric, diesel, and steam varieties; and a grab bag of facts and figures.
 ","What better way to convey in a book the majesty of a train than a huge 13-by-10-inch photo of one? Even readers who aren't train buffs will enjoy examining these pictures over and over again. The size of the photographs and the book itself are especially appropriate for kids 7 and younger, but older children are more likely to enjoy the text details.
The section on monorail trains mentions that most have only two cars, but one child immediately asked why that was true. Another wanted to know whether most steam trains ran on both steam and coal, or just coal, after the text pointed out that both configurations existed. But these are minor quibbles -- overall, this is a great book for curious kids.","Parents need to know that The Big Book of Trains has a great balance of need-to-know facts and astounding tidbits that will keep little kids and older readers -- including parents -- interested.

Through interwoven stories, readers get to know pregnant Mikayla, gay Shane, and Harley, who's trying on wild behavior like wearing tight clothes, drinking, and seeing a dangerous bad boy. There are some harsh plot points here: Shane falls in love with an HIV-infected boy and numbs his emotional pain with drugs and alcohol; Harley texts a naked picture of herself to her boyfriend, who sends it around, and he later rapes her while she's drunk. Through painful situations, these characters learn what they really need is time to grow up.

Unfortunately for Graham, one well-laid plan after another goes awry. As he scrambles to figure out other romantic gestures, he and his friends meet other kids, who further thwart his plans.

All the Rage,Powerful story about an isolated rape victim's struggles.,"In ALL THE RAGE, senior Romy Grey has spent a year as the social pariah of Grebe High School. After being date-raped by the local golden boy Kellan Turner (son of the small town's sheriff and its biggest CEO), she told people but was pressured not to file charges. Her accusation cost her everything, and a year later she's basically invisible except for the coat of blood-red lipstick and nail polish she wears every single day. The only bright spot in her life is her waitress job at a diner outside of town, the one place nobody knows about her past and where the handsome young cook looks at her with interest, not anger or disgust. Just as Romy begins to open herself up to the possibility of romance, a former friend goes missing, triggering Romy's thoughts about everything that's happened to her.
","Author Courtney Summers' unflinching look at the horror of not being believed after a rape is difficult to read. All the more so because Summers doesn't pander to readers by making Romy's violent encounter a run-in with a masked stranger. No, her attacker is the Big Man on Campus,  guy she openly liked and desired.
Romy's story arc doesn't come with pat solutions to the anxiety, isolation, and outright cruelty she has faced in the aftermath of accusing her rapist. Although she starts to fall for Leon, a 19-year-old graphic designer and part-time diner cook who does stop touching her when she asks him to, Romy struggles to overcome the shame she feels about her body. Terrible things happen to and around her; she isn't a senior with hopes of a good college and a vision for a sunny future. Nonetheless, Summers makes you ache for Romy's nearly perpetual sadness and cheer for her to find happiness and healing.","Parents need to know that Courtney Summers' All the Rage is a serious-issues book about a young woman who's a social outcast in her small town a year after accusing the sheriff's son of date rape. Mature teen readers (and adults) may find the heavy themes in the book difficult to process, but it's a powerful way to discuss rape and sexual abuse with teens who might otherwise think the issue doesn't affect them. There are disturbing scenes of sexual violence, self-harm, bullying, and cruelty. Very few people in the main character's life believe her, and she regularly suffers from harassment (both at the hands of other students and the town sheriff, father of the rapist). Language is frequently strong (""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""a--hole,"" ""bitch,"" ""whore,"" and so on), and there are a few kissing scenes and discussions of sex. Despite the intensely painful subject matter, All the Rage is a memorable addition to the list of young adult novels about sexual abuse.

But even there, there's no escape there, as Lucky becomes friends with a troubled older girl and continues to dream of his long-lost grandfather stuck in the jungles of Vietnam.
","Written with emotional insight and cynical, surrealistic humor, this is a compelling and unique portrait of a victim who learns to stand up for himself and take control of his own destiny. There are no easy answers, though. Although she drops elements of fantasy into the narrative, A.S.

The main character is physically and verbally abused by the high school bully, and one of his friends is punched in the eye by her mother. There are also violent dream images from the Vietnam War. However, the novel is a moving and well-constructed tale of learning to stand up for oneself, told with insight and humor. It will captivate young readers mature enough to grapple with the issues it raises.

Never Fall Down,Harrowing true story of boy in Cambodia's Killing Fields.,"Arn is a carefree 11-year-old kid, hustling money from the tourists with his younger brother and having good times in the city, when the Khmer Rouge take over his native Cambodia. Soon separated from his family, Arn learns to turn off the horrors around him and seize whatever opportunity he gets to survive -- the phrase \""never fall down\"" comes from his quick discovery that anyone who does meets a quick death. Early on, Arn finds a way to survive by playing propaganda songs for the soldiers and workers -- music, he later learns, that's being used to drown out the sounds of mass killing. NEVER FALL DOWN is based on the real experiences of human rights activist Arn Chorn Pond, who now works to restore traditional music in Cambodia.
","Never Fall Down is a powerful, compelling story whose subject matter is both horrific and inspiring, since the narrator survived and went on to have a good life and do good things. Still, it may be too intense for some readers, as it takes place in a world in which deadly violence is an almost casual occurrence.
Author Patricia McCormick elected to tell the story in the broken English of the child narrator, Arn, which is at once effective and somewhat distracting.","Parents need to know that while Never Fall Down is a novel, it documents a young boy's personal experience of -- and participation in -- one of the worst genocides in history. Patricia McCormick's fictional ""autobiography"" of Cambodian human rights activist Arn Chorn-Pond, who was 11 when the Khmer Rouge took over his country -- and proceeded to massacre about a fourth of its population between 1975 and 1979 -- is a powerful tale of the triumph of the human spirit. Separated from his family, Arn personally witnesses shootings, stabbings, ax blows to the head, and innumerable dead bodies. He also sees a starving 5-year-old gnawing on a dead body, until the child is taken off and killed. Arn is sexually abused (no detail is given), and girls are commonly raped (not shown). There's frequent use of ""s--t,"" in its literal sense, to describe starvation-induced diarrhea in the work and refugee camps.

Mae Among the Stars,Simple bio of first African-American female astronaut.,"In MAE AMONG THE STARS, young Mae has a dream. She wants to see Earth from space. Her mom tells her she'll have to become an astronaut, says anything's possible if she believes it and works hard for it, and takes her to the library for books about space and astronauts. Both parents continue to encourage her, even when her teacher tries to redirect her career choice by saying, ""Nursing would be a good profession for someone like you."" Still, her parents encourage her, and when Mae finally gets to space, she ""waved to her mom and dad on Earth.""
","A biography of an African-American woman who triumphed in a STEM field is always welcome, though this picture book about astronaut Dr. Mae Jemison could have had a bit more substance. Mae Among the Stars focuses on Jemison's childhood, when ""Little Mae was a dreamer"" and got the idea that she wanted to see Earth from space. Her mom takes her to the library where she ""searched for books about space and astronauts,"" and Mae makes an ""astronaut costume out of old orange curtains and cardboard boxes."" These details help bring young Mae alive for the reader. When she asks her dad, ""But how do I become an astronaut?"" he answers, ""If you can dream it, believe in it, and work hard for it, anything is possible."" This refrain, strong on emotional encouragement but light on specifics, is repeated throughout by her supportive parents.
The art by Stasia Burrington is cute and appealing, though somewhat generic, making this portrait of a smart, determined, science-minded girl and her supportive family best for the very young.","Parents need to know that Mae Among the Stars by Roda Ahmed, illustrated by Stasia Burrington, is a picture book biography of Dr. Mae Jemison, the first African-American female astronaut. Since the book is spare, without much concrete information about her life or her path, it's best for the youngest kids, who'll come away with the simple and clear message that when she was young, Dr. Jemison had a dream of what she wanted to do, and her parents encouraged her, even when peers scoffed and her teacher tried to redirect her. A very short afterword gives a bit more information about Jemison's impressive scholarship and accomplishments.

Anything But Typical,Realistic look inside the world of a tween with autism.,"Jason is an autistic 12-year-old who doesn't like loud noises, likes order and routine, but more important, he loves to write. His stories are a way to express himself to a world that often doesn't understand him. He submits his stories to an online website and finds a friend in another writer, a girl named Rebecca, who goes by the name Phoenix Bird. She likes his stories and accepts him, but when an opportunity comes for them to meet in person at a writing conference, Jason wonders if he'll lose his friend once she learns he's on the utism spectrum.
","Author Nora Baskin tries to bring readers into the world of a child oon the utism spectrum, and it's a heartbreaking, moving, and loving look. Jason struggles to use ""our language"" to describe the world around him and how he fits into it. He describes knowing how others feel about him even though they think he doesn't understand -- his mother taking his baby brother with her everywhere because she's afraid he might hurt him, his grandmother speaking slowly and loudly to him as if he can't hear, kids making fun of him, his anxiety about meeting a friend who doesn't know about his condition.
The words can sometimes come in a jumble, but the words are Jason's way of trying to connect his life to the lives of ""normal"" people. Some of the true gems of this book are Jason's stories that he posts online that parallel his life in ways he may not understand, but the readers will. Both kids and parents will love this wonderful, eye-opening, and sensitive story.
 ","Parents need to know that this book deals with a child on the utism spectrum and how he ffects others around him. There are some emotional situations, as well.

The Beauty of the Beast: Poems From the Animal Kingdom,One of the best collections of poetry ever.,"This stunning volume of poems about animals, accompanied by a profusion of tiny watercolor paintings, is one of the best collections ever. Both poems and art are intelligent yet simple and may inspire children to try some writing and painting of their own. Jack Prelutsky has selected more than 200 poems from over a hundred twentieth-century poets. All the poems are about animals, arranged by classification: insects, sea life, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Each section begins with a haiku by Prelutsky.
Some of the poets, such as Eve Merriam, Robert Frost, and Randall Jarrell, are familiar, while many others are less well known. All the poems are brief and accessible, though not necessarily created for children, and they run the gamut from whimsical and charming to thoughtful and poignant. The poems are surrounded by a profusion of simple watercolor paintings showing the creatures and impressions of their habitats. Includes title and author indexes.
","This marvelous collection is a boon to any teacher or parent wanting to introduce children to poetry. The poems and pictures are perfectly matched; both are lovely in their simplicity, and appeal to a wide range of ages and interests. The wealth of sounds, images, and ideas ensure that kids find something new and fascinating in repeated readings. This is a book not to be read through from beginning to end, but to be savored poem by poem.
Jack Prelutsky's wide reading and his respect for children are evident here; the selections are intelligent and perfect for children. There are no cutesy poems, none that condescend, and few chestnuts. A wealth of simple, impressionistic watercolors surround the poems. Children may be inspired to make their own watercolor pictures after looking at Meilo So's creations.","Parents need to know that this is one of the best poetry and art collections available for children.

The Ability,"Brilliant, thrilling story of kids training in mind control.","A mysterious secret operation involving telepathic kids goes badly awry, with one boy killed and a girl deserted by her companions and kidnapped by evil people. Thirty years later, in present-day London, 12-year-old Christopher Lane has been lying, stealing, and doing anything else he can to keep his family going, because his mother has been in a state of mental collapse since his soldier father was killed seven years earlier. His bleak life takes an unexpected turn when he's given an unusual test and suddenly whisked from his awful school to a top-secret government program where he and other kids with THE ABILITY get intensive mind-control training. Meanwhile, not far away, twin boys are getting the same training from their scary mom. How these plots converge, and what they reveal about the characters, make for a thrilling, touching, and thought-provoking read, whose ending leaves plenty of room for sequels.
","This is a brilliantly crafted tale. First-time author Monica Meira Vaughan, born to South American parents living in Spain who moved to London when she was 5, taught herself English by watching Sesame Street and reading lots of Roald Dahl. This foundation is evident here, from the quality of the writing to the twistiness of the plot and the complexity of the real-life issues the characters are dealing with (not to mention one kid who comes from Spain and speaks fractured English). There are strong themes of responsibility, loyalty, and friendship, and complex ethical questions. Iacopo Bruno's Gothic-tinged illustrations add to the intrigue.","Parents need to know that The Ability is a brilliant, suspenseful debut from M.M. Vaughan about kids with telepathic powers being trained in mind control as part of a secret operation. Some young readers may find certain aspects of the story bewildering or scary: a young girl is abandoned and left for dead by her companions, people have their minds essentially wiped clean, animals are abused as part of the kids' training, and the protagonist's mom, devastated by the death of his soldier dad, is in a state of mental collapse and has spent seven years sitting in a chair surrounded by trash. The darkness of The Ability is essential to the good-vs.-evil plot, as well as to the development of the characters and their ability to rise above bad beginnings. It also offers food for thought about such big issues as revenge, national security, and adults exploiting kids and animals to achieve their various purposes.

","This lively collection of stories about pioneering women and girls is sure to inspire and entertain both kids and adults. Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls encourages kids to think big, follow their dreams, never give up, and never listen to anyone who says you can't achieve something because you're female. It's great as a read-aloud for boys and girls or independent reading for older kids and offers a wonderful introduction to the many possible career paths open to all. A sobering message in the preface reminds readers how much these extraordinary women struggled for recognition and respect: ""No matter the importance of their discoveries, the audacity of their adventures, the width of their genius -- they were constantly belittled, forgotten, in some cases erased from history. It is important that girls understand the obstacles that lie in front of them. It is just as important that they know these obstacles are not insurmountable.""","Parents need to know that Good Night Stories for Rebel Girls is a collection of 100 one-page stories about women throughout history who broke barriers and achieved great things.

The Cat Who Liked Potato Soup,Homespun tale of an uppity cat and grumpy old man.,"Normally, the old man and the cat live together out in the country where they go fishing during the day, eat potato soup together at night, and generally share a life. The old man grumbles about the cat, and the cat acts aloof as cats are prone to do. Then, one day, the cat does not get up to go fishing, the man leaves without her, and they both learn important lessons about what life would be like if the other weren't around.
","Warm, expressive watercolor-and-gouache paintings help create the tender though curmudgeonly tone that enriches the story.

Once she was a little girl just like Katie and she loved fancy shoes, dancing on trash can lids, and eating frosting roses.
","This book captures the cozy feeling of listening to a parent share their childhood stories -- from the times they got into trouble or behaved less than perfectly to the games they loved to play. What a pleasure it is to know that parents really do understand why siblings argue and why it's so hard to be quiet when mom is on the phone. Kids will get the picture that parents are people with their own likes and dislikes, even if they're too busy with grocery lists and bills to always indulge their interests.
Very young kids may not quite understand that the mom in the story is not the same as the mom who might be reading the story, but older kids probably will be inspired to cuddle up and ask their parents about their own best memories.

The Janitor's Boy,Gets to the heart of a father-son relationship.,"Jack feels so humiliated by the fact that his father is the school janitor that he decides to get revenge by smearing a desk with gum. When he's caught, his punishment is to scrape gum off desks for three weeks after school, leading to discoveries about his dad's past.
By fifth grade, Jack has learned to be embarrassed by his father's profession--janitor. When Jack begins class in the building where his dad, John, is head custodian, Jack's worst nightmare comes true. The other kids find out, in an especially humiliating way, what his father does for a living. Blaming his father, he decides to get revenge. He determines what is the stickiest and smelliest gum (Bubblicious watermelon flavor), chews up thirteen pieces, and smears them all over the bottom of a desk and onto the seat, knowing full well who will have to clean it up.
But he is caught, and his punishment is to spend three weeks after school helping out his father by scraping gum off desks, starting with the one he so efficiently ruined. This begins a voyage of discovery for Jack into the hidden recesses of the school and of his father's past.
","Andrew Clements deftly mines deep emotional territory here: the complex and difficult relationship between father and son. But this book contains a rare alchemy -- the author is able to have Jack find independent resolution of his problems without resorting to writer's stratagems to get the parents out of the way. He brings Jack through trials to a greater understanding of himself and his father, but he does it without villains. Jack grows, not in spite of stupid or venal adults, but hand in hand with caring, wise grown-ups who know when to step in and when to step back.
The author knows schools -- the student pecking order, the faculty politics, the brightly lit classrooms and dim dusty recesses of school geography. For young readers, the little details ring true and give them new insights into the world they inhabit. Most children's books have happy endings, but this ending will bring both a grin to the face and a lump to the throat. It may not be the way the world works, but it's the way it ought to.","Parents need to know that though not much actually happens, it's a page-turner anyway.

"The Amulet of Samarkand: The Bartimaeus Trilogy, Book 1",Witty and sharp fantasy with complex characters.,"In an England in which magicians are the aristocracy and run the government nd ordinary people are beginning a revolt, apprentice magician Nathaniel is humiliated by a powerful government official, Lovelace, and devotes his life to revenge. Finding his master, Mr. Underwood, weak both in character and magic, he teaches himself from books and finds in himself a level of talent that no one else suspects.
To begin his revenge, he calls up a powerful djinn, Bartimaeus, and orders him to steal the powerful amulet of Samarkand from Lovelace nd hide it in Underwood's study. But he's underestimated both the power of his opponent and the complexity of the politics involved, and he soon finds himself in far over his head, with only his captive, restive, and contemptuous djinn to protect him.
","This heir to the Potter mantle is a worthy successor, combining a rich, complex story, a delightfully acerbic voice, and an original protagonist. Among many pleasures here is a very different system of magic, detailed by the snide and chatty Bartimaeus in a series of footnotes.
As with many other Rowling wannabes, the author has learned that children love reading fat books, but he still has something to learn about pacing. Tighter editing could have produced a book 100 or so pages shorter without sacrifice. But it's a witty, fun ride nonetheless, destined to be popular and have fans waiting eagerly for the next installment.","Parents need to know that The Amulet of Samarkand is the first book in the Bartimaeus trilogy, written before the author's popular Lockwood & Co. ghost-hunter series. Since it concerns magicians who get their powers from summoning demons and there are a lot of power-hungry magicians, expect plenty of fantasy violence. Magicians die in fires and explosions, by being swallowed by a demon, and from being sucked into an abyss. One of the main characters, 12-year-old Nathaniel, is beaten until he's unconscious, knocks others unconscious, causes the death of one magician who falls and breaks his neck, and gets into fistfights. Readers will root for Nathaniel even though it's clear that he's driven too much by ambition and revenge. He's also driven by the need to save others and never takes the easy way out -- he throws himself into dangerous situations at every turn. And when his head gets too big, the sardonic djinn Bartimaeus is always there to take him down a peg.

But if the stone fell into the wrong hands, it would mean the fall of Rome nd possibly all of civilization along with it. Oh, and making the Jupiter Stone will almost certainly cost him his life, too. Can Nic protect himself and his loved ones nd save the empire?
","This last installment in the Mark of the Thief trilogy keeps the exciting action of the first two books going. Wrath of the Storm also adds a dash of romance as teens Nic, Crispus, and Aurelia learn to face their futures. Fans of magical fantasy will enjoy creatures such as a unicorn, a griffin, and a dragon. The setting in ancient Rome adds appeal for historical fiction fans, too. The pace is pretty evenly split between action sequences and talking strategy. Veteran fantasy fans may get impatient with some of the repetition, such as how many times Aurelia has to tell Nic she's not leaving him. But big kids and tweens will enjoy being caught up in this magical adventure in ancient Rome.","Parents need to know that Wrath of the Storm is the third and last book in the Mark of the Thief fantasy series by the author of the Ascendance Trilogy. It picks up right where Book 2, Rise of the Wolf, left off. Reading the first two volumes isn't strictly needed because everything's pretty well explained, but it'll add dimension to a lot of the returning characters if you do. There's lots of peril and action, mostly from fights with fantasy creatures. Injuries and blood get mentioned but aren't described in detail. A whipping is described with a little detail and descriptions of pain but no gore. Nic thinks a lot about his feelings for Aurelia, and there's one deep kiss; it's not described, but feeling an intense emotional connection is described briefly.

Waiting,Toys calmly take in whatever happens in Zen-like tale.,"Five toys (a pig with an umbrella, a bear with a kite, a puppy on a sled, a rabbit with stars on its collar and a flexible accordion body, and an owl with spots) patiently wait for whatever comes next outside their window -- rain, snow, wind, lightning -- or inside their room, such as the introduction of a new toy. Whatever happens, they're cool with it: ""The rabbit with stars wasn't waiting for anything in particular. He just liked to look out the window and wait."" Sometimes gifts appear on the window ledge. Sometimes a new toy comes and goes. Sometimes they see spectacular events outside, such as a rainbow or fireworks.

Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw,"More funny antics, clueless behavior in 3rd installment.","Like its predecessors, there's no real story here. Greg torments and is tormented by his siblings, schemes to avoid work and learning, tries vainly to impress a girl, manipulates his one friend, and is treated unfairly by parents and teachers.
","There are two ways to look at this story and, indeed, the whole series: One is that it's a humorous, short, easy-to-read book that appeals to reluctant readers, and ll of that is true. It's the illustrations that make it particularly funny -- simple b&w cartoons that are so brilliantly done that they convey both the characters as well as Greg the narrator's attitude towards them, and yet somehow still remain believable as a kid's drawings. Along with that comes text that always ensures that the reader knows more than Greg and can have the uh-oh pleasure of anticipating what is going to go wrong.
	The other way to look at it is that the story is basically The Three Stooges without the nasty violence, or perhaps an extended version of America's Funniest Home Videos. Every single character, major or minor, adult or child (including, especially, the narrator, Greg), is pretty clueless, often devious and mean as well, and much of the humor derives from watching them get humiliated. There's no real plot, no character growth, no lessons, just the dubious pleasure of feeling superior to these characters. So if your kids like it, fine; it probably does no harm. But as to the argument that we need books like this to entice reluctant readers to read, one can hope that J. K. Rowling has forever dispelled that notion.","Parents need to know that while there is none of the usual kind of objectionable content, every character, both adult and child, behaves badly, and often dishonestly. Humor centers around siblings tormenting each other and friends manipulating, lying to, and stealing from one another. Plus kids hand out nasty Valentine cards, parents lie to their children and steal their snacks, students avoid learning, and teachers behave unfairly and unreasonably.

"Funny, Funny Lyle",Explores motherhood through a child's eyes.,"Lyle the crocodile is happy to have his mom at home and spreading joy throughout the neighborhood. But Lyle learns that even mothers can make mistakes when she is arrested. Meanwhile, surrogate mom, Mrs. Primm, is pregnant. The addition of Lyle's mom to the series takes a surprising but interesting turn.
 ","Written more than a decade after the previous book in the Lyle series, this book reflects changing times -- but the warmth of the series hasn't changed. Waber once again makes it look easy to address complicated ideas in a picture-book format. His cartoony line drawings are more colorful than ever and filled with detail, like the pictures in the original Babar book. And, as in the Babar series, life continues to have its ups and downs, but each new event leads to new opportunity.
The author also introduces some moral complexity. Though he practices defending the house from burglars, Lyle must deal with seeing his mother's arrest for theft, although it is clearly cultural naiveté that causes her to commit the crime. She pays her dues in a way that integrates her into society, but at the cost of losing time spent with Lyle. This strand of the story can lead to some interesting parent-child discussions.","Parents need to know that Bernard Waber pushes his well-known crocodile into new explorations of real-life issues in a gentle and entertaining way. The pictures are still amusing but lack the expressiveness of illustrations from earlier entries in the series.

Ava believes her nemesis, Judicus van Drood, is behind the disappearance. Once she locates the missing girl, Ava enters Blythewood Academy for her second year. But she's worried that her friends and the teachers will discover her secret: that she's a half-Darkling. While at school, Ava must figure out her feelings for the Darkling Raven, and how to reveal her secret without becoming an outcast and being banished to live in Faerie. Ava and her friends must also stop van Drood from wreaking more havoc and releasing more evil and demons into the world.
","Just like series opener Blythewood, RAVENCLIFFE is a gloomy, gothic and atmospheric novel. It has an array of likable and unlikable characters, including Ava, Raven, and Judicus van Drood. Readers will immediately be swept up, once again, into the excitement of old New York. Goodman definitely knows her early 19th century history. The first 12 chapter are spent in New York searching for a missing girl, but there's still plenty of magic, mischief, adventure, and even a ball to keep readers entertained before Ava arrives back at Blythewood. There are new teachers, and readers will get to meet Raven's parents and discover who Ava's father is, as well as the meaning behind Ravencliffe.
The novel ends on a cliffhanger and leaves readers wondering what happens next to Ava and her friends in the final installment. There's so much to like in this series -- from the heroic and unusual cast of characters and historical setting to the terrific plotting to the  fantasy and supernatural elements weaved naturally into the narrative.","Parents need to know that Ravencliffe is the second book in Carol Goodman's exciting Blythewood Tales series, following Blythewood. Set in early 19th century New York, it features a mythical world of fairies, angels, dark angels and other magical creatures at a secret boarding school for girls, Blythewood Academy, where they're trained to defend humans from the shadowy forces among us. War, slavery, corruption, race, religion, love, including loving someone of the opposite sex, are discussed. There's very little violence, but one character is killed and one is kidnapped.

Gameboard of the Gods,Dystopian thriller for adults OK for mature teens.,"GAMEBOARD OF THE GODS takes place in a futuristic United States that was destroyed by religious extremists. The United States is now called RUNA (Republic of United North America). Mae Koskinen works for the government and is asked to locate Dr. Justin March, who's living outside RUNA in Panama. But Mae also has a mission: She must work with Justin to solve a string of murders related to religious extremism and segregation. Mae is a strong fighter -- tough and no-nonsense. But when she encounters Justin, she immediately falls for him despite the two ravens that talk inside his head, his drug addiction, and his womanizing ways.
","Although the story is unique and will appeal to fans of dystopian and post-apocalyptic literature, it might start to bore some readers, especially teens.
Gameboard of the Gods is Richelle Mead's first adult novel. She's has garnered many teen fans through her YA series Vampire Academy and Bloodlines. But Gameboard of the Gods is very different from those books. It's definitely for adults, but older teens may gravitate toward it because they've read the YA series. Gameboard of the Gods features strong language, sex, violence, drug use, as well as heavier and more mature themes than those found in Mead's YA books.
The two main characters use each other for their own means and often clash and fall into lust throughout the story. Justin is likable, although somewhat of rake. Mae is cold and calculating. The most interesting character is Tessa, a teen who works alongside Justin. Mead does a good job with world-building. There is some heavy info dumping and a military-type setting, so all in ll, the book might appeal more to men and older teen boys than females.","Parents need to know that Gameboard of the Gods is the first book in the Age of X series, and the first book for adults by Richelle Mead, bestselling author of the Vampire Academy and Bloodlines young adult fantasy series. It's a dystopian thriller with a few graphic sexual situations, strong language (""ass,"" ""s--t,"" ""goddamnit,"" ""f--k,"" ""hell,"" ""prick,"" ""bastard""), and violence (hand-to-hand combat and murder) that's written for adults, but older teens might enjoy it. The story involves ritualistic murders and a serial killer, and includes discussions of politics, religious extremism, the military, and conspiracies. The characters are mainly adult, but there's a 16-year-old secondary character. Adults, including the main characters, drink, smoke, and take drugs.

These are only a few of the numerous shark species illustrated in this slim overview of sharks. Attractive illustrations and text sound bites provide readers an introduction to the underwater world and one of its most feared denizens.

What child doesn't want to read about sharks -- especially after viewing the cover illustration of a great white shark's jaws agape, ready to grab its next meal? Shark-related terms are defined in the text, which is generally clear and understandable.
The author includes topics likely to appeal to children, including how sharks locate their prey, the structure of their teeth and jaws, and the potential for shark attacks on a humans. The more gruesome aspects of sharks are countered by addressing how scientists study sharks, and the fact that sharks may become endangered. Attractive, clear illustrations show sharks swimming, attacking prey, and resting on the sea floor.","Parents need to know that the book counters the more gruesome aspects of sharks by addressing how scientists study sharks, and the fact that sharks may become endangered.

Hoot,Award-winning tale has environmental theme.,"Roy is the new kid in school, and is already being picked on by the school bully, Dana. But one day, while having his face mashed against the bus window, he sees a mysterious barefoot boy running away from the bus and school. Roy tracks him down and discovers, among other things that the boy, who calls himself Mullet Fingers, is committing acts of vandalism against a construction site where they plan to build a pancake restaurant on land where rare and endangered burrowing owls are nesting.
Meanwhile, in dealing with Dana, Roy finds that getting the better of him only seems to make him more dangerous. Fortunately, he finds an ally in Beatrice, Mullet Finger's stepsister, who's even tougher than Dana. And Mullet's pranks, rather than discouraging the foreman of the construction crew, seem to make him more dangerous.
","Carl Hiaasen's first novel for children has many likable characters, and Roy's parents stand out as caring, concerned, intelligent, and ultimately supportive.

Peter and the Starcatchers,A swashbuckling high-seas adventure.,"Peter and four other orphans are taken aboard a rickety old ship, the Never Land, to be delivered as servants to the evil king of Rundoon. Also on board the ship is Molly, daughter of the British Ambassador to Rundoon, and a mysterious trunk filled with a special treasure. The feared pirate Captain Black Stache knows there's a valuable treasure on board, though he doesn't know what it is. Peter befriends Molly and finds out that she and her father are Starcatchers, members of a centuries-old secret society that protects humanity by making sure that evil people don't get their hands on starstuff, magical material that falls from the stars and changes the nature of everything it touches.
Through storm, treachery, and shipwreck, Peter, Molly, and the boys end up on an island with the treasure, the pirates, fierce natives, the villainous first mate of the Never Land, mermaids created by the starstuff, and a giant crocodile. While Peter and Molly try to get the starstuff for the Starcatchers, everyone else is battling to get it for themselves.
","Though this book is unnecessarily long, it's an exciting adventure, fun in its own right.
It rarely works when a modern author seeks to write a sequel (or in this case a prequel) to a classic, and humor columnist Dave Barry, one of our reigning Sultans of Snide, hardly seems like the person to give it a try. But though his background shows up in the occasional and unnecessary sexual innuendo, otherwise this works surprisingly well.
He and co-author Ridley Pearson make some good choices at the outset. They do not attempt, in style, plot, or atmosphere, to mimic J.M. Barrie's masterpiece. Instead they cleverly create and bring together almost all of the characters and elements of the original: pirates, natives (no longer Indians in these culturally sensitive times), lost boys, mermaids, fairies, the crocodile, fairy dust, flying, not growing up, and the enchanted island itself.","Parents need to know that there's a fair amount of sexual innuendo for a book aimed at tweens.

Guy in Real Life,"Sweet, utterly believable romance/fantasy explores identity.","Lesh is a sophomore, dresses in black, and listens to heavy metal. Svetlana's a senior, wears long, flowing skirts, and listens to anything from Bjork to Berlioz. He starts getting into online RPGs, and she's a Dungeon Master in the school's table-games club. Thrown together with the worst (earliest) lunch schedule, they get to know each other and realize people are more than what they show to the world. After they discover their common interest in fantasy gaming, Lesh tries to blend his budding attraction to Svetlana with an online character. But things quickly get out of hand, and, when the truth comes out, Lesh may have lost Svetlana for good.
","GUY IN REAL LIFE accomplishes a lot in the guise of a teen romance. It's a heart-meltingly adorable look at first love, sure, but it's also an intriguing exploration of how to figure out your identity and show it to the world. It points out gender bias and double standards and enters fantasy realms where monsters are slain and heroes are made. Seamlessly weaving these elements together are the rock-solid narrative voices of two very different, and very believable, teen characters; kids will easily relate to Lesh and Svetlana as they take turns telling the story. Getting inside both of their heads shows us that people are more than what meets the eye.
Kids who don't like fantasy may feel the fantasy passages bog the whole thing down, but try not to skim those sections: They're a big part of how the characters learn who they are -- and who the world thinks they are -- and why or whether that matters.","Parents need to know that Guy in Real Life is a sweet high school romance, with some fantasy elements related to role-playing games. There are a couple of instances of kissing and making out, and one teen experiments with alcohol and learns its pitfalls the hard way.

Gert Garibaldi's Rants and Raves: One Butt Cheek at a Time,Hilarious high school angst with frank sex talk.,"Gert has some issues. She is traumatized by high school but must spend her days trying to navigate the awkwardness, the popular kids, the insane teachers, crushes, and dating. Her crush Lucas doesn't really know she's into him, her best friend Adam keeps dragging her out on dates with his crush Tim, her eyebrows are bushy, and her parents are old. All she can really do is rant and rave about the despair that is high school -- and she does it well.
","Gert's voice is very honest, real, and hilarious; Amber Kizer captures the feelings of being a 15-year-old girl with remarkable accuracy and compassion. And readers will believe Gert's transformation from an angsty teen into a girl becoming comfortable with herself. The pace is terrific and the ending, though great, will leave readers wanting more. They will be delighted to know that this book is part of a planned series.
Readers will enjoy and commiserate with Gert's laments over being the third wheel on her best friend's dates and her parents' general cluelessness. They will understand her rants over boys, hypocritical teachers, and the effort of trying to fit into a world in which some kids seem to have gotten a guide book and others are left to fend for themselves.

Impostors,All action and cool tech in Uglies Quartet spin-off.,"In IMPOSTORS, no one in the town knows that Rafi, the first daughter of Shreve, has a twin sister. Frey is hidden away by their father, trained to fight since the age of 7, and doubles for Rafi in crowds and public appearances whenever there's danger. And there's always danger. When the girls are 15, Frey saves Rafi from an assassin. No one likes their father, a greedy man who takes strict control of his town. The leader of Victoria especially despises him, but enlists his help to stop rebels from stealing metal from their rusty ruins. To ensure the Shreve army doesn't take more than what's agreed upon, they demand the first daughter of Shreve as a hostage until the army departs. So, of course, Frey jumps into the role in Rafi's place, as she was born to do. She makes her first trip outside of Shreve to a city so unlike her own.  ","This page-turner set in the world of the Uglies Quartet is high on action and low on character development. Impostors starts out with the flashback of an assassination attempt, sets up the idea of the ""spare"" warrior twin, and offers her up as a hostage before we even hit page 30. That's ideal for impatient readers who want the action to start immediately, and action with cool flying cars and high-tech chameleon suits -- there's plenty of that.
But readers who want to know more about characters' motives and personalities will feel like much is left out. Frey ponders only briefly her whole difficult childhood of being hidden and loved only by her sister. There's a lot more to explore there, and with the secondary characters as well. How did Yandre become a secret rebel? Where did Dr. Leyva and Boss X come from? And Zura is on the page long enough in various attacks that she deserves a little bit of a backstory. Why is she a Special when that's out of fashion now? Here's hoping the next book in the series slows down the action just enough to make these characters more memorable.","Parents need to know that Impostors is the first book in a spin-off to the future-set Uglies Quartet. You don't have to read the Uglies series first to enjoy this book, but it helps to understand some of the backstory and the cool tech. As readers explore two futuristic cities in Impostors, they're shown the stark difference between leaders who lead their people and leaders who control people. When these cities and rebels begin to fight it out, there are lots of causalities: hovercars shot down, missiles, mines that move, and more. There's not a lot of gore, except for a scene where a special knife vaporizes the top half of someone's body. There's also not a lot of other mature content: some kissing, and 16-year-olds drink champagne at a party.

Monster,Provocative book about teen on trial for murder.,"Steve's in jail, on trial for murder. He's young, he's terrified, and he's black. He's sure no one will believe him. Does Steve even believe in himself? You decide when you read this fast-moving book written like a movie script. The courtroom mystery hits home with enough drama and realism to attract even reluctant readers.
 ","The suspense and drama keep reluctant readers turning the pages, while more advanced readers will respond to the issues raised. Walter Dean Myers writes about human beings who make their own choices and react to their own circumstances -- even the minor characters have enough individuality to ring true -- and, as a result, teen readers care about them. They want Steve to be found not guilty, even as they try to figure out if Steve really is guilty. Steve's feelings about himself, his terror of jail, and his reaction to the epithet ""monster,"" leave the reader guessing.
The format of this taut story regulates the pacing. Edge-of-the-seat courtroom scenes written entirely in dialogue wind the reader up, then thoughtful journal entries allow readers to catch their breaths. Readers can feel Steve's terror and confusion, and will ponder Myers' point about how the road from innocence to trouble is taken in small, almost invisible steps, each involving a ""lack of positive moral decision.""","Parents need to know that this book is about a teen on trial for murder. While part of the story is told as a movie script, it employs highly realistic writing, with both poor and proper grammar used appropriately for each character. Grainy photographs contribute to the realistic atmosphere. There is some gritty material: characters are beaten up, the rape of inmates is implied, and Steve is terrified of being sent to prison. The high drama in this dialogue-driven story will appeal to even reluctant readers. And teens will appreciate debating whether Steve's guilty or not, and related issues, such as the fairness of our judicial system.

The Edge of Nowhere,Decent start to girl-who-hears-others'-thoughts series.,"Becca can hear whispers -- bits of other people's thoughts. When she discovers that her stepfather has committed a terrible crime, she and her mom go on the run to hide from him. Her mother puts Becca on a boat to Whidbey Island, near Seattle, and sets off for Canada to set up a safe new home. But the plan goes awry right from the start, and Becca finds herself completely alone, cut off from her mother and any support. Becca starts to carve out a fragile existence, befriending a talented musician who dropped out of school and a popular boy adopted from Uganda. But she soon finds herself enmeshed in a mystery that strains her new friendships -- and puts her in danger.
","THE EDGE OF NOWHERE is mystery writer Elizabeth George's first novel for younger readers, and it's a long but decent yarn. The supernatural aspect adds complexity without overwhelming the narrative. George visits the story from the perspective of multiple characters, some of whom seem likely to play larger roles in future installments.
 That said, even aside from Becca's ability to hear people's thoughts, the plot lacks credibility. Character motivation can be muddy to downright baffling, but George makes an effort to give each person some depth and surprising facets. Hopefully Becca will grow and mature as the series continues.","Parents need to know that The Edge of Nowhere is the first in a trilogy with a supernatural twist: Fourteen-year-old Becca can hear the fragmented thoughts of people around her. No violent acts take place in the book, but fear drives many of the young characters. Becca's self-image has an odd prominence in the story. Her mom heckles her about her weight and eating habits, and Becca in turn is hard on herself. Regular biking around the island she's on and circumstances that make it hard for her to get a decent meal give her a svelte figure by book's end, but that may not be a great message for teens with body-image issues.

Addie on the Inside,Vivacious seventh grader expresses herself in vivid poems.,"Tall 13-year-old Addie Carle has always been a strong, smart, and sensitive girl who has felt sure of herself and her place in the world ... until now. Her seventh-grade year is a kind of \""purgatory,\"" and  through narrative verse, she reveals her inner thoughts and feelings -- as well as the familiar markings of a very tough year: She's the first one to raise her hand in class and always has an opinion, but that's not going over well with the other kids. She worries about human rights and other world issues while most of the other kids seem like they couldn't care less. She hates the mean girls but feels their power. She endures teasing about her boyish looks, her independent spirit -- and even gossip about why a popular older boy would choose her to be his girlfriend. And, hardest of all, she begins to question herself and who she is.
","Addie's voice is straightforward and true, and the author's poems vividly and sensitively capture her pain and confusion. While the problems she struggles with are familiar, the book is one of a kind, both in its artistry and in the thoughtful questions -- and lessons -- it imparts. Howe challenges his readers to open their eyes, minds, and hearts and to try to really see one another, to allow people to choose who they want to be and respect them for their choices. (He writes, ""what is it we see when we look at each other, especially at those who are different from us?"")

Fearing for their lives,17-year-old Marisol Morales and her 12-year-old sister, Gabi, fled El Salvador after their father disappeared and their brother was killed by a gang. They're asking for asylum, but will they get it? Marisol isn't sure. So they sneak out of the camp and hitch a ride with a mysterious woman, Indranie Patel, who works for the government and makes Marisol an extraordinary offer: Take part for one month in a medical experiment, and she and Gabi can remain in the U.S. Marisol learns she'll be the ""grief keeper"" for someone who's experienced a terrible trauma, taking that person's grief into her own body. It's dangerous, but Marisol is certain it's worth the risk if it will keep her and Gabi safe. After being told the experiment will help soldiers with PTSD, Marisol is surprised when she and Gabi are taken to a mansion outside Washington, D.C., and she's introduced to a white girl her own age, Rey Warner. Rey is overcome with grief after witnessing her twin brother's death, and wants nothing to do with Marisol or the experiment. But the girls begin a tentative friendship over a shared love of a fictional teen TV drama called Cedar Hollow. As the experiment progresses, Marisol and Rey discover they're sharing not only grief but also a coming to terms with their sexuality.
","Readers hoping for a spine-tingling page-turner are likely to be disappointed, but those wanting to learn more about the plight of young undocumented immigrants will be rewarded. The Grief Keeper is an unusual mix of the refugee experience, LGBTQ issues, and elements of science fiction that could help spark conversations between teens and parents about the role of immigrants (including those in their own families) in American history and how Americans should respond as a nation to those seeking new lives in the U.S.","Parents need to know that in Alexandra Villasante's novel The Grief Keeper, 17-year-old Marisol and her 12-year-old sister, Gabi, have fled their home in El Salvador and made the perilous journey to the United States border.

Just as Marisol is beginning to lose hope, a woman from the U.S. government makes her a remarkable offer. If she agrees to test an experimental medical device for one month, she and her sister will be able to stay in the country. The device is designed to transfer grief from a person suffering from a terrible emotional trauma to another person who will become their ""grief keeper."" Marisol expects to be paired with someone like a soldier with PTSD, but finds herself the grief keeper for Rey, a white girl her own age who comes from a wealthy, well-connected family. There's some profanity (""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""bulls--t,"" ""bitch,"" ""goddamn""), and flashbacks tell how Marisol and Rey's brothers died, but never in graphic detail.

Felix Travels Back in Time,Sophie's stuffed rabbit goes back in time.,"In this second installment in the Felix series, Sophie's stuffed rabbit goes back in time to visit six historical periods: the Stone Age, ancient Greece, the Viking era, the Middle Ages, feudal Japan, and North America before the displacement of Native Americans.
As in the other books in the series, Felix writes letter to Sophie, which are enclosed in envelopes glued to the pages. A pull-out poster at the end shows the places Felix visited and inclues a timeline with brief information about each period.
","Though it's a little more didactic than some of the other books in the series, this entry is still enjoyable, mainly because of the author's inspired gimmick -- the letters. Kids will derive great pleasure from taking the letters out of the envelopes and reading them until they become tattered. And, even in this e-mail age, some children may be inspired to write letters of their own.","Parents need to know that kids will get great pleasure from reading these letters, and may even be inspired to write letters of their own.

Sisters First,"Sweet, spunky celebration of sister love.","As SISTERS FIRST begins, the main character and narrator has no siblings, feels lonely, and wishes and prays for a sister: ""Please make us kind, with enormous hearts, / clever too, and very smart. / With soft hands to hold and rms to hug, / and gentle eyes that show deep love."" She gets her wish and the baby arrives. She's a little disappointed at first: ""You cried and you ate, but not much more. / (My new baby sister was a bit of a snore.)"" But she remembers her prayer nd realizes: ""If kindness was what I was asking of you, / I needed to be kind and patient, too."" In time, they become playmates and rely on each other for comfort and imaginative free play. Two other pairs of sisters are shown doing things together, too, both real (making pickles dipped in sprinkles) and in fantasy (flying hot air balloons, tap dancing in the clouds, being cat pirates on the sea and mermaids riding alligators).  ","With cute art and clever rhymes, this loving look at sisterhood is both spunky and sweet in describing what's meaningful about this special bond. ""Sisters are partners (mainly in crime), / We play tricks on our parents / and sneak treats at bedtime."" And having two other sister pairs in the mix adds fun and diversity.
Sisters First is lively, imaginative, nd full of positive messages, including the final couplet of the main character's prayer: ""And through many days, the best and the worst, / help us remember we are sisters first.""","Parents need to know that Sisters First is a picture book by twins Jenna Bush Hager, known as a Today show co-host, nd Barbara Pierce Bush, co-founder of Global Heath Corps. They are the daughters of former U.S. president George W. Bush.

The main characters in this book aren't twins but rather an older and younger sister. It shows the older one's patience in watching her sister grow from baby to playmate and friend. Two other sister pairs appear, too. One pair has brown skin and hair, and in the other pair, the older sister is White nd the younger one is Black.

"The Nerdy Dozen, Book 1","Spy-kid series kicks off with goofy plot, high-tech fun.","In real life, Neil Andertol is an underachieving target for bullies. But, online, he's famous as ManofNeil, a contender to take the top spot in the online jet-piloting game Chameleon. Real and virtual reality abruptly become enmeshed when Neil is snatched off the street and taken to an Air Force base. He's one of 12 top gamers recruited to rescue two pilots and recover the top-secret Chameleon jet. To pull off the mission, Neil will have to deal with his online archrival, an island populated by ostriches, and a vengeful boy bent on being the most important game developer ever.
","THE NERDY DOZEN, debut author Jeff Miller's first book in a new series, is a campy, over-the-top adventure that's well suited to reluctant readers and newcomers to the spy-kid genre. It's clumsily constructed, with flabby writing, hammy characters, and plot holes big enough to fly a jet through. Kids who don't mind the bumpy going will enjoy the silliness, and fans of online games will enjoy Neil's dream-come-true story. The best scenes put Neil at the controls, whether it's in front of a screen or in a cockpit.

The Gallery,Engaging 1929 mystery for tween historical fiction fans.,"In 1929, Martha is 12 years old and not doing well in school. So her mother gets her a job as a maid in the grand Fifth Avenue mansion where her mother is housekeeper. Martha learns that Rose, the lady of the house, never leaves her room, eats exactly the same thing every day, and spends most of her time rummaging through her collection of paintings by some of the world's greatest artists. Every now and then, Rose sends a few paintings to hang on the walls downstairs. The more Martha learns about the paintings, the more she gets the feeling Rose is trying to communicate something to the outside world. Just about everyone in that mansion is hiding something, and Martha is determined to learn the truth about THE GALLERY.
","Laura Marx Fitzgerald has created another engaging story that historical fiction and mystery lovers alike will enjoy. Tweens especially will relate to Martha's admirable pluck as she gets to the bottom of things. They'll also learn a bit about classical and modern painting and about the stock market crash that started the Great Depression.
The plot is well structured, with lots of intrigue that keeps the pages turning. The characters are colorful and well developed. Tweens will enjoy immersing themselves in the height of the Roaring Twenties. Fans of Under the Egg are sure to enjoy a new story and setting that still offer mystery, intrigue, and a smart girl getting to the bottom of it all. There's not a lot of depth here, but it's a fun way to expose young fans of historical fiction and mystery to a time and place they may not know much about.","Parents need to know that The Gallery is another mystery by Laura Marx Fitzgerald (Under the Egg), this time set in New York in 1929 and skewing to a slightly older tween and middle-grade audience. The two books have some common themes, but the stories are completely separate. The mystery surrounds a woman who seems to be a prisoner in her own home and whose husband may be trying to drive her insane by poisoning her. The Roaring Twenties setting includes many references to alcohol, and Martha's father shows alcoholic and drunken behavior. Other content is mild, but there are several references and a minor plot point involving the prevailing prejudice in the United States gainst Italians t that time and a newspaper headline that uses the ethnic slur ""wop."" Art history is another prominent theme, and kids will learn about some famous painters, symbolism in art, and art appreciation in general, although there's not as much detail about that as there was in Under the Egg.

Shiver,Does for werewolves what Twilight did for vampires.,"For years, Grace has watched the wolves outside her Mercy Falls, Minnesota home every winter. She is particularly drawn to one with stunning yellow eyes. She is certain that it is the same wolf who saved her from its pack who attacked her when she was a young girl. When Grace meets the wounded and temporarily human Sam, she knows from his yellow eyes that he is her wolf. Immediately drawn to one another, they fall in love during their first encounter. Sam leads two lives. He is human in the spring and summer, but he turns into a wolf when the temperature turns cold. The problem Sam faces is that the longer he remains a wolf, the less time he spends in human form. A time will eventually come when he will not change back and will forever be a wolf. That time is coming soon...
","Elegantly written, Stiefvater's story offers a unique and interesting take on werewolf lore. Grace and Sam, the two protagonists, are mostly defined by their love for each other, but the author avoids brooding melodrama by injecting a fresh and playful sense of humor in their interactions. They have great chemistry. The characters are appealing, intelligent, and well-defined. Their willingness to use their intellects to deal with the challenges they face is refreshing.","Parents need to know that although this is a werewolf story, there's more romance than horror. It's a love story between a boy and a girl; the boy just happens to be a werewolf. The passion between the characters grows throughout the story, and they do have sex once in a tastefully written fade-to-black scene. Compared to other paranormal romances like the Twilight saga, this novel stands out in the genre. The writing is fresh and lyrical, and the characters well-developed and credible.

"Team Moon: How 400,000 People Landed Apollo 11 on the Moon",Thrilling story of the people behind the mission.,"The story of the first Moon landing is a familiar one, but Catherine Thimmesh delves beneath that story to tell about a few of the people and organizations that made the project possible. From the seamstresses who sewed together the 22 layers of the spacesuits to the team that designed the parachute system that lowered the capsule into the ocean, TEAM MOON chronicles their efforts, special considerations, setbacks, and triumphs.
Illustrated primarily with archival photographs, the book includes extensive back matter, as befits an event as thoroughly chronicled as this one: an author's note, pictures and quotes from an assortment of team members, bibliography, chapter notes, additional sources (including many Web sites and other media), starting points for further exploration, info on other missions, an index, and a glossary.
","This book is beautifully done in large format, with lots of photos and quotations. And what a terrific idea for a children's book: using the built-in fascination of one of the greatest and most dramatic events of human history to explore the less glamorous but absolutely essential people and jobs that underlie any great achievement. The only problem is that 80 pages is far too few to provide more than a taste of the topic; it could easily have been two or three times as long and still have held young readers' interest.
At times, text superimposed on pictures is difficult to read, and the author's penchant for hyperbolic prose seems unnecessary in the face of such a hyperbolic event. But these are quibbles that won't bother most kids -- they will be too busy being enthralled by the adventure, the drama, and the fascination of the bit players who made the whole thing possible. Thimmesh has taken a grand idea and fleshed it out beautifully. It's not hard to imagine that this kind of book could inspire a child's direction in life.","Parents need to know that there is nothing to concern parents, and much to inspire children, in this book.

Koko's Kitten,Amazing true story of pet loss helps kids understand grief.,"Children love pets, and Koko the gorilla is no exception. When her keeper asks her what she wants, Koko insistently replies--in American Sign Language -- ""Cat, cat, cat."" Enter All Ball, a tiny kitten abandoned at birth, who isn't afraid of anything--even a 500-pound primate. This amazing true story captivates young listeners.
 ","Although this book's pages seem text-heavy, the story of these two mammal friends captivates even the youngest listeners -- and children seem even more engaged because the story is true. The photographs give the reader a closer-than-the-zoo look at one of our remarkable primate cousins. Kids gravitate toward the story and are eager to share their own pet tales after seeing Koko and All Ball at play.
And because the book expresses the despair and anger Koko feels after All Ball's sudden death, children who have also experienced the loss of a pet are encouraged to vent their feelings. Since Koko is renowned for her ability to communicate with humans, it seems appropriate that her tale opens the door for children to share their grief.","Parents need to know that Koko's Kitten is the true story of a gorilla who asks -- via American Sign Language -- for a pet cat, and then expresses nger nd sadness when the kitten dies suddenly.

"Her Dark Curiosity: The Madman's Daughter, Book 2",Horror-heavy sequel adds Jekyll and Hyde homage.,"After Juliet is jilted by Montgomery and set adrift in the Pacific, she starts her life afresh in London as the charge of Professor Von Stein, an old colleague of Juliet's father, the very one who supposedly turned Dr. Moreau in for his unethical animal experimentation. But though Juliet is a proper Victorian lady out in society again, she's still a girl with a big secret: The animal organs that saved her life as a baby are failing, and the serum she's taken her whole life now barely keeps the shaking and fainting spells at bay. So she finds a low-rent apartment, buys a chemistry set and fresh animal organs from the market, and starts to work on fixing the serum. She's so caught up in her work that it isn't until she's at the butcher one day that she sees her bloody organs wrapped in an even bloodier newspaper story: A serial killer is on the loose in London. The Wolf of Whitechapel, they call him. Not only does the Wolf claw his victims to death in a way Juliet remembers vividly, she also knows the names of the victims. Each had wronged her in some way. Was Juliet really the only one who escaped the island?
","What a great set-up: Juliet's back in London, but she's not alone; and Edward's not alone in his body -- Mr. Jekyll is what he calls himself in polite society. Ha. Even better, absolutely no one is who he or she seems to be, except probably Juliet's guardian and her friend Lucy.
The first two-thirds of HER DARK CURIOSITY keep the surprises coming. The last third -- well, except for a rousing, gory climax, there's a lot weighing it down. Too much talk about experiments and codes that sound pretty far-fetched; too much of Juliet brooding, feeling guilty about her love life, and hating her darker nature; and too much detail about the secret, sinister organization she's fighting against. And to end it, there's a pretty hasty set-up for the third book, which seems like a big departure from the first two. ","Parents need to know that Her Dark Curiosity, the sequel to The Madman's Daughter, is part of a horror-heavy sci-fi series. Continuing some of Book 1's themes of animal-human experimentation based on the H.G. Wells classic The Island of Doctor Moreau, it adds an homage to the Robert Louis Stevenson novella Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Now a serial killer -- one of Juliet's father's creations -- is rampaging through the city of London. He claws his victims to death; Juliet visits a morgue secretly for a closer look at the damage. The climax is gorier than the first book's, with wild animals ripping apart some humans, gunshots fired, and one man burning alive. So, yes, this is heavy on the horror like the first novel is. Also similar to the first, this has compelling themes of ethics in science. For example, when does scientific discovery cross a line? Characters drink and smoke, with mentions of hard liquor; Juliet, a teen, seems to stick to wine with dinner. The sexual content is more mature than it is in Book 1: Juliet sleeps with one suitor, though it's barely described, and kisses another before falling asleep with him.

Parked,"Poverty, homelessness explored in hopeful tale of community.","In PARKED, by debut novelist Danielle Svetcov, 12-year-old Jeanne Ann's mom tells her that they re moving from their home in Chicago to San Francisco. The pair of them are to travel across the country in n orange van that they've named The Carrot. There are shelves for books in the van, pans hanging from a rack, sleeping bags, and, when they get to San Francisco, a view of the Bay. But camping in the van loses its allure after a week, and Jeanne Ann's mom is having a really hard time finding work. A 12-year-old boy named Cal, who lives in a house nearby the van, takes an interest in Jeanne Ann and tries to help her. Life becomes more complicated as the days tick by, and Jeanne Ann realizes that her mom's inability to provide for them has them hanging by a thread. If she can accept the help of her new community, she just might get to have the things that she wants in life, like ccess to books, enrollment in school, an actual address, and maybe a good friend.
","This relatable and beautifully told story of struggle and friendship looks at poverty in America, while maintaining a feeling of hope. Romanticizing or criticizing the burden that Jeanne Ann and her mom face would cut into the momentum of the story, but it stays real, and at the same time, age-appropriate. Parked explores the sacrifice people make to realize their American dreams.
Parked is told in two voices: Jeanne Ann's and a boy named Cal, who watch each other from across the street. Cal lives in an ultra modern luxury home, whereas Jeanne Ann lives in a van. He's sensitive; she's tough. He wants to help; she refuses his charity. Kids will like the dance and tension between characters, and they will relate to Jeanne Ann's bility to survive on peanut butter and pretzels. But they will also root for Cal, whose awkward efforts to help really do come from the heart in this optimistic tale of survival in the big city.","Parents need to know that Parked is a middle-grade novel that explores what it means for a kid and her mom to survive in a van on the streets of a major American city. Jeanne Ann and her mom, Joyce, buy a van and drive from Chicago to San Francisco without a plan nd without much money. Jeanne Ann is already accustomed to spending long stretches of time without her mom, who works in the restaurant industry. In San Francisco, though, she can't camp in the stacks at the library while her mom's at work, for fear that the van -- holding all of their earthly belongings -- will be towed. Poverty is painted with broad strokes, and living in a van is a life-altering trial for Jeanne Ann, but the focus on family and neighbors keeps the story sunny and hopeful.

Daughter of Deep Silence,"Suspend disbelief for this dishy, exciting revenge tale.","DAUGHTER OF DEEP SILENCE is the story of one young woman's plan for revenge. The summer she was 14, Frances Mace and her parents went on a luxury cruise that changed her life forever. On the Persephone, she became fast friends with beautiful, wealthy Libby O'Martin and had a vacation romance with handsome Grey, the son of a South Carolina senator. But about 10 days into the cruise, a catastrophe struck the ship. Frances is one of only three survivors -- and the other two, Grey and Senator Wells, say one thing happened, but Frances knows it was something else. Libby's grieving father believes the now-orphaned Frances' story and offers her his protection by allowing her to take on Libby's identity. Four years later, following Mr. O'Martin's death, Frances, now living as Libby, returns to South Carolina to claim the one thing she wants most: revenge on Grey and his lying father -- if her feelings for Grey and the real Libby's former love Shepherd don't get in the way.
","If readers understand that this riveting book is more Revenge than Count of Monte Cristo, it won't be a surprise that the revenge plot eventually takes a backseat to soapier issues. Most prominent of those is Frances' inability to move beyond the memories of her first fling with Grey. Yes, she's bent on revenge, but she's also 18 and apparently never dated or kissed anyone in the four traumatic years following the events on the Persephone. So even though part of her plan is to make Grey fall in love with Libby and disclose the truth, Frances can't help but fall for the guy a second time.
The intensity of the two central romances -- Frances and Grey and Libby and Shepherd at age 14 -- may be difficult for some readers to get past. Shepherd is the one person who can foil Frances' plans, because he knew Libby from childhood and was her first love. Their love story is more believable, and he's the most fully realized secondary character in the book (and no doubt most readers' favorite). Grey and Frances/Libby are harder to root for, since the situation is so fraught with the trauma, stress, and grief of what happened on the cruise. Ryan, best known for her engaging zombie trilogy, knows how to write tension and romance, and if you don't mind the idea of freshmen falling madly, truly, deeply in love, then this is a delicious guilty pleasure you'll find hard to put down until the anticlimactic end.","Parents need to know that Daughter of Deep Silence is author Carrie Ryan's story of revenge and romance, based in part on the classic novel The Count of Monte Cristo and the first season of the soapy ABC drama Revenge. The romance includes many descriptions of first love, desire, making out, and intimacy, but there isn't any actual sex. The language is occasionally coarse, with ""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""a--hole,"" and ""bitch"" peppered throughout the dialogue. The violence is graphic and upsetting, particularly the recollections about what happened on the Persephone. Although the book deals with upsetting details about a mass murder, the killing of loved ones, and the cold details of how to pull off a revenge scheme, it's not so intense that a mature seventh-grader won't be able to grasp and enjoy it.

"Into the Firestorm: A Novel of San Francisco, 1906",Plucky orphan survives San Francisco's big quake.,"After his grandmother dies, leaving him alone, Nick runs away from his orphanage in 1906 Texas to San Francisco. For a while he lives on the streets, hungry, cold, filthy, and lonely, until he talks his way into a job at a stationery shop in exchange for a place to sleep in the basement. The owner even trusts Nick enough to leave him in charge of the shop overnight while he goes across the Bay on business.
But while he's gone the San Francisco earthquake strikes. As fire advances through the city, Nick tries to take care of the owner's dog, Shake, as well as a little girl from across the street and her pregnant, injured mother. Forced to evacuate, they head for Golden Gate Park, the last refuge of those who couldn't make it out of the city.
","Deborah Hopkinson's take is exciting and, at times, moving as the plucky, good-hearted orphan struggles to help others in the face of overwhelming disaster. The details of the earthquake and subsequent fire are gripping, most vividly in the characters' journey across the city while pursued by flames. Readers of this book surely will be reminded of a similar disaster that happened a century later -- the destruction of New Orleans by Hurricane Katrina. Though one was fire and the other flood, the stories are similar: Cities destroyed not so much by acts of nature as by the following failures of man. The differences lie in the effectiveness of the responses to the disasters.","Parents need to know that there's not much to be concerned about here: There's some drinking, and some of the citizens of San Francisco in this period were anti-Chinese.

Wings,"Romantic fairy fantasy, milder than Twilight.","Homeschooled Laurel enters a public high school and feels a bit different. But she feels even more so when a large blossom starts growing out of her back. Soon she discovers that she is a fairy changeling, placed with a human family to keep one of the gateways to the fairy world of Avalon safe. Torn between a human boy and a fairy, she also discovers that trolls are after her land, and that her human parents are in danger.
","This is clearly aimed at the Twilight crowd: a bit of chaste romance, a bit of violence, and a supernatural gloss on the real world. Instead of vampires and werewolves we get fairies and trolls, and the heroine this time is one of the supernatural creatures and one of the two boys she likes is human. It's a bit milder than Twilight: the romance is a bit less passionate, as befits the slightly younger age of the heroine and target audience.
	But unlike that earlier blockbuster, this series launch has something to offer those who aren't into mooning over hunky vampires, or even hunky fairies. There's a story here, with an intriguing variation on traditional fairy lore -- fairies, for instance, are actually plants, and what humans thought were wings are actually their blossoms. With the romance not so much in the reader's face, this should appeal to a wider audience than Twilight, though perhaps not as passionately.
 From the Book:
	She didn't even have to turn to see the new development. Long, bluish-white forms rose over both shoulders. For a moment Laurel was mesmerized, staring at the pale things with wide eyes. They were terrifyingly beautiful -- almost too beautiful for words.
	She turned slowly so she could see them better. Petal-like strips sprouted from where the bump had been, making a gently curved four-pointed star on her back. The longest petals -- fanning out over each shoulder and peeking around her waist -- were more than a foot long and as wide as her hand. Smaller petals -- about eight or nine inches long -- spiraled around the center, filling in the leftover space. There were even a few small green leaves where the enormous flower connected to her skin.","Parents need to know that this book gets rather violent near the end, with fighting, shooting, neck-snapping, and attempted drowning. There's also some kissing, a brief discussion of sex, and one use of a four-letter word.

Babe the Gallant Pig,"A lively, universal story of unlikely friendships.","Babe is not your ordinary pig: he's mannerly and intelligent--and one talented sheepherder! This delightful tale relates how one remarkable animal, with a little help from his friends, escapes the slaughterhouse to master an unusual skill and earn a secure place in hearts of readers.

","As animal fantasies go, BABE THE GALLANT PIG has earned the right to be compared favorably with the benchmark pig classic Charlotte's Web. It has all the necessary characteristics: suspense, kid appeal, plenty of emotion, and charismatic animal characters. Babe is the underdog -- er, underpig -- who, through sheer sincerity and genuineness, defies the odds in this heartwarming, farmyard equivalent of a rags-to-riches tale. It's an action-packed, universal story of unlikely friendships and even unlikelier triumphs, of forgiveness, determination, and the power that results from believing in oneself. Even the most disrespectful characters are ultimately reformed by Babe's positive example, providing a subtle yet effective lesson in virtuous behavior that won't be lost on readers of any age.
Part of the book's immense charm comes from the portions of dialogue that reflect rural British speech. In addition to deciphering the richly authentic dialect, some young readers will need assistance defining terms such as daft and cultural references such as dialing 999 when an emergency occurs. But don't let this be a deterrent; the UK influence will only serve to enrich the cultural, behavioral, and language lessons this remarkable book provides.","Parents need to know that the highly appealing story line is engaging, emotionally provocative, and at times suspenseful.

Wolf in the Snow,Girl rescues lost wolf pup in wordless tale of compassion.,"A girl in a red hooded jacket starts walking home from school as it starts to snow, hears a wolf pack, and notices a WOLF IN THE SNOW, a pup who's fallen behind and gotten lost. She picks it up and trudges through the snowstorm to bring it to the pack. Eventually pup nd mother are reunited, but by then the girl is lost and so exhausted she collapses into  ball. The wolves surround her and howl to alert the girl's dog and parents, who've been tracking her. So she, too, is rescued nd reunited with her mom. The last scene shows the girl and her family back home, warm and safe.
","This nearly wordless book creates a captivating landscape of peril and compassion starring a kind, brave little girl undaunted by nature and the nimal world. Author-illustrator Matthew Cordell's pen-and-ink with watercolor illustrations in Wolf in the Snow draw you in and make you care about the characters, showing the changing emotions on the girl's face, sometimes with only her eyes showing between her jacket hood nd the scarf around her neck.

Homeroom Diaries,Cyberbullied teens promote happiness in sweet misfit tale.,"Maggie -- or Cuckoo, as she calls herself -- has problems that many girls have. For example, she has uncooperative hair and is unsure if a cute boy in her group is asking her out as a friend or as a date. She also has some much bigger problems: Her flaky mother disappeared, leaving her alone and very sad. She had to be observed in a mental hospital and, after that, go to live with a loving but very frail neighbor. Luckily for Cuckoo, she has an amazingly supportive group of friends (who collectively call themselves the Freakshow, because they wanted a nickname ""that's far worse than anything any of the diseased minds in our school could dream up""). When their sweet group becomes the target of mean cyberbullying, she realizes she's not the only one who's feeling fragile. But, instead of planning revenge, the Freakshow focus on an idea for fixing their sick school culture.
","It's easy to fall in love with this band of misfits as they work on their happiness, hug one another in hard times, and devise a creative (if far-fetched) plan to make their school culture healthier. There are some great lessons in HOMEROOM DIARIES, such as Cuckoo's realization that, although she's currently (and understandably) sad, she can ""imagine a day when I'm just happy and nothing else.""
The black-and-white comic-book style illustrations make this book feel like a journal and add a bit of lightness to some pretty serious topics. And sweet, quirky Cuckoo, who tells bad jokes and dreams up a romantic character straight from a Jane Austen novel to get her through homeroom, is an engaging protagonist.","Parents need to know that Homeroom Diaries, by James Patterson and Lisa Papademetriou (Middle School: My Brother Is a Big, Fat Liar), can be used to open up conversations about cyberbullying as well as depression and suicide. It includes a list of hotlines for teens in need in the back matter, and black-and-white comic-book style illustrations throughout lighten things up and give the book the feel of a journal​. There are some great lessons here, such as protagonist Cuckoo's realization that, although she's currently sad, she can ""imagine a day when I'm just happy and nothing else."" Cuckoo's an easy character to love, because -- although she's sad about her situation -- she's also grateful for all the people who care for her. Her friends, too, while facing their own challenges -- including racism and poverty -- are really trying to make their school a better place by coming up with ideas for something they call Operation Happiness. There's some disturbing material, including a teen suicide attempt, a mean cyberbulling prank, and a drunk boy's sexual attack on a girl. Also, there are some words such as ""ass,"" ""bitch,""  ""crap,"" and ""slut"" and two uses of ""bulls--t.""

Down by the River: A Family Fly Fishing Story,Boy learns from his grandpa in warm family tale.,"Young Art loves loading up the car with fly fishing gear and spending the day DOWN BY THE RIVER with his mom, grandpa, and family dog, hearing stories of how Grandpa taught his mom how to fish when she was Art's age, 8. Art experiences some frustration at not being the ""natural"" his mom was and getting his line tangled in a tree. But, in the end, he catches a fish and makes a promise to himself: I'll never forget this. The next page has the story's last line, ""And he never did,"" above Art and his interracial family walking toward the river, as he presumably passes along the family lore and love of fly fishing.
","This sweet, gentle fishing tale celebrates family nd the power of shared memories. It's a quiet story that moves with the rhythms of the river and its calm pools. It acknowledges the boy's feelings of frustration and incompetence as he compares his skills with those of his mother nd captures his joy at finally casting well and catching a fish. Mainly, his pleasure comes from being with family, hearing his grandpa's stories, and having  memorable day out in nature.
Down by the River also offers a basic introduction to fly fishing, and April Chu's illustrations convey its intricacies and intimacies from varying perspectives -- close up, far away, and from a soaring osprey's-eye view -- in an autumnal palette of green, orange, yellow, red. Back matter explains and illustrates fly fishing practices (such as ""catch and release"") and vocabulary, nd endpapers showcase the diversity of flies crafted by humans to fool the fish. ","Parents need to know that Down by the River: A Family Fly Fishing Story, by Andrew Weiner and illustrated by April Chu, tells the story of a boy's day out fly fishing with his mom, grandpa, and family dog. Eight-year-old Art experiences ups and down, but the whole day becomes a treasured memory for him.

Symptoms of Being Human,"Empathetic, empowering story of gender-fluid teen.","It's hard enough to find where you fit in high school, but Riley has it harder than many: Riley feels like a girl some days, a boy on others, and often somewhere in between. Riley doesn't know how to explain this to family, much less classmates, so most days Riley strives to be neutral. But it doesn't work: Bullies soon target Riley, and new friendships are hamstrung by unasked questions and Riley's uncertainty. Starting an anonymous blog seems a safe outlet for Riley's pent-up feelings, but even that gets painfully complicated when well-intentioned advice to another non-gender-conforming teen becomes a news story. Even worse, someone at school knows Riley's secret, and the pressure may be too much to bear.
","Like its hero, this keenly observed portrait of a gender-fluid teen desperate to live authentically defies easy categorization. It has obvious appeal for LGBTQ teens and allies, but it's also a moving depiction of anxiety anyone can relate to. SYMPTOMS OF BEING HUMAN is a tenderly written and empathetic debut from Jeff Garvin, who remarkably avoids using any gender-specific pronouns in describing Riley and never reveals which gender Riley was assigned at birth.
The general plot line feels stale for this generation -- teen with nonconforming gender identity stays closeted, is sexually attacked, and decides to come out. But getting to know Riley could be a breathtaking experience for gender-fluid teens, who see so little of their reality reflected in mainstream media. And for friends, family, and anyone else trying to better understand gender dysphoria, Garvin writes with heartfelt compassion.","Parents need to know that Symptoms of Being Human deals frankly with a gender-fluid teen's high school experience, from cruel taunts and a horrific rape to the difficulty of finding and maintaining close friendships. The novel helps explain what it means to be gender-fluid and sheds light on the everyday challenges non-gender-conforming teens face. There are vicious bullies -- Riley is subjected to sexually explicit verbal abuse and repeated, violent attacks -- but also inspiring upstanders. Mental health issues figure prominently, including anxiety, panic attacks, and suicidal thoughts. But the takeaway message focuses on being true to yourself, taking a stand, and the importance of supporting each other.

Becoming Kareem: Growing Up On and Off the Court,Thoughtful memoir by basketball star and civil rights icon.,"BECOMING KAREEM: GROWING UP ON AND OFF THE COURT is an autobiography for young readers by author, activist, and NBA Hall-of-Famer Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He traces his journey from shy, oversized, straight-A student from the housing projects of New York City to socially conscious international celebrity, voice for change and black empowerment, and devout Muslim. Set against the backdrop of a racially divided and tumultuous America of the 1950s and '60s, Becoming Kareem follows the young Lew Alcindor through his awkward teen years, his intellectual awakening in high school and at college at UCLA, up to his early professional basketball career, describing his development not only as a player but also as a scholar, a writer, and an activist. Along the way, the coaches and teachers he meets, including boxing icon Muhammad Ali, legendary college basketball guru John Wooden, and martial arts pioneer Bruce Lee, help him find his voice and comprehend and combat the racism experienced by virtually all African-Americans at the time, a fight he has carried on to the present day. Kareem details the pain of experiencing prejudice from people he thought he could trust -- like the white friends who turned on him and the coach who tried to motivate him by using the ""N"" word -- and the thick skin he had to develop as a result. Crossing paths with celebrities and civil rights leaders, young Lew discovers the power and peril of being black and famous in an America that praises him for his athletic gifts but resents him for his commitment to justice. Eventually, he changes his name and embraces his newfound Islamic faith in an expression of his decision to become who he wants and needs to be, rather than who others expect him to be.
","Eloquent and poignant, Kareem's story is one of self-discovery, emotional and intellectual development, and hard-fought and well-deserved success. His insights into a troubled but exciting time for black Americans show how inescapable the fear caused by racism and police brutality was and is, even for a beloved superstar such as himself. His memoir reveals a complex and compelling thinker whose journey has transcended sports and inspired millions by using his platform to articulate the African-American experience, much like those who came before and influenced him, such as Muhammad Ali, Jackie Robinson, and countless others.
While basketball fans may be especially drawn to this autobiography by one of the sport's all-time greats, the lessons learned and wisdom offered are valuable to any young person searching for his or her place in a world filled with injustice and inequality. ","Parents need to know that Becoming Kareem: Growing Up On and Off the Court is an inspiring memoir for middle school readers about the trials and tribulations of one of the most accomplished athletes of all time as he came to understand his faith, his country, and himself. Having confronted racism (and racial slurs like the ""N"" word) nd criticism at every turn, Kareem writes about how the coaches in his life helped him find his place in the world and define himself s an African-American, a public figure, and a champion for social justice.

Time Flies,Wordless time-travel tale sparks imaginations.,"A bird's visit to the natural history museum takes an unexpected turn when he stops in the dinosaur room. Suddenly he's traveling back in time.
","It's no wonder this sumptuous book received the prestigious Caldecott Honor. Eric Rohmann's oil paintings are richly evocative, from the sepia-tinged illustrations of the museum scenes to the realistically hued images of dinosaurs.
Like many wordless picture books, TIME FLIES demands that the audience fill in the missing pieces. In this case the straightforward fantasy invites the reader to get caught up in the adventure one bird has flying back in time. Younger kids who love dinosaurs will simply be happy to visit their favorite creatures while older kids will be intrigued by the mystery and possibility. The realism -- including close-ups of one carnivore's mighty teeth -- might spook very sensitive kids, but the promised happy ending may be satisfying enough to get them through.","Parents need to know that there is nothing offensive about this book, but for children sensitive to depictions of dinosaurs, the close-ups of dinos may be a little intense.

Dooby Dooby Moo,Barnyard talent keeps kids and adults laughing.,"When Duck learns that there's a trampoline available as first prize in the state fair talent show, he's determined to bring that trophy home. Late-night rehearsals with the cows, sheep, and pigs flummox Farmer Brown, who can't figure out what's going on.
","DOOBY DOOBY MOO's as fun for grown-ups to read as it is for kids to listen to. Especially for parents who're willing to let their inner performer come out and sing along with the cows and sheep. The energetic and expressive illustrations lend loads of personality to the animals and the confused farmer. The type -- big and bold -- is well-suited to the story and the animal's voices are scrawled in a casual, scratchy print, making it easy to figure out when they start talking.
Funny footnotes might go over the kids' heads but will have adults chuckling. And the whole family's sure to root for Duck and his friends when the time comes to take the stage before the panel of judges (including one extra-discerning cat).","Parents need to know that Dooby Dooby Moo is a rollicking picture book from the creators of the Caldecott Honor Book Click, Clack, Moo: Cows That Type.

The 5 O'Clock Band,Trombone Shorty tale is joyous love letter to New Orleans.,"In THE 5 O'CLOCK BAND, Shorty plays trombone in the 5 O'Clock Band, so called because they played together ""every afternoon, after school and homework were finished."" One afternoon, he's engrossed in practice and forgets to meet the band. Shorty worries: How can he be a bandleader if he can't be on time? While chasing after his friends, he comes across a series of adults who greet him --""Shorty, where y'at?"" -- each giving him advice in turn. Musician Tuba Tremé tells him to keep tradition in mind. ""Every bandleader needs to know where music came from in order to move it forward."" Queen Lola feeds him from the window of her restaurant, advising him to infuse his work with love, as she does her cooking. And Big Chief of the Mardi Gras Indians counsels ""dedication."" When Shorty finally comes upon his band, he shares these ""ingredients for success."" As they march home to Tremé, they play ""When the Saints Go Marching In.""
","This joyous love letter to New Orleans feels like a surprise trip and a very happy jazz concert rolled into one, and readers can nearly hear the bright brass band parading to Jackson Square. The 5 O’Clock Band is written by Troy ""Trombone Shorty"" Andrews himself, along with co-author Bill Taylor, and illustrated by the incomparable Bryan Collier. The team's unbeatable. While it's unclear who wrote what -- did Trombone Shorty provide the New Orleans color and biographical detail, and Bill Taylor the picture book know-how?  However they divvied it, it works. Kids will relate to the story since it focuses on young ""Shorty"" as he leads his friends in a local brass band, and will have fun meeting the adult characters who bring out the special spice of one of our most distinct and colorful cities. ""Where y’at?"" In the Quarter!
Collier's art is staggeringly gorgeous. It's shot through with light and bright color, studded with textural collage elements, and celebrates the character of the city as well as the characters who people it.

In this book, all the elements combine to create a lovely celebration of the rich musical and cultural heritage of New Orleans.","Parents need to know that The 5 O’Clock Band by noted musician Troy ""Trombone Shorty"" Andrews, and illustrated by multi-award winner Bryan Collier, is a follow-up to their previous book, Trombone Shorty, which garnered both a 2016 Caldecott Honor and the Coretta Scott King Award. This book's a worthy companion, a story about young Shorty earning his music chops in New Orleans, and it brims with the life of that vibrant city. The message is stated outright: In order to succeed, you need dedication, love, and to honor tradition. And readers won't be able to look away from Bryan Collier's gorgeous, colorful art.

A Girl Named Digit,"Fun story of math whiz girl who fights crime, finds romance.","Math genius Farrah has tried to act like a regular high school girl and distance herself from a painful middle school nickname: Digit. But when she cracks a code that an eco-terrorist group has been broadcasting on a popular teen TV show, she finds herself in serious danger -- and under the protection of a young, handsome FBI agent. Between hiding out, jumping out of moving taxis, and staking out bad guys from a Central Park tree, Farrah and John find themselves in a deeper mystery -- and in love with each other. As she uses her genius skills to thwart another terrible terrorist tragedy, she also learns that \""someone could love me\"" for being Digit, her true, brainy self.
","There's not enough clever spy stuff to put this in a league with Ally Carter's similar tale, but it’s a fun enough book that celebrates smart, brave girls and the importance of being yourself. Tweens may find it a bit heavy on romance and a little light on actual code breaking, but readers looking for a beach book with a little bit of heart will find enough to satisfy them. Digit's transformation into a tough girl who's able to be her true self is realistic -- and worth cheering.","Parents need to know that readers will learn somethings about cracking codes in A Girl Named Digit -- and get a strong message about the importance of being their true selves. However, there's a surprising level of violence here: An eco-terrorist group kills eight people during a bombing at JFK airport and has another attack planned for Disney World. John's boss at the FBI had been kidnapped and tortured by this same group and is missing all the fingers of one hand. There's also gunplay and threats of shooting, one character commits suicide, and students at Farrah's school think that she's been kidnapped and maybe raped. Beyond that, there's a romance between John, the 21-year-old FBI agent, and 17-year-old Farrah; they kiss and spend the night together, but nothing beyond snuggling takes place.

"King's Cage: Red Queen, Book 3",Author returns to form with nail-biting third installment.,"KING'S CAGE is Victoria Aveyard's third book in the best-selling Red Queen series following Red-born Mare Barrow, who has even greater powers than those born with Silver blood, and the king's cage is the symbol of a revolution to overthrow the oppressive Silver rulers. Starting shortly after Glass Sword ends, Mare is in King Maven's custody, having exchanged her freedom for the safety of Silver-blooded Prince Cal, the Scarlet Guard, and the Newbloods she had rounded up to fight Maven. Back at the palace, Maven has Mare interrogated by his Silver cousin who can manipulate and search her mind -- but he also dolls her up to show off like a pretty puppet. Maven forces her to make statements renouncing the Scarlet Guard and asking Newbloods to come out of hiding and serve the new King. Meanwhile, Cal, Farley, Kilorn, and Cameron try to simultaneously plan the resistance without Mare and find a way to save her from Maven.
","After Aveyard's disappointing second book, this installment is just what Red Queen fans need: genuine growth and character development, more romance, and more end game in sight for Mare Barrow. Even skeptics who put the series down after the lackluster Glass Sword should consider resuming it now that the author has once again found her groove, and her main character is no longer as excruciating to follow. Although the bulk of the book has Mare imprisoned in the Silver Palace, it's not just ll about her. Aveyard manages to couple Mare's self-reflection with glimpses of villains who are far more complex than they originally seemed. Maven was twisted and molded by his now-dead mother, whose powers allowed her to take away and insert thoughts and feelings at her will. Evangeline is revealed to be far more ambitious (and far less interested in being any man's Queen) and even slightly in awe of Mare. And then there's Cal, who still struggles with Hamlet levels of indecision with the one exception of his overpowering feelings for Mare.
At more than 500 pages, it's unsurprising that the pacing is uneven: Some parts fly by, and others feel overlong. The introduction of Newblood Cameron as a narrator has potential, but so far it hasn't been seamless; her chapters are noticeably less compelling than the other points of view. She is, however, an interesting counterpoint to Mare, and she injects some diversity (beyond the blood colors) to the story. The women in this installment (Mare, Cameron, Farley, Evangeline, and even a brief cameo by Cal's grandmother, who's reminiscent of the clever but elderly matriarch Olenna Tyrell from Game of Thrones) outshine the men. Given that the book starts with a quote from Hillary Rodham Clinton, that's clearly on purpose, and discerning readers can see how girls will eventually rule in this world.","Parents need to know that King's Cage is the third installment in Victoria Aveyard's best-selling Red Queen fantasy series. Fans of the fantasy series will know to expect scenes of supernatural and traditional combat violence (the Silvers and Newbloods all possess special powers, while the Reds use weapons), which include battle sequences where some characters control weather, others electricity, and others fire, and some simply use guns, swords, and more. There's a great deal of personal violence in this book, but the action violence is contained mostly in the last quarter of the story. The romance ramps up in this sequel, with one love story resulting in a sexual relationship, but the author keeps the passages teen-reader-appropriate. This continues to be a ""chosen one"" story, in which the lead character is destined to overthrow the status quo, but there's t least one more book left in the series.

The Chameleon Wore Chartreuse,A tale that can make a grown-up giggle too.,"In a tale that can make a grown-up giggle, Chet Gecko follows clues through school to rescue a first-grade chameleon. The lizard hero walks a tightrope between the strict sweetness of elementary school and the rich tradition of film noir and pulp detective novels.
 ","Will the opening of THE CHAMELEON WORE CHARTREUSE set PC teeth on edge? ""Some cases start rough, some cases start easy. This one started with a dame.""

With tongue firmly planted in cheek, the author slips in some hilarious lines: ""She was the kind of girl I could have fallen for. If I liked girls."" Hale paints Emerson Hicky Elementary School as a benign and comical, if bizarre, world with just enough goofy reality to make it stick, and just enough style to make it pulpy.

Teeth,"Rough language, sexual violence mar odd maritime fable.","Rudy's family has come to a remote island with the hope that a diet of magical fish will cure his younger brother's cystic fibrosis. In the local waters, he discovers a mysterious half-human/half-fish hybrid who calls himself Teeth, and the two develop a strange, emotionally loaded friendship. But when it becomes clear that the welfare of his brother and of Teeth are at terrible odds, Rudy must decide where to put his loyalty.
","TEETH has a distinctive (if extremely crude) narrative voice and an intriguing setup, but its fable-like quality is undercut by its refusal to play by the rules of logic. While perfectly willing to believe in fish/human hybrids, Rudy immediately dismisses seeking help on the island or elsewhere. With the exception of Rudy's brother Dylan, all the characters seem to operate at a level of maximum hysteria, which becomes exhausting after a while.","Parents need to know that Teeth is a contemporary fantasy novel with extremely strong language, including countless uses of ""f--k"" and ""s--t."" There's a fair amount of violence, including beatings, torture, sexual assault, and several deaths in a shootout. Rudy, the protagonist, garners some sympathy, but his language and actions are sometimes so harsh and hysterical (lots of yelling and cursing and wailing at the unfairness of it all) that they detract from the novel's theme of friendship and loyalty.

The Incredible Journey,A clever story and evocative writing.,"Two dogs and a cat trek through hundreds of miles of Canadian wilderness to rejoin their family after a caretaker misundertands her instructions and accidentally forsakes them, in this lovely, gentle, and understated tale.
 ","Kids love survival novels because they identify with the characters and feel powerful and independent right along with the protagonists; the treat here is that the characters are animals. And they act like real animals. These are not the usual talking animals in fetching outfits -- nothing in this book seem impossible for real-life cats and dogs.
The author, who knows animals intimately, conveys their wordless communication -- encouraging each other through eye contact and body language, mourning a companion who is assumed lost, or sharing the spoils of a hunt. There's plenty of action here, but like the animal's personalities, it's not over-the-top. Kids can easily imagine that they're crossing vast swaths of unpopulated land, and long stretches of quiet, forlorn beauty are punctuated by occasional terror, mishap, or joy. But readers who favor constant action over a story based on setting and mood may find the book slow going.","Parents need to know that a clever story and evocative writing will keep animal lovers and adventure fans turning the pages.

"Behemoth: Leviathan Trilogy, Book 2","Sci-fi stand-out with high adventure, great characters.","On the Leviathan air ship's approach to Istanbul, Count Volger and Prince Alek know that they need to make their escape in case anyone ever figures out Alek's secret. They're caught in the act and Volger fends off their pursuers, leaving Alek to lead his men (and a furry Darwinist stowaway) out of the Ottoman Empire and into hiding. But Alek has other ideas. He wants to help stop the Ottomans from entering World War I and joins up with a band of revolutionaries. Meanwhile, Deryn heads to the Sultan's palace with the lady boffin on a diplomatic mission that goes horribly wrong. The Germans already nearly control Istanbul, and the Leviathan will be lucky to leave the city in one hydrogen-breathing piece.
","Definitely read the first book first -- you need to, in order to follow this fast-paced, convoluted story. That sets up the Leviathan's Middle Eastern stopover full of escapes, near-misses, giant weapons, Clanker machine chases, and even a stowaway ride on the Orient Express.
The pace occasionally slows for alliances to be made and broken and secret messages to be delivered, but those moments have touches of whimsy, like when the Darwinist creature Alek adopts keeps repeating ""Mr. Sharp"" and laughing. That also makes the wait for Deryn to finally tell Alek she's really a girl a little less tiresome.","Parents need to know that this second book in the Leviathan Trilogy contains the same style of action as the first book with violence apparent (ships' crews are lost, main characters are shot at in nail-biting chase scenes) but never gory or excessive; It's actually rather mild for a young adult sci-fi adventure. Main characters are heroic and admirable and readers will learn a bit about the start of World War I -- to separate fact from science fiction see the author's Afterward.

No One Else Can Have You,"Darkly funny, very violent high school murder mystery.","In Friendship, Wisconsin, \""where no one else seemed to understand anything except how to gut a buck and go to church and be over-the-top nice without ever really bonding,\"" homecoming queen Ruth Fried and awkward Kippy Bushman have been BFFs from childhood, though Ruth's love life is starting to come between them. Then, on her way to a sleepover at Kippy's, Ruth is abducted, horribly murdered, and found the next morning in a cornfield. Ruth's mother gives her daughter's diary to Kippy so she can find some sweet eulogy material, and Kippy reads the snarky comments her popular friend makes about her. The service goes badly, and, soon after, the victim's football-hero boyfriend is jailed for her murder. Kippy doesn't like the guy, but she also doesn't think he did it; her quest to find the true killer lands her in many kinds of trouble and brings her friends in strange places.
","NO ONE ELSE CAN HAVE YOU is a bit of a kitchen-sink combo that's not for the faint of heart, but fans of gruesome absurdity (think Fargo) will love it. It mixes murder mystery, broad regional comedy, and sexed-up high school life with all the trappings of the horror genre (from gore, violence, and creepy mental hospitals to teens making ill-advised moves). Many teens will relate to Kippy's out-of-place feelings, her determination, and her creative-thinking skills as she tries to make sense of who her late friend was, whether they were really friends at all, and why she's so determined to find the killer anyway.","Parents need to know that No One Else Can Have You mixes humor, horror, sex, small-town strangeness, and teen angst in a violent but funny brew. The story opens with the grotesque murder of a teenage girl in small-town Wisconsin and frequently rehashes the gory details with gusto. As the victim's BFF tries to find the killer, she uncovers a raft of sleazy secrets the locals would rather keep buried. She also lies to her dad and other adults, burgles a house, and commits other questionable acts in her quest for the truth -- and also attracts the killer's interest. Teen and adult characters seem to be constantly having sex with one another; the murder victim was especially interested in the penis size of her various partners. Some underage drinking and drunkenness; creepy mental-hospital scenes with mind-altering drugs; abundant crude language.

Double Bass Blues,Gorgeous story of a boy's excellence and the power of music.,"In DOUBLE BASS BLUES, Nic shines as young musician with visible talent: eyes closed, head leaned into the neck of his double bass, slight smile on his lips as he plays. After his fellow orchestra members congratulate him for an ""epic solo"" during practice, he heads off, massive bass bag slung over his shoulder, for a long commute from his suburban school into the city. A threatening dog, bullies, plunking rain, whooshing windshield wipers, and other sounds and stressors might be enough to ruin any other kid's glow, but not for Nic. They all get channeled into his art t his final destination, where he finds refuge in family, and, again, music.
","This powerful book beautifully honors determination, making music, and Black boyhood. Nic's journey in Double Bass Blues is thrilling to watch unfold. As he walks, buses, and walks again to get into the city, Nic gracefully shrugs off bullies, keeps the sounds of the rain and windshield wipers in his head, and walks up stairway after stairway with that heavy bass. His arrival in the arms of his granddaddy is a long sigh of relief, and the realization that Nic is not the first musician in his bloodline to a refuge built of family, music and love.
With only about 30 words and 13 lines of dialogue, Rudy Gutierrez's stunning art does a lot of the story's heavy lifting. His swooping curved lines and sharp jagged edges evoke the different moods of Nic's journey. And the way Nic's face and hair coloring changes slightly from spread to spread captures the beauty of Blackness. This book is bursting with music, dedication, the importance of family, and Black excellence. Young readers will be able to connect on one or more levels, but this wonderful boy with his beloved bass is bound to steal the hearts of all. Don't miss this book; it's a keeper.","Parents need to know that Andrea J. Loney's Double Bass Blues, illustrated by Rudy Gutierrez, won a 2020 Caldecott Honor. It's a sparely worded, sound-heavy, boldly colored picture book that speaks volumes. Nic, a talented young double bass player has a long, rough, commute from his suburban school, where he's admired for his musicianship, back into the city, where he lives and his granddaddy waits. Nic's determination, grace, and, ultimately, joy, as expressed in the immersive art, will engage readers of all ages. Nic's classmates are racially and gender diverse, though the SUVs lined up on the road outside school suggests a lack of economic diversity. Background characters on his journey home are also a mixed crowd, while Nic, his grandfather, and the grandfather's friends are all Black. The language is very mild, with some teasing, and a bully calls Nic a ""chump."" With its expansive pictures, accessible text, and affirming messages, this is a book young kids will enjoy.

The Great and Only Barnum,"Fascinating, thorough look at the showman and his time.","P.T. Barnum was just as intriguing as the oddities and spectacles he so flamboyantly presented to 19th-century America. This biography of the larger-than-life “prince of humbugs” details the savvy young businessman’s rise to become an American legend who revolutionized museums and gave us the three-ring circus. Along the way readers will meet the little people, bearded ladies, giant elephants, and other “representatives of the wonderful” who populated his world, and get a deeper understanding of the times in which he lived.
","This skillful, nuanced biography is a feast for curious minds. In the center ring, of course, is the captivating story of Barnum himself. Candace Fleming’s engaging portrait shows this complicated man as he wished to be remembered, as he was seen by friends and detractors, and as he lived in private. This is a man who put ""human curiosities"" on display, yet paid them handsomely for the time, and who once bought and exhibited a slave yet later advocated allowing black Americans to vote. Amid the spectacle, she reveals a man with an astounding work ethic -- he rebounded from bankruptcy, devastating fires, and public disgrace -- and a love for life.
	The narrative is embroidered with plentiful extras, including profiles of people in Barnum’s life, colorful anecdotes starring Barnum, illustrations and ephemera, and even an introduction to circus lingo. Ray Fenwick’s circus-inspired illustrations and designs pull everything together in a captivating package. An annotated bibliography, a list of relevant websites, and source notes give engaged readers a wealth of further material to explore.
The thematic artwork, inspired by 19th-century designs, makes this an immersive experience.","Parents need to know that this biography pointedly but tastefully addresses P.T. Barnum’s less admirable traits, including callous treatment of his first wife, lack of interest in his children, drinking early in life, his purchase of a slave for exhibit, professional dishonesty, and exploitation of the people and animals with whom he worked. But it’s all part of a balanced portrait of a complicated man who was full of surprises -- both admirable and shameful.

"The Orphan Army: The Nightsiders, Book 1",Exciting alien-invasion thriller mixes sci-fi and magic.,"For 11-year-old Milo Silk, normal life ended when the alien Swarm invaded Earth when he was 6. Now he's plagued by cryptic dreams, his father is missing and presumed dead, and his mother is off on a dangerous mission. Meanwhile, Milo slogs through the bayous with a group of other young refugees. As he and his friends battle for their very survival, Milo realizes they may have a set of unexpected allies in THE NIGHTSIDERS, magical creatures who also fight against the Swarm.
","It's hard to find a fresh angle on the alien-invasion story, but veteran horror author Jonathan Maberry succeeds by adding an unusual supernatural element to the plot. Aimed at middle-grade readers, his new novel is fast-paced and action-packed, with a likable main character, a diverse supporting cast, and a formidable villain.
Sometimes the story feels a little out of balance, as Maberry piles on one incredible revelation after another. It's clear, however, that there will be further installments in this saga, and readers who enjoy science fiction mixed with magic will be ready and waiting for more.","Parents need to know that The Orphan Army is the first volume in a science-fiction trilogy. Set in the bayous of Louisiana after Earth has been invaded by the Dissoterin (aka the Swarm), the story follows 11-year-old Milo Silk as he struggles to save himself, his friends, and what's left of his family from merciless, insect-like extraterrestrials. Milo has strange dreams about the future, but he isn't ready at first to accept that a group of shape-shifting individuals might be able to wield magical powers and aid him in his quest for sanctuary. Milo and his friends and allies are in almost constant danger, and The Orphan Army does have its fair share of violent scenes. But the characters suffer very little permanent damage, and much of the mayhem happens off-page. A teen is shocked by a stun gun. Milo undergoes something like a near-death, out-of-body experience. A wolf attacks various members of the Swarm in aid to Milo and his crew. There's mild romantic interest between two characters.

"The Dark City: Relic Master, Book 1",Thrilling debut to fantasy series is low on violence.,"Galen is a magical scholar called a Relic Master. He and his pupil Raffi live like fugitives in the wilds of the planet Anara. If they're found by the Watch, they'll be taken in and eliminated like the rest of the disbanded Order who once followed the long-absent Makers. Instead, they are discovered by a horseman who claims one of the Makers' relics needs their attention. But this is a trap set by bandits who force them to retrieve gold from the ruined ""Dark City"" of Tasceron. Galen agrees to go, but for his own reasons. His magic was lost to him months before in an explosion. Powerful forces are said to live deep within the dangerous decimated city that may be able to help him -- and save the whole ailing planet.
","This is definitely more than fluffy filler with a cliffhanger. In an intriguing marketing idea that's intended to hook teen readers, this book is the first in a series that will be released over a very short period of time -- one book per month over the summer of 2011. Happily, the book is worthy of readers' attention with or without the special ""hook."" THE DARK CITY offers solid fantasy storytelling, keeping up a quick pace while meticulously revealing the magical world of Anara, one mysterious piece at a time. The author's thoughtful characters are also a big draw. Both sensitive Raffi and Carys, the questioning spy, make the series well worth following.","Parents need to know that this young adult fantasy novel is the first in a series of four. For a fantasy book set in a dark and dangerous world, the violence is very light, though danger always lurks and there are plenty of references past killings. Some flying animals are attacked and are shot with arrows in the Dark City, and the main characters get kidnapped. For the most part, characters are admirable, exhibiting loyalty and bravery, though the Relic Master can be a little hard on his scholar (and is called on it more than once). Also, Carys is a female character who plays a soldier and a spy with refreshingly little attention paid to her gender -- she even feels sorry for Raffi because he's not as brave as she is in dangerous situations.

I'm Glad I Did,Upbeat tale of teen songwriter has vivid '60s backdrop.,"JJ Green comes from a family of lawyers, and it's a given that she, too, will be a lawyer when she grows up. But her heart's always belonged to music, songwriting in particular. The summer after she graduates from high school, she gets her dream job in the fabled Brill Building, the mecca of pop-music songwriting in 1960s New York. While working as an unpaid intern there, she meets Dulcie Brown, a once-great singer who lost it all to drug addiction and now works as a custodian. Meanwhile, JJ also meets and writes a song with Luke, the handsome young man who works a few floors down. JJ cuts a demo of the song, with Dulcie singing, nd it could be the start of a comeback for Dulcie. But fate has other plans, and unless JJ can uncover the truth about Dulcie's past and present, their song may never see the light of day.
","In her debut novel, I'M GLAD I DID, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame songwriter Cynthia Weil vividly brings to life a world she knows well: the music business in early '60s New York City. This fascinating look back at a unique time and place serves as the backdrop to a coming-of-age story that will appeal to older teens. Heroine JJ Green is believable and teens will easily relate to her struggles against parental expectations as she forges her own path through life.
Colorful characters enliven JJ's world, nd an intriguing mystery surrounding a fallen singing star holds the reader's interest right through to the end. The writing's not quite as finely crafted as one of her many pop masterpieces and weakens considerably in the sections of Dulcie's memoir, which don't find an authentic voice and read like a high-school essay. But Weil effectively conveys the feeling of an era when America was on the cusp of tremendous social change. Teens ready to make their own futures happen, and fans of mid-century American history, will enjoy connecting to that time when anything was possible.","Parents need to know that I'm Glad I Did by Rock and Roll Hall of Fame songwriter Cynthia Weil (""On Broadway,"" ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'"") is the story of JJ,  16-year-old aspiring songwriter in early 1960s New York City. It will mostly resonate with older teens, as the protagonist tries to forge her own path in life. A major character's past drug addiction is important, and a memoir within the novel directly but briefly narrates her first time snorting cocaine. Negative consequences involving herself, her family, and her career are clearly demonstrated. Lots of adult characters drink alcohol, including one who drinks heavily when his emotions run high. Minor characters smoke frequently. JJ is a strong role model for honesty and integrity, and kids will learn about important historical events of the early '60s.

Odd One Out,"Honest, engaging tale of teen sexuality and friendship.","ODD ONE OUT is about three friends, three perspectives, one big mess. Courtney, also known as Coop, is a star basketball player with a lot going for him, including a great best friend, Jupiter Charity-Sanchez. His biggest problem is that he's been in love with her since they were little kids, and she has liked only girls for as long as he's known her. Now, instead of it being Jupe and Coop, it's Coop and some new girl named Rae. He knew it would happen some day, but he never expected anything like this. Will Jupe and Coop survive, especially when it becomes a little clear that Rae likes them both?
","Wonderfully written, funny, and real, this story is a powerful, tender, and timely look into the lives of modern American teens grappling with typical teen problems (crushes, school, fitting in). Odd One Out soars by moving beyond tired, love-triangle tropes as it examines what it means to confront the shifting labels of straight, bisexual, or gay that teens assign themselves and one another. This book covers topics of consent, respect, LGBTQ issues, acceptance, and friendship. The characters are thoughtfully developed and so relatable that readers can't help but laugh, cry, and hide in embarrassment alongside them. Odd One Out fills a hole in YA fiction and provides a wonderful way to launch discussion into themes many adults find difficult to tackle.","Parents need to know that Odd One Out, by New York Times best-selling author Nic Stone (Dear Martin), is about relationships among three teen friends -- two girls and a boy -- who have varying degrees of awareness about their sexuality. Not a stereotypical love triangle, this isn't a competition per se. The story is told from each teen's perspective as the teens figure out their feelings and what that means for each friendship, and shows teens grappling with the labels assigned to people based on who they're ttracted to.

"Firebrand: Elemental, Book 2",Dystopian fantasy displays sharper edges in second volume.,"Having saved themselves at great cost from Roanoke Island's pirates in Elemental, Thomas and his fractious crew of friends and family members, now in the pirates' commandeered ship, still need a new place to call home. Using his newfound elemental powers on the ship's radio, Thomas hears a message urging all refugees to head to Fort Sumter. But as they head south, he and his crew discover their powers fading; by the time they reach the refugee colony, they fear its distrustful, rather sinister inhabitants. Is Fort Sumter the haven they've been searching for, or have they stumbled into an even worse predicament?
","A nonstop adventure fantasy with an intriguing near-future setting, FIREBRAND mixes history and fantasy to present a fresh take on the standard tropes of apocalyptic fiction. The series' second volume is a little harsher than the first in its presentation of violence, but not excessively so. The plot offers plenty of twists, as well as a deepening sense of the characters. Author Antony John inspires confidence that he'll be able to carry this saga to its conclusion with inventiveness and skill.","Parents need to know that Firebrand, the exciting second volume of a fantasy series set in a dystopian near future in North Carolina's Outer Banks, features pirates, a colony of treacherous refugees, and a group of survivors with the power to command the elements. Beatings, gunshots, and stabbings are common, but gratuitous description is rare; one scene shows a villain being shot in the head and then eaten by rats. Three characters form an awkward romantic triangle, but there's little sexual content; in one scene, two teens spend the night together, but the details of their physical intimacy go undescribed.

The Gollywhopper Games,"Suspenseful, high-stakes contest of puzzles.","Ten children are picked out of thousands to compete in the Gollywhopper Games, a contest sponsored by a toy company, with fabulous prizes to win. But Gil has more at stake -- the year before, his father, who worked for the company, was fired and arrested, falsely accused of embezzlement. Though acquitted, he and his family are still treated like criminals, and Gil wants to get enough money for them to move out of town. But the president of the company wants to bribe him to drop out, some of the other contestants are cheating, and one of them might have information about the real criminal.
","This book is good fun. Start with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory by Roald Dahl. Make Charlie a little more dynamic, and add a backstory wherein he is trying to exonerate his father. Lose the silly humor, keep the magical factory, but change the tour to a series of puzzles and games, and you're getting close to the idea of THE GOLLYWHOPPER GAMES, which the author says was inspired by a boy who loved Dahl's classic book and wanted something else like it.
OK, it's not really much like it, but the result is exciting and suspenseful, with puzzles that are just challenging enough, and characters to root for who are appealing, if not very fleshed out. Bright middle-graders will enjoy it, including pausing to figure out the riddles before the characters do, and may get interested in solving more word puzzles and playing word games afterwards.","Parents need to know that there is nothing to be concerned about here. Some characters cheat, but are caught, and the main character is honest, even when offered bribes.

Emily's Magic Words,Basic politeness primer from famous Post family.,"Emily begins by demonstrating the magic of five particular words, what they are, and why they work. She ends by showing the three most magical words of all: I Love You!
","The message of this very basic etiquette primer is as simple as its text and illustrations. Most of us have heard this all before, and even kids new to the concept will want more from this book ... more examples, more drawings. However, having Emily pose as a magician with her powers based in her polite language is a clever touch. Looking a bit like a Joan Walsh Angland character, and probably named after the grande dame of etiquette, Emily Post, this Emily flashes her magic wand to show how certain words can make smiles appear, friends feel welcomed, and mistakes not nearly so hurtful. All in all, the lessons are good ones, though the book is a little less than satisfying.","Parents need to know that the suggestions for proper etiquette in this book are nothing new, but they're presented in a simple, friendly way that should be fun for the youngest kids who are just learning about ""magic words.""

Animalia,Kids will love this spectacular illustrated book.,"Amazing animals act out alliterative actions on each busy page in this groundbreaking alphabet zoo. Some, like horrible hairy hogs, mimic humans; others, like lions lounging in a library, are out of their element. ANIMALIA takes readers on a leisurely march through the alphabet--leisurely, because it's improbable that anyone will hurry through this spectacular oversized illustrated book.
 ","This book succeeds on several levels. First, it is an alphabet book that will sustain interest and guarantee frequent return visits. Second, it celebrates the richness of the English language, introducing vivid, vigorous verbs amid abundant adjectives and adverbs and nimble, notable nouns. Third, it further encourages language development by peppering background landscapes with loads of objects, inviting children to stab their fingers at the page and triumphantly call out each object's name.
Sesame Street long ago changed the process by which previously prim alphabet primers were packaged, but nothing prepared parents and pedagogues for the phantasmagorical pictures in Graeme Base's ANIMALIA. Creatures bask, cavort, devour, frolic, juggle, monitor, navigate, preen, queue (the author is British), slither, vocalize, yodel, and zigzag.","Parents need to know that the challenging vocabulary is well supported by vivid artwork.

A Drop of Water,Photos capture water's beauty and complexity.,"Clear, simple, spectacular. In a gorgeous combination of art and science, the beauty and complexity of water are captured in luminous photographs, cogent text, and intriguing experiments. Walter Wick examines water in its many incarnations--droplet, snowflake, steam, bubble, ice, frost, dew, cloud, and rainbow. He also provides the two essentials for scientific experimentation: inspiration and directions.
 ","What a deceptively simple title and topic! The starkness of the book reminds us that motivating kids to learn doesn't necessarily require visual bells and whistles. Simple language and glowing photographs surrounded by white space prevent readers from becoming overwhelmed by challenging scientific concepts.
Take a breath -- you can almost fall into the photographs. This is a book to be digested rather than devoured, and everything about it tells the reader, ""Go slow."" It doesn't need to be read in one sitting, either; it can be picked up and leafed through until one of the photographs inevitably grabs the reader. More vivid and detailed than what can be seen with the naked eye, the pictures are so appealing, and the experiments so easy, that most children will be eager to try them out right away, with satisfying results.","Parents need to know that they won't find any objectionable content in this book that's driven by detailed photographs of water in various states. While the writing might not engage younger readers, the amazingly detailed images have the potential to interest kids in performing simple science experiments with their parents.

The Magician's Elephant,"Magical, inspirational story perfect for reading aloud.","When an elephant busts through the roof of the opera house, crushing the legs of Madam LaVaughn in a magic trick gone awry, the whole town is abuzz, especially young Peter. He was just told by a fortuneteller that an elephant would lead him to his sister. Years earlier it was his mother's dying wish that he protect her but his guardian, the military man Vilna Lutz, insists that she didn't survive. Now he must find a way to free the elephant, which requires the help of the incarcerated magician, poor Madam LaVaughn, and a kindly neighbor policeman.
","It's the curious characters here as well as the wonderful lessons that carry this heart-felt fable to a new level. And guaranteed as the story is read aloud -- and really should be -- a different character will resonate with different members of the family. Parents will probably enjoy Bartok Whynn and his new lease on life or the singing beggar and his dog. Kids will enjoy Sister Marie and Adele and their dreams, and all animal lovers will cheer when Peter promises to help the elephant. Then there's the policeman and his kindly wife, who of course want children and can't have them. You'll even want to spend more time with the silly socialite who houses the elephant and crazy Vilna Lutz who insists on Peter eating old bread to toughen him up for military life.
But once all these lives intertwine, the story is over faster than the elephant appeared in the opera house, making THE MAGICIAN'S ELEPHANT a book that's easily enjoyed over and over.

Miss Nelson Is Back,Humorous tale of mistaken identity.,"When Miss Nelson has to have her tonsils removed, her mischievous class takes advantage of their substitute teacher, Mr. Blandsworth. It takes Miss Nelson's ultra-ego Viola Swamp to get those bratty kids back in line in this humorous tale of mistaken identity. James Marshall's witty illustrations add to the fun.
 ","One piece of ridiculousness is piled upon another, like kindling, until readers spontaneously burst into laughter. The scene where Viola Swamp, sporting a Miss Nelson mask, confounds the dimwitted Mr. Blandsworth is priceless. James Marshall gets it oh-so right with his joyously silly, expressive pen-and-wash artwork. Readers can feel the glee coming off the page when the kids realize they have pulled a fast one on Mr. Blandsworth, and the marvelous Miss Nelson is like a Buddha in her serenity and wisdom.
This story cracked up a group of 5-year-olds -- who have not yet spent a day in kindergarten -- though there was a pause in their laughter every time a new shadow appeared behind the pane of frosted glass in the classroom door.

Flush,Teens fight polluting casino boat owner in fun mystery.,"Noah and Abbey's father is in jail for sinking a casino boat that he claims has been dumping raw sewage into the waters near their home in the Florida Keys. He has no proof, the owner of the boat denies it, and everyone in town thinks he's a crackpot. Their mother is going to divorce him unless he shapes up and gets his anger and impulsive behavior under control. So it's up to Noah and Abbey to prove that their father was right. But with everyone mad at their father, hired goons guarding the refloated boat, members of local law enforcement paid off by the owner, and the owner's son beating up on Noah, getting that proof looks well-nigh impossible. That is, until Noah comes up with a plan that involves a tattooed barmaid, a stolen motorboat, and 34 bottles of fuchsia food coloring.
","Part mystery, part caper, this environmental novel has action, humor, a bit of suspense, and some interesting characters. Flush is like a Hardy Boys book with potty humor. There are holes in the plot big enough to float a casino boat through, starting with why the owner is so determined to dump his bilges, thereby polluting the beach his own son swims in, instead of pumping them into a sewer tank. It's supposedly because the owner is a cheapskate, but pumping the sewage properly would presumably cost less than his hired goons, not to mention renovating his boat and paying $10,000 in fines. Bad guys are bad guys for no apparent reason, and good guys lie, steal, and vandalize, while their hearts are in the right place.
The resolution is unlikely, and there are some whopping coincidences, but if you try not to think too hard, it rolls along nicely and there's plenty of fun to be had here.","Parents need to know that Flush is an environmental mystery by Carl Hiassen set in the Florida Keys. The ends seem to justify the means as the heroes/good guys, young and old, behave recklessly, often stupidly, and at times illegally -- all for a good cause: stopping a corrupt casino boat owner who's been dumping raw sewage into the waters near their home. There's moderate swearing and a fair amount of potty humor. A boy is beaten by bullies, threatened with a gun, and chased by a hired goon. A girl bites people hard enough to draw blood.

But when Lea dies in a car accident and she's sent to live with her aunt in Hawaii, Rumi doesn't know how to begin coping with her grief, and she's angry at her mom for abandoning her. Without music, Lea, or her mom, Rumi turns to her aunt's neighbors: Kai, the cute surfer with a laid-back attitude, and Mr. Watanabe, an 80-year-old man who's dealt with his own tragedies.

The poignant memories scattered throughout Summer Bird Blue demonstrate Rumi's deep love for her sister and the complicated relationship she shares with her mom.

"Going, Going, Gone! with the Pain and the Great One",Classic picture book revamped for new readers.,"Judy Blume's THE PAIN AND THE GREAT ONE debuted as a picture book in 1974, a classic tale about a brother and sister each convinced that their parents love the other more. The feuding siblings, now gracing a new beginner chapter book series, haven't aged a day since. Abigail (aka the Great One) is still the know-it-all third grader, lording her two years over her mischievous first-grade brother Jacob (aka the Pain). Six short chapters alternate between big sister and little brother viewpoints as they hit the county fair with their aunt, try Boogie boarding at the beach, get lost in the mall, and go canoeing in the Everglades with their grandparents. In a humorous twist, the seventh and final chapter is told by their pet cat, Fluzzy, who's annoyed about being left home alone while the family's on vacation.

The gentle humor rises from familiar kid situations (boys sticking pussy willows up their noses and calling them furry boogers) and word play (when a doctor warns the boys not to put anything in ""bodily orifices,"" the Pain wonders, ""Body offices? I started thinking about having offices inside my body. And every day tiny people would to work there."").
The appeal here is Blume's spot-on depictions of kids and their squabbles. Even adults will smile at such understatements as ""If [the Pain] fell in and got eaten by an alligator, Mom and Dad would be really mad at Grandpa Pete."" The verbal scuffling never turns physical, and the affection between the siblings is begrudging but nonetheless evident despite their best attempts to hide it. With chapters split equally between the Great One's and the Pain's perspectives, readers will likely identify more on birth order than gender. Overall, this is a funny, fast-moving pick for early readers.","Parents need to know that young readers with siblings will certainly find it easy to relate to this book's characters: Abigail and Jacob fight a lot, but they care about each other, too. The language will be familiar to parents with young kids: boys sticking pussy willows up their noses and calling them furry boogers, etc. The siblings' reactions are also spot-on: When Jacob is found after being lost in a mall, the Great One insists, ""I always knew you were okay. I mean, who'd want to steal you? You were just being a pain, same as always."" Readers might pick up on gentle lessons about not doing something just because friends do and about compromising -- but mostly they'll be laughing at the situations that these spunky siblings are constantly finding themselves in.

The Steps,"Spunky tween learns to accept her new, complicated family.","Annabel's family is complicated (and diagrammed on the original cover of the book). When she travels from New York to visit her father and his new family in Australia, she has one thought in mind -- to convince him to come back. She sees her new stepsiblings and stepmother as the ones who stole her father from her so, despite their initial friendliness, she is determined to be cool to them. But, of course, this doesn't go as planned. Her father is happy with his new family in a way that he never was before, and she finds herself liking her stepsister, Lucy. But more difficulties are on the way -- while she was gone, her mother got remarried to the father of a boy in her class.
","Author Rachel Cohn does some things well; her dialogue is natural and real, and she understands teens and their feelings. Because of this Annabel never seems like a brat, even though some of her behavior is bratty. Especially well-done is the parental reaction to the girls running away. In addition to having a police officer show them pictures of what can happen to runaways, they are given serious punishments that very much fit the crime and yet are not unduly harsh or unkind. There is a too-pat ending, but middle school girls will still feel connected with Annabel and appreciate her new perspective on family.","Parents need to know that this is a boook about a girl with divorced parents -- and a complicated family -- who wants them to get back together again. Annabel doesn't behave perfectly -- she is image obsessed and even runs away with her stepsister. But she is a realistic character who does grow into someone able to accept her new reality. There's a lot of label dropping, but this could be a good choice for tweens having to adjust to new family situations.

The Blossoming Universe of Violet Diamond,Sweet tale of biracial girl in search of lost family.,"Eleven-year-old Violet Diamond, a smart, funny kid growing up in the Seattle suburbs, is the child of two doctors. Her mom, a neonatologist, is white, as is her older sister; she's never known her dad, who died in a car accident when she was a baby, and his family has been absent from her life. When she discovers that her dad's mother, a renowned African-American artist, is having an exhibition in Seattle, she engineers a surprise meeting. Soon she's in Los Angeles for an extended visit with her grandmother, getting acquainted with her dad's side of the family, and having new experiences, ranging from going to Disneyland to attending the Holy Trinity First Baptist Missionary Temple of Los Angeles.
","THE BLOSSOMING UNIVERSE OF VIOLET DIAMOND offers appealing characters and an interesting exploration of quests for self-discovery. Some plot devices seem a bit too convenient (for example, Violet's long-estranged grandmother suddenly has a change of heart), but Violet's narrative voice is hard to resist, and author Brenda Hughes describes the sights and sounds of Southern California with the affectionate knowledge of a true local. The book's predominant message is one of love, friendship, and family ties, but along the way it delves into some subjects that may spark some discussion, from religion and prayer to the whole issue of ""race"" and what definition of yourself you're willing to settle for.
""Human race comes in many colors. This word 'biracial' is silly talk,"" says the Greek grandmother of Violet's BFF. But Violet's black grandmother says, ""In a perfect world, we are all flesh and blood, the same species, one race, the human race. But this isn't a perfect world and most people insist on holding on to the many-race concept. ... [I]n the eyes of most, even though you have a white mother, you are considered to be black.""","Parents need to know that in Brenda Woods' follow-up to Saint Louis Armstrong Beach, she tells the story of 11-year-old Violet Diamond, who has a pretty great life in the Seattle suburbs with her mom (a doctor), her older sister, and her grandparents. But Violet's dad, who died in a car accident when she was a baby, was black, and his family has been absent from her life, leaving her to feel ""like a brown leaf on a pile of white snow."" Sometimes she makes unwise decisions, as when she and her friend try to achieve her blond relatives' ""sun-kissed"" hair and turn her locks bright orange. As Violet connects with her long-lost paternal grandmother and her father's side of the family in Los Angeles, she gets a different perspective on the issue of skin color, as well as learning long-buried secrets, and arrives at the conclusion, ""I still feel like me...only more.""

Vibes,"Honest, edgy portrait of teen girl includes mature themes.","Kristi is a sophomore at an alternative high school that she hates, which isn't unusual, since she hates almost everything and everyone. Ever since her father left the family two years ago, life is not the same for Kristi. Her ex-best friend Hildie can't stand her; Gusty -- Hildie's hot brother -- thinks that Kristi is \""sick,\"" and Kristi's mom is a surgeon workaholic. Listening to opera is about the only thing that saves Kristi from her own thoughts -- as well as the thoughts of others, for Kristi is a self-prescribed psychic. For Kristi, hearing the thoughts of others just means she knows all the nasty things that people think about her. When a school project pairs her with Gusty, she must explore her own greatest attributes and liabilities and then make a plan to improve her life.
","Kristi is not an easy character to like initially. She lies, ignores responsibility, plays mean tricks on strangers, and wallows in negativity. She is, however, a complex character, and eventually reveals an honest, smart, creative, hopeful, and vulnerable side. Kristi sees and then admits her own mistakes, and has the courage to make amends in this story that moves along at a good clip.
	Kristi's psychic abilities are an interesting feature here, especially because she trusts them so much. Readers will have their doubts about how psychic she really is -- and thankfully the story is not consumed by supernatural gimmicks. It's more of an edgy portrayal of teen girl many teen girls will relate to in some way.","Parents need to know that the main character, Kristi, is angry, isolated, intentionally cruel, and lies to her mother. There is much swearing and cynicism, some adult and teen drinking and smoking (a mother offers her daughter tequila), as well as crude sexual banter, but nothing much beyond that. On a positive note, Kristi takes responsibility for her misguided behavior and begins to make amends with family and friends. There are two stable boy characters. The material is mature but has several good discussion points.

What starts as a simple trip turns into the adventure of a lifetime, giving Birdie the opportunity and awesome responsibility of reconnecting her family and saving a dying world at the same time. Will she be able to do it?
","Author Jan Bozarth has written an adventure story with a lot going for it. The characters are strong, lovable, and come with all the vunerabilities real girls have. Instead of creating a fluffy novel that concentrates on pretty fairies and magical river maidens, Bozarth imagined a fantasy world twith depth and complexity, much like the real world where our heroes Birdie and Kerka live. There is danger, wonderful twists and turns, disappointments, triumphs, and heroic fights.
Audiences will love seeing young girls in a true adventure story where they aren't relagated to damsels in distress or side kicks. There are great lessons in friendship, loyalty, and the special bonds families share, and even some botany lessons sneaked in for good measure. It appears with the Fairy Godmothers series that Bozarth seeks to show that every girl has a special talent that makes her who she is and allows her to shine. In this novel, Birdie's green thumb is the focus, and surely readers will clamor to get the next book to find out where the other fairy godmothers' talents lie.","Parents need to know that there are some scary incidents, including a girl falling from high in the air, girls being attacked by plants, and girls being chased by a large sea creature.

Her career takes her all the way to Carnegie Hall and the famous 1963 March on Washington, where she sings before Martin Luther King Jr.'s famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech, etching her place in American history. ","John Holyfield's warm and emotive acrylic paintings effectively pair with Nina Nolan's simple but elegant narration to tell a heartwarming story in a dynamic way.

How to Lead a Life of Crime,School-for-criminals mystery turns very dark and violent.,"Flick, a spoiled rich kid, is a petty thief living on the streets of Manhattan. He's a wannabe thug who drinks, swears, steals, and loves a girl named Joi. Flick thinks he can escape his demons and the pain of the death of his younger brother by living a life of crime. He believes his father's responsible for his brother's death and wants revenge. He gets his chance for it after he enters the prestigious Mandel Academy. From the outside, the school looks like an institution dedicated to training America's wealthy elite to become powerful dealmakers. But the school is not what it appears. It's actually a place for criminals just like Flick. He falls in easily with the other kids who are learning to how to lead a life of crime, but Flick discovers there's something more sinister happening at Mandel Academy. He soon puts in a plan a motion to take everyone down and uncover the truth.
","Known for her adventurous tween series Kiki Strike and her romantic teen series The Eternal Ones, Kirsten Miller ventures into darker territory with HOW TO LEAD A LIFE OF CRIME. As with her other novels, readers will will jump right into the action, and they'll root for Flick to solve the mystery behind Mandel Academy (think Hogwarts for hardened criminals) and get the bad guys responsible for causing terror within its hallowed halls. The novel also weaves the story of Peter Pan, Wendy, and the Lost Boys into the narrative by having Flick envision his dead brother as Peter Pan, and sees Joi as a stand-in for Wendy.
The first part of the book is realistic and gritty, with a thrilling mystery for Flick to solve. But toward the middle, it strays into science-fiction territory that might leave some readers scratching their heads. All in all, the novel leads readers on a roller-coaster ride of emotions and contains many surprises.","Parents need to know that How to Lead a Life of Crime is a very violent and dark book in which the teens are all criminals -- thieves, drug addicts and dealers, computer hackers, prostitutes, murderers -- or runaways. Like Lord of the Flies, it shows kids acting aggressive and violent toward others to gain control of them. The teen and adult characters all want to be the leaders and don't care about hurting other people if it benefits them. The main character, a thief, attends Mandel Academy, which represents itself as an elite school for children of the wealthy and powerful, but actually teaches kids how to be worse criminals. Teen characters are viciously beaten up, murdered, or commit suicide, and there's an attempted rape scene, a severed head shown, and strong language (including ""s--t,"" ""bulls--t,"" ""faggot,"" ""ass,"" ""dumba--,"" ""dammit,"" ""crap,"" ""goddamn,"" and ""f--k""). There's mild kissing, flirting, and allusions to sex having happened (but it's not shown).

Those Girls,"Not much to like about these shallow, mean girls.","When mysterious -- and snotty -- Stella Fox transfers into Jinx's exclusive English boarding school, most of the girls immediately dislike her. But when she starts to steal Jinx's best friend, Jinx commits to discovering her secret. Making matters worse, evil housemistress Ms. Gunn is out to get Jinx and her friends -- torturing them with liquor raids and early-morning roll call (shouted over a megaphone). Even fun-loving Jinx has to wonder: Will life in the sixth form ever be good again?
","Readers may get a kick out of some of the over-the-top characters at Jinx's exclusive boarding school. There's Ms. Gunn, the faculty's angry drunk, who invents terrible punishments for the girls but always ends up as the butt of their jokes. There are also some tender moments between Jinx and her best friend Liberty, and nice images of Jinx's weekend home life with her wacky -- but loving -- family.
But in the end, readers will be troubled by the book's stereotypical characters, such as Liberty's overprotective Saudi Arabian father, who kidnapped her from her mother as a child and now makes references to ""common prostitutes"" when he catches her doing something he doesn't like. Also, the girls seem too wrapped up in their shallow lives and small dramas to care about anything real (when a teacher is injured in class, for example, the girls laugh and stand around instead of getting her help). This is yet another clique lit book series, so there will be plenty more to learn about those girls at Stagmount. But most teen readers -- even those that like a guilty-pleasure series -- should opt for something else.","Parents need to know that the characters in this book swear like crazy, sneak off of school grounds, wear designer clothes, drink, smoke marijuana, and take Ecstasy -- and generally don't seem to care too much about anyone. The book opens with Jinx hearing her neighbor having sex, and there is some other sex talk, but the most graphic encounter is a rendezvous between two of the women on the faculty. The book features lots of stereotypes, including offensive representations of Asians, Muslims, and lesbians.

"Palace of Stone: Princess Academy, Book 2","Exciting, complex sequel a mix of politics and compassion.","Miri and her friends are guests at the palace to see Lady Britta finally married off. While they're there, she will attend the Queen's Castle for scholarly pursuits, while boyfriend Peder hones his carving skills as an apprentice. But just as Miri makes exciting new friends and joins in on wedding festivities, she learns the ""shoeless"" masses, angry over high taxes and forced payments to the king, have planned a revolt, and her new peers at school are part of the plan. As Miri becomes enchanted with city life and learning, she lso must reconcile her compassion for the commoners, her loyalty to her noble friends, new troubling questions of ethics, and her longing for family, all of which complicate the biggest question of all: Can you ever really go home again?
","Shannon Hale's PALACE OF STONE is a masterfully complex tale that subverts everything you expect from a princess adventure. Miri is a complicated, headstrong heroine, and, in every new experience she faces, Hale excels at giving readers unexpected depth. Education is not only a one-way ticket out of sheltered life on the mountain for Miri, it's a chance to study and learn about the world, help other people, light up her brain, and ultimately make things better for her community. But in the wrong hands, knowledge can be dangerous, especially if it's used by the overzealous to misrepresent the truth in the name of a good cause.
Hale teaches readers to think through all possible points of view, to view everyone compassionately, and to reconcile problems more elegantly -- to push beyond seeing issues as simply black and white. This is a terrific coming-of-age story for boys or girls that will entertain them without insulting their intelligence nd make learning look (nearly) more seductive than romance. There are some intense scenes, some assassination attempts, and threats of violence. There's also a lot of hardship and loss. But it's not treated gratuitously, and the focus here is on how young people become aware of the world and develop compassion for others. Miri and her friends grapple with romance, friendship, and grave injustices, all woven together so gracefully you'll hardly notice you've just been given a pretty sophisticated lesson in politics, ethics, and class struggle.","Parents need to know that Shannon Hale's Palace of Stone is the exciting sequel to Princess Academy. It's a beautifully woven story about the power of education, activism, compassion, and the political awakening of Miri nd her mountain friends, who learn to think for themselves, grapple with ethics, and use their power to improve the lot of their fellow man. It features some intense but not graphic violence: A man is shot but survives; a man is crushed by stone; there are multiple assassination attempts and some descriptions of executions. There are multiple stories of hunger and the loss of parents or siblings, and the plot often focuses on a poor, starving population ready to revolt.

When she's born, her grandmother predicts that \""One day this child shall hold the very heart of our family in the palm of her hand.\"" Though the family's farming life is hard, it's filled with joy as well, and Darcy is a noticer of little things, sometimes to her parents' exasperation.
But then the Irish Potato Blight begins, and the family has little to eat and no way to pay the rent. When they lose their house, they're forced to emigrate to America, leaving behind Darcy's grandparents, who are too old to make the voyage. But Darcy is about to make her grandmother's prediction come true in a most unexpected way.
Includes map and author's note.
","Sometimes it all just works. Elvira Woodruff's lyrical text, with just the hint of an Irish lilt, and Adam Rex's loving, luminous illustrations combine to lift SMALL BEAUTIES: THE JOURNEY OF DARCY HEART O'HARA -- a tale of sorrow and heartache -- into a gorgeous, moving, uplifting experience that can inspire children.
This focus on the little, seemingly insignificant things and their ultimate effect on the family (a theme illuminatingly continued in the author's note) gives the story unusual impact. How many children have their own hidden box of treasures -- stones, feathers, bits of broken things, etc? Kids who haven't spent their lives in front of a screen can relate to Darcy's openhearted embrace of her world and her collecting of meaningful objects, and will rejoice to see how much they come to mean to her family as well.","Parents need to know that sad things happen here: The family goes hungry, loses their home, and is forced to leave grandparents behind when emigrating.

Demon Dentist,"Grisly, wicked romp has touches of Dahl and dark humor.","After a terrible dental visit, Alfie has managed to avoid going to the dentist. It's been easy to hide appointment reminders from his father, an unemployed, ailing former coal miner. But a well-meaning social worker has begun to check on Alfie's impoverished home, and getting him to a dentist is her top priority. Unfortunately for Alfie, the new dentist in town is the creepy Ms. Root, who hands out toothpaste so strong it burns through stone. On top of that, children in town who leave teeth for the tooth fairy are finding grisly surprises instead of coins when they wake. Alfie and his new friend, Gabz, suspect the new dentist might have something to do with it.
","Actor David Walliams' fiendishly fun novel invites comparison to the work of Roald Dahl with its dark humor, dumb grown-ups, and squiggly art. (The latter, by Tony Ross, evokes the work of longtime Dahl collaborator Quentin Blake.) DEMON DENTIST doesn't live up to the genius of their best work, but children who enjoy their style will shiver and snicker through Walliams' wicked romp.
His witch is deliciously creepy, insisting children call her ""Mummy"" and cooing over bad teeth. Walliams makes good use, too, of running gags, such as Texting Boy, who misses all the action. But some of the humor aims uncomfortably low, particularly with Winnie: A black social worker with a heart of gold, she has a sensitive gastrointestinal system and is mocked for her size, greediness, accent, and loud style. One drawing shows her stripped to her underwear after squeezing through a too-small space. (Two other women's bottoms are played for laughs, as well, including another case of underwear exposure.) Kids will squeal, but parents may squirm.","Parents need to know that Demon Dentist is a devilishly grisly fantasy that features two terrifying dentists. (Children who are already skittish about dental exams should skip this one.) English author (and actor) David Walliams relishes the over-the-top, grisly embellishments: rusty and savage dental tools, a cat that licks blood off freshly pulled teeth, a freshly plucked pig's eyeball, still twitching. There are some sad undercurrents -- Alfie and his dying father are very poor and socially isolated -- but there's great warmth to the story, as well. Three special people in Alfie's life are affectionately attentive to his small family. The book retains a very British feel, keeping U.K. terms such as ""surgery"" for a medical office and incorporating British sweets, but American kids will catch on quickly. There's a fair amount of potty humor and cheap laughs at the expense of an overweight woman.

Gossamer,Abused kid gets otherworldly help; magical enough.,"There are dream-givers, who haunt our homes each night, collecting scraps of memories from our belongings and then bestowing them on us as dreams. There are Sinisteeds, who are former dream givers turned dark, who inflict nightmares, and sometimes attack in Hordes.
And there is an angry boy, taken from an abusive home and placed in foster care with a lonely old woman. The old woman needs the strength to help the boy, his mother needs to pull her life together to get him back, and the boy has become the focus of a Horde.

","This is an oddly magical little story from the author of Number the Stars (about the Holocaust) and  The Giver (about a dystopian society).

The juxtaposition of this sweetly reassuring part of the story with the serious abuse that the boy has endured is a bit jarring, though author Lois Lowry handles it delicately. Still, a child sensitive enough to revel in the dream-givers might need some adult explanation of how a father could do these kinds of things to his child.","Parents need to know that while nothing is described graphically, there are clear references to child abuse.

I Gotta Draw,Triumphant tale of artistic misfit and creative teacher.,"Charlie Muttnik loves to draw, and that's all he cares about doing. He draws on his spelling papers, doodles on his math problems, and draws pictures for homework assignments instead of writing words. After he gets a bad report card, his understanding teacher finds a way to help him learn as he draws.
","Without being heavy-handed, I GOTTA DRAW conveys a great message about learning differences. It also celebrates a teacher who can think outside the box and bring out the best in her students.

Mama Built a Little Nest,"Lively, poetic takes on different birds' nesting habits.","MAMA BUILT A LITTLE NEST profiles the nesting habits of a variety of birds in pithy first-person verse, ostensibly from the point of view of the baby bird. Lots of surprising facts about where birds raise their young -- on ledges, inside holes in trees, hanging off branches, burrowing underground, floating on water, etc. -- and what materials they use, from grass and twigs to spit and spiderwebs. Each spread offers a four-line poem on the left-hand page and a couple of lines or a paragraph of factual information on the right-hand one. It ends with a comforting view of a bedroom where a teddy bear's on the bed, and the last line of the poem reads: ""your nest is called a bed.""
","Each example in Mama Built a Little Nest is truly amazing and fascinating, and easy for little ones to grasp. The four-line poems are cleaver and fun while synthesizing how this nest is different from others, using words a kid can understand. For example, a baby hummingbird observes: ""Mama built a little nest,/ a cup so wee and snug/, with walls of moss and roof of sky/ and silky cobweb rug.""
Illustrator Steve Jenkins' mixed-media collages on a stark white background are spare, sharp, and clear, helping kids focus on what's distinctive about each type of bird and nest. ","Parents need to know that Jennifer Ward's Mama Built a Little Nest, illustrated by Kevin Jenkins (The Animal Book), is a fascinating nonfiction picture book that shows kids how different birds build their nests -- what materials they use and where they build them. Each bird is introduced with a clever, easy-to-understand four-line first-person poem, narrated by the baby bird in each case, complemented on the opposite page by a brief factual description of what's distinctive about how this type of bird raises its young. And dads help out, too -- like the emperor penguin, who keeps the mother's egg on his feet to keep it warm under his tummy folds for 60 days, or the cactus wren, who builds multiple dome-shaped nests on a prickly pear to attract a female. As spare and visually attractive as an Eric Carle book, Mama Built a Little Nest is  great intro to the natural world for budding science and nature lovers.

Flight #116 Is Down!,"Hardly a classic, but still a riveting adventure.","Heidi is sixteen, living on a huge estate. She can't get better than C's, can't make many friends, and doesn't think much of herself. Patrick is seventeen, from a working family, and lives to be a volunteer emergency worker.
While Heidi's parents are away, a 747 crashes into her estate. She makes her uncertain way toward the passengers, leaving her insecurities behind, simply to act. Patrick arrives first to wade through the carnage, while Darienne, a passenger, walks away unhurt.

Hundreds of workers arrive and the book follows several of them, always focusing on the three teenagers: Heidi, Patrick, and the beautiful but incredibly selfish Darienne.

Will she survive? Heidi and Patrick find unknown strengths within themselves as the suspense blazes forward.
","An entertaining melodrama, this adventure novel is a good choice for reluctant readers. It doesn't have much literary merit, but it is terrific entertainment with a good message. The characters must all let go of some ingrained ideas they have about themselves, and in giving up these falsehoods, they mature.

The Seven Days of Kwanzaa,Simple song introduces Kwanzaa to young readers.,"Following the rhythm and format of the \""Twelve Days of Christmas,\"" gifts are counted off and accumulated over the seven days of Kwanzaa.

","This pleasant little book will be fun for young readers, and gives a quick introduction to the Kwanzaa traditions. Though no instructions are given, readers will find themselves singing the words to the tune of ""The Twelve Days of Christmas"" as they turn the pages to see what each new day brings.

Golden tones and candlelight accent the kind smiles of various generations as they lovingly share the many gifts of their African-American heritage.

Otis,A humorous tale of individuality and friendship.,"A pig that doesn't like the mud? Otis prefers to stay spotless, though his family loves the mud. But Otis befriends a frog that dislikes mud as well. A humorous story, with serene illustrations, about individuality and friendship should entertain both parent and child.
 ","This gentle lesson of being oneself and being accepted is valuable for children, and kids will enjoy the twist in this story -- a pig not wanting to be messy. Otis knows that he's different, but he is determined to be himself. His brothers and sisters accept him, although he chooses not to play in the mud with them.
Watercolor-and-ink illustrations are framed in white with text overlaid on the pictures. Cartoon-like art portrays Otis and his rotund family humorously but sympathetically. The obvious joy of his fellow pigs sliding down a mud hill contrasts perfectly with the illustration of Otis, with a most unpleasant look on his face, imagining himself covered in mud.","Parents need to know that this fun story with simple writing and expressive cartoonlike illustrations conveys both family love and Otis's determination to be himself.

The King in the Window,"Busy, wild fantasy is less than lucid.","Oliver, an American boy living in Paris, is accidentally taken for the new King in the Window, the leader of the Window Wraiths. In trying to fulfill this role, he discovers that the Wraiths, who live only in windows, are in a centuries-long struggle with the evil Master of the Mirrors. At Versailles, Oliver meets the Wraiths, among them Moliere, Racine, and others from the court of Louis XIV
Aided by his skateboarding American friend, Charlie, Mrs. Pearson, a snippy but wise (well, actually witty) old British woman, and Neige, a French girl who is a crystalomancer, Oliver enters the Way, the reverse world of mirrors. There he meets Nostradamus, and discovers that the Master steals souls and intends to control all of the multiverse revealed by quantum physics. He commands an army of soul-stealers, while Charlie has only his friends, his brains, the Wraiths, a group of terrified children, and a pack of skating teens.
","With this wild tale author Adam Gopnik has fallen prey to the curse of first-time children's authors: trying to cram everything into his first book. He tosses out ideas and images with reckless abandon, a surfeit of riches that quickly becomes too much. Page after page of less-than-lucid exposition goes by, along with a plethora of references only adults will get, including Yoko's effect on the Beatles, Robert Parker's wine commentary, Moliere's sense of irony, cinema clichés, and much more.
Gopnik seems to have heard the dictum that great children's literature appeals to adults too, but mixed it up with family movies, in which adult references are thrown in to keep the accompanying adults from boredom. The result is a book that will satisfy neither. It shimmers with imagination and beautiful prose, an intellectual feast, but the editor did not do him a service by withholding the red pen.","Parents need to know that Oliver lies, skips school, and wanders around the streets of Paris at all hours, and his parents hardly seem to notice and are easily fooled.

 ","Designed to help girls navigate the transition from kid to young adult, the book employs a mostly feel-good tone. ""Move!"" ""Get a Game Plan!"" and ""Ride the Waves!"" are a few of the entry titles that signal the essentially upbeat tone of this ""collection of girl talk."" The contributors sympathize and exhort, challenge and soothe, as they examine the joys and obstacles of growing up female. Most reinforce a positive ""I'm okay, you're okay"" philosophy.
Finding the entry you want can be difficult; in many cases, actual titles of contributions, according to the subjects' biographies, are different than those given in the table of contents. Disappointingly, some of the contributor's biographies are more interesting than their entries.

Joe writes back with a story of how he's learning new words, practicing his math, drawing maps, and researching history -- all related to his favorite summertime treat, ice cream. This busy, energetic kid builds sand castles with ice cream turrets and writes a book filled with cone-inspired illustrations: cats' ears, walrus tusks, fish bodies, baseball bats, and so on. He adds and subtracts scoops, calculates number of ice cream servings, and, using the encyclopedia Grandpa gave him, researches the history of ice cream. Vibrant, lively watercolor illustrations infused with occasional sketches and tiny narrative details add facts and humor.

OCD Love Story,Unique novel about OCD teens in love is disturbing but good.,"When the lights go out during a private school mixer, Bea hears someone having a panic attack, moves near the stranger to offer comfort and ends up kissing the guy in the dark. The guy -- Beck -- and Bea end up reacquainting themselves in group therapy for teens with OCD. Only Bea doesn't feel comfortable with the diagnosis, preferring to think of her stalkerish tendencies and various safety anxieties as idiosyncracies or the result of a bad breakup. As Bea and Beck (a germaphobe and compulsive exerciser who does everything in increments of eight) start their OCD LOVE STORY, Bea secretly indulges her obsession with Sylvia and Austin, a glamorous couple she spots at her therapist's office. Bea struggles to give her heart to Beck -- the one guy who really understands her -- when she can't stop thinking about Austin.
","In her first novel for teens, author Corey Ann Haydu skillfully tackles a most uncomfortable topic. Bea isn't exactly a likable character; she's an unreliable narrator who can't see the truth for most of the story: She's extremely obsessive compulsive, and her need to check in on (eavesdrop, follow home, call, etc.) Sylvia and Austin (and her ex-boyfriend, who took out a restraining order) isn't just a quirk; it's disturbing. Readers will want to cringe as Bea's mental illness makes her (and Beck) perform certain rituals, like driving less than 30 mph and turning around and around to make sure she didn't hit anyone or anything. But thanks to Haydu's excellent writing, Bea manages to remain someone you root for and hope gets better.
Bea and Beck's relationship isn't the typical swoony literary romance. Their first ""proper"" date is tragicomically filled with OCD obstacles -- he can't stop washing his hands or tapping the table eight times, and she can't stop focusing on the pointy utensils as safety threats. Still, they make sense together, in a dysfunctional but sweet way. They understand, although they each exhibit a different form of OCD, what the other's triggers are and why they just have to do seemingly irrational things. After getting through group and exposure therapy together, Bea and Beck share a remarkable commitment to each other that's touching and intimate. In the end, although much has gone wrong for them, they -- with a lot of a help -- realize that life can and does indeed get better.","Parents need to know that OCD Love Story is realistic teen fiction that tackles an uncomfortable subject: high schoolers with OCD. An at times unnerving romance about two teens with extreme compulsions, the book includes mature descriptions of sex, lots of OCD rituals and behavior (such as stalking, constant exercising, tapping, hair pulling, and more), and a few instances of underage smoking and drinking. There's occasional strong language as well as some disturbing explanations of how to stalk someone. Despite the heavy themes, the book will make readers sympathetic to young people struggling with mental illness.

Bartholomew and the Oobleck,A joyful read-aloud with a message.,"Page boy Bartholomew is dismayed when King Derwin begins to grouse about weather's humdrum nature. To the boy's alarm, His Majesty summons the royal magicians, a shuffling, incantation-mumbling crew. The magicians boil up a pot of brew and send it out over the kingdom to rain down oobleck.
The king is thrilled with his very own brand of weather, but Bartholomew knows the oobleck is trouble. He scurries around the palace trying to sound the alarm, but everyone is incapacitated by the gluey stuff. Only after the entire kingdom is buried in green glop does the king apologize. The words \""I'm sorry\"" have a miraculous effect: The oobleck melts away, and the chastened ruler decides that the old-fashioned kinds of weather will do just fine.
","This is a satisfying (though longish) read-aloud experience for adults, especially closet comedians. And while children may be attracted to chaos, they also crave order; Dr. Seuss characters such as the Cat in the Hat and the Grinch are mesmerizing because of their power to make messes -- and speedily clean them up again.The unrhymed prose in the opening pages may lose the youngest listeners, but the royal magicians will keep them giggling until the oobleck begins to fall. This moldy troop of weirdos has some of the funniest lines (and the only rhyming ones) in the book: ""Shuffle, duffle, muzzle, muff. / Fista, wista, mista-cuff. / We are men of groans and howls, / Mystic men who eat boiled owls.""","Parents need to know that this book is chock-full of hilarious Seussian text and zany pictures to match.

The girls also learn that an evil society, The Scarlet Hand, is trying to take over the world, and they need to go through all the Grimms to do it.
","The Sisters Grimm books are full of clever devices and twists on familiar characters. One Prince Charming is a reformed alcoholic. Sleeping Beauty runs a coffee shop. Little Red Riding Hood is a psychotic kidnapper. Young readers will be entertained and fascinated to see these storybook icons in totally different roles, and each well-paced novel is more suspenseful than the last.","Parents need to know that kids love the well-realized, magical world of fractured fairy tales, and girls-against-the-world adventures author Michael Buckley creates in the Sisters Grimm series. The sister heroes of these books live in foster homes because their detective parents have disappeared, making them vulnerable to abusive guardians and members of the evil Scarlet Hand (a society that wants to take over the human and fairy tale worlds). These are very suspenseful stories, with frightening villains and lots of gore-free violence, including spear battles, bombs (a school is blown up with no one in it), and occasionally murder. One of the most frightening characters in the series is actually Little Red Riding Hood-- portrayed here as a psychotic kidnapper.

"Under the Radar (Tom Swift, Young Inventor, Book 6)",Adventure series is formulaic but satisfying.,"While Tom and his dad are hiking in a state park, Mr. Swift is kidnapped. Tom is eager to use the resources of Swift Enterprises to go after him, but the FBI agent in charge of the investigation warns him to stay out of it, and the company's head of security is arrested. Of course, none of that can stop Tom -- it just makes things a bit harder.
Using an invisibility suit he invented, his advanced computer (Q.U.I.P.), and his father's new drilling machine, Tom hunts for clues. He's joined by his sister, Sandy, and his arch-rival, Andy Foger, whose father is accused of the kidnapping. But the clues seem to be leading in an unexpected direction -- to the FBI itself.
","Though no one's definition of great literature, this book, like the others in the series, is fun, exciting, reasonably well-written, and the stuff of boyhood fantasies. The stories highlight positive values such as the benefits of brains, learning, and hard work. While adults may be contemptuous of the books' formulaic simplicity, they can be the launching pad for a lifelong love of reading -- and science.
Through four previous series, teen scientist/inventor/adventurer Tom Swift -- packaged by a syndicate under the pseudonym Victor Appleton -- has thrilled readers with his brilliance and derring-do. Tom has always been the geek's hero, combining the demeanor of a Boy Scout, the exploits of a reckless adventurer, and the soul of a scientist. In this fifth series, the stories are told for the first time in first person, and they've been updated (cell phones figure prominently, and Tom addresses the reader as ""dude""). But perhaps the most significant change is that the enemy is TRB, a terrorist group opposed to technology.

On the First Night of Chanukah,Chanukah tale borrows Christmas melody -- oy.,"A family celebrates Chanukah to the tune of \""The Twelve Days of Christmas.\""
","This slim book doesn't have much to offer by way of story or illustrations. Written clumsily to the tune of ""The Twelve Days of Christmas,"" there is little besides Chanukah clichés here. There is, of course, mention of dreidels, latkes, gelt, and the menorah, but other than a list of Chanukah-ish things, nothing happens. The pictures are merry cartoons, with every man wearing a hat or yarmulke and every kid wearing a grin.

Each poem is well crafted, and the artwork gives the book a warm feeling, much like chicken soup itself. There is a child's sensibility at work in the notions of a whale spouting chicken soup and of floating down the soupy Nile.

Sophia secretly gathers information about André 's correspondence with American General Benedict Arnold, and when she learns that Arnold intends to hand West Point over to the British, she realizes that only she can prevent this catastrophe.
","In Avi's SOPHIA'S WAR: A TALE OF THE REVOLUTION, Sophia's narrative voice and language are authentic to the times, so the writing can seem somewhat stiff and dry. Sophia spends much of the first part of the book pining over John André, the British soldier who lives in her family's home, but Sophia herself is a compelling character, and the historical events she sees and participates in make the story move quickly, especially during the climactic chapters when Sophia sets off on a journey across New York to prevent Benedict Arnold's betrayal of his country. Although Arnold may be known to young readers by name, this fictionalized account of how he conspired with the British and almost surrendered West Point to them will make this period of history come alive.","Parents need to know that Sophia's War by Newbery Award-winning author Avi is a historical novel set during the American Revolutionary War and involves Benedict Arnold's betrayal. The focus is on 12-year-old Sophia's resolve to help bring the war to a close by spying for the American side. She watches a hanging in the first chapter, a character is shot by British soldiers, and another dies due to the deplorable conditions of the British prisons. It's an absorbing novel that makes history come alive. But the old-fashioned tone of the writing may prove somewhat difficult for readers inexperienced with historical fiction.

"The Secret of the Fortune Wookiee: Origami Yoda, Book 3",Funny series continues with more folding and friendships.,"Book 3 of Tom Angleberger's Oragami Yoda series, THE SECRET OF THE FORTUNE WOOKIEE picks up where Darth Paper Strikes Back left off. Origami Yoda's creator and voice, Dwight, has begun attending a private school (Tippett Academy), where students are taught to ""understand our differences."" However, constantly being told he's ""special"" seems to have deflated Dwight's whole personality. Back at McQuarrie Middle School, narrator Tommy's girlfriend, Sara, has a ""Fortune Wookiee,"" a folded paper ""cootie catcher"" that fills in for Dwight's Origami Yoda when kids need advice. The kids wonder: Is the Force also in the Fortune Wookiee? Can they trust it? Why doesn't Dwight seem like Dwight anymore? Meanwhile, as the kids deal with the day-to-day perils of middle school, there's a serious situation brewing that will affect education at McQuarrie as they know it.
","This entry continues in the same funny, charming style of Angleberger's previous Origami Yoda books, with all of Tommy and Dwight's friends adding their stories and drawings to the ""case file."" Angleberger's characters have an entertaining, age-appropriate sense of righteousness, and the author does a hilariously great job of poking fun at Tippett Academy, where the atmosphere is so supportive of ""special"" kids that they can't really be special anymore. This volume really ups the ante with Star Wars references, for good and bad, so that kids with only a passing familiarity with the films may be a little lost at times -- but not so much that they can't still enjoy Angleberger's clever, relatable characters.","Parents need to know that The Secret of the Fortune Wookiee is the third book in Tom Angleberger's  Origami Yoda series. Like The Strange Case of Origami Yoda nd Darth Paper Strikes Back, it includes lots of Star Wars references, funny little line drawings, and middle-school humor. In this installment, Dwight, the creator of Book 1's original Origami Yoda finger puppet, has been sent to a private school, so with Origami Yoda unavailable, Dwight's friends at public school invent the Fortune Wookiee, another folded paper oracle to dispense advice and answer hard questions. The book depicts seventh graders disobeying rules at school and at home, and one minor gross-out scene. Even more than the previous two books, Fortune Wookiee indulges a serious Star Wars obsession. Overall, however, it's innocent, humorous fun, especially for kids who love the Star Wars movies.

There's a Wocket in My Pocket,This is a terrific read-aloud or primer.,"A boy lives in a house where it's commonplace to find a ZOWER enjoying a nice hot shower or a ZELF napping on a pantry shelf.

The book also has some of the prettiest color combinations of any Seuss book. One illustration combines pale yellow, blue-purple, and turquoise; another, magenta and orange accented with green. The cartoon drawings are simple yet expressive, and each creature has a personality that fits with the household item it inhabits: Since chimneys are mysterious, even dangerous places, the boy dislikes the (unseen) QUIMNEY, while the ZILLOW nestling on his pillow is cuddly and sleepy-looking.","Parents need to know that this book will have listeners calling out rhymes and chortling over witty details in the illustrations.

Ryan Higa's How to Write Good,"YouTuber's engaging memoir has solid writing advice, too.","RYAN HIGA'S HOW TO WRITE GOOD came about after one of the popular YouTuber's videos about his past (called ""Draw My Life"") generated a lot of responses from viewers and fans who had been through, or were going through, the same things Higa had been through, such as being bullied in middle school. Through graphic novel interactions with his ghostwriter, who takes him through the writing process, Higa supplies more detail about his childhood, including contemplating suicide at the age of 11. Within the framework of learning how to structure a book from the ghostwriter, Higa jumps back and forth between recounting the past and looking at it now and the valuable lessons and insights he learned along the way.
","Popular YouTuber Ryan Higa's memoir/graphic novel/how-to-write book is an honest, funny, nd sometimes moving look t how Higa overcame his bully and the trauma that lingered for years afterward. Ryan Higa's How to Write Good may inspire tweens and up in similar situations. They'll easily relate to a lot of Higa's experiences, not only of being the target of a bully but also of sometimes feeling like a loser, and they'll be comforted a little, at least knowing they're not alone.
Higa acknowledges right off the bat that he's not the most logical candidate to write a book. But he provides a clever framework for integrating conversations and lessons in writing from his ghostwriter by depicting those parts in graphic novel style, with illustrated comic panels showing him and the ghostwriter in fantasy settings. With humor, grace, and a seemingly genuine desire to help others by telling his story, Higa's book is sure to be enjoyed by his many fans. And there's plenty to enjoy and learn for those who aren't tuned in to YouTube.","Parents need to know that Ryan Higa's How to Write Good is part memoir, part graphic novel, and part how-to manual for aspiring authors. Higa is a popular YouTuber with millions of followers, so readers who find the book some other way may be interested in checking out his videos. Higa talks about how he was mercilessly bullied in middle school, how that experience led him to seriously contemplate suicide at the age of 11, and how he was able to solve the problem on his own. The bullying includes tripping, shoving, and the slurs ""chink"" and ""gay faggot."" Higa is a good role model for overcoming the trauma by carefully analyzing behavior and thinking things through to arrive at solutions to try. Readers really will learn a lot about good writing (mistakes like the one in the title are always corrected), including story structure, character development, narrative voice, and more. Strong language besides the slurs is rare but includes ""crap,"" ""bulls--t,"" and ""ass.""

Mars Evacuees,"Fun, fresh sci-fi adventure has touching message of empathy.","Earth has been battling invading Morrors since before 12-year-old Alice Dare was born. She rarely sees her mom, a famed fighter pilot, or dad, who works on subs. As the Morrors advance, she's yanked out of her British boarding school and sent to Mars with hundreds of children to train as defense fighters. Alice copes stoically -- until the few adults running Beagle Base disappear and the children, left on their own, start fighting. Alice and her friends -- smart Josephine, bold Carl, and his young brother, Noel -- set out to find help with Goldfish, a robot teacher. Along the way, they run into two very different alien species and find themselves in a unique position to change Earth's history.
","MARS EVACUEES is a successful launch for a sci-fi series by Sophia McDougall (the Romanitas trilogy). Liftoff drags a bit, but by the time the young heroes start bounding around Mars, readers will feel as if they're traveling with longtime friends. The kids bicker, naturally, but they have great respect for each other's talents -- and they all share the ability to make do with limited options and find ways to survive. Alice's narrative voice is the book's greatest strength: bright, lively, wry, and entirely believable as a 12-year-old girl navigating incredible circumstances. A comfortable mix of appealing humor, terrifying danger, and touching moments carries the story along.
The introduction of an alien way of speaking and thinking is ambitious but awkward nd may be a stumbling point for some kids. The children's relationship with the alien Thsaaa unfolds tentatively and slowly, showing the patience and work that's sometimes needed to overcome bitter divisions and find common ground.","Parents need to know that Mars Evacuees by bestselling British uthor Sophia McDougall is a wartime sci-fi story about tweens and teens conscripted into military service and sent to train on Mars as defense fighters while humans battle a multiyear alien invasion on Earth. The kids are continuously in peril, and many have lost loved ones in the war or have family in danger; dead bodies re shown. The most disturbing violence, however, is the bullying and savagery among children (some beating and threatening others) when the adults are absent. The frequency of cursing (in times of stress and aggravation, teens and tweens use ""hell,"" ""damn,"" ""Christ,"" and ""bastard"") makes this more appropriate for slightly older kids than the publisher's recommendation for age 8 and older.

"The Name of the Star: Shades of London, Book 1",Macabre modern Ripper meets hip Brit boarding school.,"Louisiana native Rory Deveaux is thrilled her parents are taking a sabbatical in Bristol, England. She enrolls in a London boarding school for her senior year and arrives ready for a true cultural exchange. She's brought her quirky hometown stories and her Cheez Whiz. Unfortunately, London has a new Jack the Ripper murderer to greet her. Someone's mimicking the notorious 1888 murders, and her fabulous new school is right in the middle of the action. In fact, the night of one murder, she's the only one who sees someone creepy and suspicious. With one Ripper-style murder to go, it doesn't take long for the police to realize Rory's in real danger.
","Here's a page-turner ideal for fans of Cassandra Clare (good call quoting her praise on the paperback's cover) and her witty and bloody Mortal Instruments series. This modern-day Ripper story has plenty of mystery, suspense, gory details, and a good dose of historical perspective. Unexpected is the boarding school setting, the hip and funny teen characters, and the strong paranormal vibe. All squeezed together, THE NAME OF THE STAR is creepy, exciting fun.    	Missing is a bit more depth to the paranormal angle -- those secret police devices could use some work. It's the only weak spot in an otherwise fantastic genre mashup.","Parents need to know that The Name of the Star is the first book in the Shades of London series and talks extensively of the Jack the Ripper murders of 1888 as they are recreated in modern London. Details of crime scenes are given -- and they're gory with organs rearranged -- but only once is the crime somewhat replayed. Rory, the main character, has seen the modern-day murderer and is in constant danger. She's cut and those protecting her are injured seriously as well. There's lots of talk of near-death experiences, including a drunk driving accident. Language is light and so is the sexual content (just lots of kissing), while drinking is a bit heavier; it's legal in England at 18 and most students are 17 and 18, but they stockpile booze in their rooms and drink to excess. Readers will learn a lot about English history and boarding school life.

"Leven Thumps and the Gateway to Foo (Leven Thumps, Book 1)",Occasionally fun but too long and poorly written.,"Orphaned, mistreated Leven is contacted by a tiny creature named Clover, who informs him that he has a destiny to save two worlds: his own, and the world of dreams, called Foo. As he discovers he has the ability to see and alter the future, he meets a girl who can turn anything into ice. Together with Clover and a toothpick who was once the king of Foo, they race to destroy the gateway to Foo, pursued by the shadow minions of Sabine, who rules Foo and wants to extend his dominion over the real world. Includes map, annotated character list, and glossary.
","This book, which reads like it was written by a gifted 12-year-old, was published in its bloated, badly written, and typo-laden state by a publisher who perhaps once knew better. There was a time when editors were gimlet-eyed, erudite types who wielded a red pen like Excalibur, and had stables full of warrior monk copy editors who thought nothing of waterboarding a semi-colon until it admitted it was really a colon. Apparently those days are over, giving way to the era of the Corporate Publisher. ""There's this book,"" they must have said. ""from some little-known publisher in Utah that's selling up a storm. Buy it, and distribute it nationally.""
""But,"" one hopes at least one voice in the room piped up, ""it's bloated, badly written, and full of typos. At least let one of our editors work it over.""
""Nah. Publish it as is. It's selling just fine.""
And so the deed was done. After more than 200 pages of maundering around the neighborhood in Oklahoma, the story finally gets going, though the characters don't make it to the absurdly named Foo until nearly the end of the book. Along the way there are some flashes of excitement; no character development; a plot that, when it's not being completely derivative, doesn't make much sense; plenty of clichés; and numerous instances of the author amusing himself by throwing in weirdly inappropriate references that few kids will get, to everything from '70s pop music to Seinfeld. The movie version is due out in 2009.","Parents need to know that there is some mild fantasy violence here: attacks by several monsters, one of which is lured off a cliff to its death.

Defy the Stars,Sci-fi space thriller is a thought-provoking page-turner.,"DEFY THE STARS is set in the distant future, and Earth is nearly uninhabitable while colonies of humans have settled on other planets, like the environmentally pristine Genesis, where humans fight off invasion from Earth's robot army. Noemi Vidal is an orphaned teen soldier in the Genesis army. During a recon space mission, Noemi winds up on abandoned spaceship, where she encounters Abel, a mech unlike any of the 25 others she's read about -- one with the capabilities of all the others put together. Abel, who was created by Earth's foremost AI inventor, had been stuck on the ship for 30 years, and after dealing with Noemi he realizes his programming requires him to obey her as his new commander. They're tentative and unsure of each other, and Noemi can command that Abel help her on a Genesis mission -- even if the mission will destroy him. But as their time together proves more and more dangerous, Noemi recognizes Abel is more human than she'd like to admit, and Abel discovers new feelings he can't quite classify.
","Riveting, relevant, and surprisingly romantic, this sci-fi space adventure switches perspectives between a young female soldier and a human-like AI who team up for a dangerous mission. Author Claudia Gray is adept at sci-fi and romance, and she continues to merge the usually incongruous genres well in this opposites-attract, slow-burning love story that unfolds as a tale of escape, adventure, and self-discovery. Gray also explores issues of faith and discrimination. Noemi, like all Genesis-born, has been raised to believe ""mechs"" (AI) are soulless abominations used by amoral Earthlings, but Abel is alternately snarky, smug, arrogant, funny, truthful, and kind. Noemi and Abel's banter is sarcastic and humorous, even as Abel's primary directive is to follow her orders. So he makes her rethink her stance on AI and whether he's more human or machine, while she makes him rethink his programming and feel.
Gray laudably manages to make Defy the Stars diverse -- Noemi is of Latino and Polynesian descent, Abel is white and speaks with a faint British accent like his maker, and supporting characters range in race, ethnicity, and religion. Noemi is a particularly multifaceted character; it's easy to see what Abel finds remarkable in her. And Abel may look perfect, but looks aren't dwelled upon, since Noemi (and all Genesis residents) are described like a mash-up of Veronica Roth's Abnegation and Dauntless: self-sacrificing, faithful, and slightly puritanical but also brave and ready to defend their homeland at all costs. Noemi and Abel's story is so compelling, readers will be eager to find out what happens in the next installment. ","Parents need to know that Defy the Stars is a dual-narrative sci-fi adventure following Noemi, a young teen soldier from the Genesis space colony, and Abel, an advanced AI who's nearly indistinguishable from humans. The space thriller doesn't skim over violence; it includes an upsetting death and many close calls. The protagonists are under near-constant threat, whether from the authorities, artificial intelligence security ""mechs,"" or the dangerous elements of space travel. Because Abel doesn't age, he appears around 18 or 19 but has ""lived"" for more than 30 years and occasionally says scandalous things (like proposing he prostitute himself as a means of quickly acquiring funds or having sex to relieve Noemi's stress and tension) in a matter-of-fact way. There's a blossoming romance between Noemi and Abel, but it's slow-burning and doesn't move beyond kissing.

One day a lost little furball shows up at their home, and tensions between Flurry and Winter escalate quickly. When Winter sets off on an adventure to find and bring home her lost friend, she calls on her three sisters to face the dangers ahead. Will she find Flurry in time to make things right?
","The second in the Enchanted Sisters series, this is a stronger tale than the first installment, exploring the friendship dynamic between a girl and her polar bear. Authors Elise Allen and Halle Stanford do a wonderful job keeping the adventure interesting, with great pacing and surprises along the way.
The same gender issue that ppeared in Book 1 is present in Book 2: The girls are largely sweet, well-mannered, and well taken care of, whereas the boys represent all that's not so great in the world, with poor table manners and cruelty to animals. But now there's a juxtaposition of the resources between the genders: self-cleaning, self-healing homes for the girls and standard homes for the boys that are layered in dirt, discarded food, and broken items.

Capt. Hook: The Adventures of a Notorious Youth,Exciting but violent -- not for sensitive kids.,"James, the illegitimate son of a British lord, is sent to school at Eton. Subjected there to the institutionalized violent hazing that was peculiar to the schools for the British elite, he fights back in surprising ways that turn the school on its head and make him the hero of the underclassmen. Adept at sword-fighting and training poisonous spiders, and with an indomitable will coupled with a fierce intellect, he is soon called King Jas., and has made deadly enemies of the Eton Bloods, especially one Arthur Darling. His one friend is Roger Peter Davies, soon dubbed Jolly Roger. Together they embark on a series of triumphs and mad exploits, including dueling, kidnapping a sultana, stealing a ship, and assorted mayhem, that eventually gets them expelled from the school, whereupon they sign up on a sailing ship owned by James's father, only to discover that it is a slaver.
","Hart, screenwriter of the movie Hook, has outdone himself in creating a fascinating hero/villain who is as magnetic to the reader as he is to his schoolmates. Hart uses as a springboard an obscure short story by J. M. Barrie, combining it with hints laced throughout Peter Pan to create a thrilling story that fleshes out the evil pirate captain's early life. Barrie always saw Hook as an intriguing, tragic figure, and a reflection of himself.
Hart's dark and violent conception of Hook is truer to Barrie's original vision than it is to the humorously foppish popinjay caricature Americans have come to know, thanks to Disney and Cyril Ritchard. In the original 1904 stage play, Hook was so terrifying that children often had to be carried out of the theater screaming. It takes more to shock the worldly kids of today, brought up on violent movies and video games. But no one can accuse Hart of not trying. And sensitive kids may still need a guiding hook, er, hand.","Parents need to know that this story is about the making of a classic literary villain, so he behaves badly a lot of the time -- but because he's the hero, and meant to be sympathetic, his behavior becomes appealing. The brutality can be disturbing: human carcasses on a plague ship, whipping and beating, poisonous spider bites, swordplay and fighting, a brutal game with lots of injuries, mistreated and tormented slaves, a sailor killed with a hook. This also isn't for reluctant readers: Overflowing with British, specifically Etonian, slang, Latin names, and old-fashioned heroic repartee, it will be heavy going for some, who may need help to decipher it.

He draws an apple tree, and a dragon to guard it, and so on, creating settings, situations (a picnic full of pies), and transportation (a boat, a hot air balloon) as the need or whim arises. He draws windows, hoping to find his own window. Then he finally remembers his own window \""is always right around the moon.\"" So he draws a window around the moon above him, then draws his bed, hops in, draws up the covers, drops the crayon and drops off to sleep.
","HAROLD AND THE PURPLE CRAYON is a timeless story that has been a hit with young readers since it was first published in 1955. It's simple enough to delight a toddler and clever enough for parents to enjoy as a whimsical celebration of endless, spontaneous creativity.

Cinderella Liberator,"Fresh take on classic tale boosts being true, free self.","As CINDERELLA LIBERATOR begins, our main character is shown mopping the floor, doing the laundry, and ironing the clothes, and we learn she's sometimes tired and lonely but she's also strong, capable, and a good cook and baker. When her stepsisters get an invitation for Prince Nevermind to go to his ball, Pearlita tries to give herself the highest hair-do, because ""surely, having the tallest hair in the world would make you the most beautiful woman, and being the most beautiful woman in the world would make you the happiest."" Her sister, Paloma, puts as many bows as possible on her dress, thinking, ""having the fanciest dress in he world would make you the the most beautiful woman, and being the most beautiful woman in the world would make you the happiest."" They go off to the ball, and, as usual, a fairy godmother appears, transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, mice into horses, a rat into a coachwoman, and lizards into footwomen, and waves her wand to change Cinderella's dress into a ball gown and give her glass slippers. She goes to the ball, dances with the prince, and when he asks who she is, she runs away, leaving one glass slipper behind. When the prince goes house to house in the village to find the girl the slipper belongs to, he finds perfect-fit Cinderella. Then comes a new backstory about her father (a great judge) and mother (a ship captain), who are both still living, and we find  out the prince has dreams of his own. He and Cinderella become friends and pursue their separate paths -- hers to open a bake shop, his to have a farm. Even the stepsisters' dreams come true: Peralita opens a hair salon, and Paloma becomes a seamstress in a dress shop. ","This feminist tweaking of the Cinderella story manages to be richly entertaining while promoting positive values of being free to follow your own passion in life. The narration has a warm tone, with sly asides. For example, pointing out the flaw in the stepsisters' belief that ""being the most beautiful would make you the happiest,"" the narrator notes, ""They weren't happy, because they were worried that someone might have higher hair or more bows than they did. Usually someone does.""
Cinderella Liberator chucks the goal of snagging a prince for a husband and stresses the importance of being your true self. The fairy godmother gives all the transformed creatures a choice after the ball to return to their old selves or stay in their new bodies, be it horse or human. The lizards decide to turn back into lizards, not wanting to lose the ability to ""run up walls and lie in the sun on warm days."" The fairy godmother tells Cinderella that ""true magic is to help each thing become its best and most free self."" And who wants to argue with a fairy godmother? ","Parents need to know that Cinderella Liberator, by award-winning adult author and essayist Rebecca Solnit, re-imagines the classic Cinderella story to be about a kind, independent person who's not angling to be a prince's wife. She wants freedom from her household drudgery, but she also wants to make her own way as a baker. And she's happy to be just friends with the prince and help him follow his dream to be a farmer rather than spend all his time in a palace doing nothing. It's a fresh, modern version that promotes positive values, and even the two stepsisters find their own true paths. The striking silhouette illustrations by Arthur Rackham, which originally appeared in a 1919 edition of Cinderella, dd a classic feel to this bold new interpretation. And since they are all-black images with no skin tones presented, readers of all backgrounds can relate to the story and characters.

For one thing, Great-Aunt Juniper, who guards the magic urn of Book 1, has disappeared. For another, a beautiful girl in Greek sandals kisses geeky Tyler at a Magic: The Gathering tournament. Also, a bizarre bank robbery closely resembles the crimes of Book 1's villains, who are supposed to be in jail. Between the fear of world-destroying weapons falling into the wrong hands and the excitement of their mysterious new companion, Tyler is soon persuaded to take the wheel for another perilous road trip, and the plot thickens when Jax starts getting emails from someone claiming to be her long-lost father.
","Even reluctant readers will be avidly turning the pages en route to a cliffhanger ending that sets up the finale. It appears that the kids may finally have gotten themselves into something they can't get themselves out of! Wisecracking, determined Jax and shy, sickly Ethan take turns telling the story, with occasional interludes from older brother and successful teen game developer Tyler; they're all very appealing and relatable as they try to solve the secret cipher, avert cosmic mayhem, and grapple with such real-life challenges as the fact that although Tyler and Ethan's family has plenty of money, Jax's single mom doesn't -- and Jax's father is in prison.  Parents who aren't sure their kids are mature enough to keep the story's larceny, lying, and other peccadilloes in perspective may wish to discuss the issues with them.","Parents need to know that The Secret Cipher, second volume of the planned Secret Box trilogy, finds cousins Jaqueline (Jax), 12, Ethan, 13, and Tyler, 17, embroiled in more hair-raising adventures. In the process they lie to their parents, run up the parental credit cards, tell assorted whoppers to adults including nuns and prison guards, and burglarize a museum -- but it's all for a good cause, as they have to save the world from a villain bent on enslaving the world with magic from Greek mythology. Their adventures take them to a nursing home, a prison, a comics convention, and historic sites of Boston. Along the way, there are a few ""butt"" references and some bathroom humor.

Gym Candy,Authentic look at high school football culture and drug use.,"Mick's passion has been football since he was a little kid. His father, a former professional football player, has a room with walls dedicated to his high school and college career, and Mick wants to be just like him. He'll do anything to get and keep an edge. When Mick earns a top spot on the varsity football team, he looks to a friendly personal trainer's solution to his problem. Soon Mick finds himself in over his head. Can he ever get back to playing the game fair or will the ""gym candy"" keep him coming back for more?
","GYM CANDY is a novel for real football fans. Author Carl Deuker does a fantastic job capturing the action from the first down to the final touchdown. The audience will almost be able to smell the sweat and feel the hits through Deuker's vivid writing. Teens will cheer on Mick as he goes after football glory with all that he has in him. 
 The novel will give both teens and their parents some serious issues to think about as Mick succumbs to both internal and external pressure to perform like an athlete far beyond his years. If readers are looking for an uplifting, sports hero ending, they'll be disappointed. A bit of a downer, the ending is as raw and real as the rest of the novel. ","Parents need to know that there are some heavy subjects in this novel, including teen steroid use, suicide, and violence related to drug use. A teen threatens to shoot a friend before turning the gun on himself. Adults take advantage of impressionable teens, putting one on an illegal steroid routine.

"Wintersmith: Tiffany Aching Adventures, Book 3",Fantasy's sensible witch entices Winter.,"When taken by her mentor witch to see the Dance of the Seasons, Tiffany accidentally attracts the attention of the Wintersmith, the elemental spirit of Winter, who develops a crush on her. To win her love he makes all the snowflakes (as well as some icebergs) look like her, writes her name in window frost, and creates a garden of ice-roses for her. But most of all he tries to make himself human by following the directions in a nursery rhyme.
Meanwhile the spirit of Summer is none too thrilled, and Tiffany also has to deal with the smothering protectiveness of the Feegles; Roland, who may or may not be her boyfriend; the death of her current mentor; and helping the snippy Annagramma in spite of herself.
","Sensible witch-in-training Tiffany and the crotchety witches she learns from certainly are appealing characters in this third installment of the Tiffany Aching Adventures. But the book really comes to life when the Feegles are onstage -- which is too seldom. The red-haired, blue-tattooed, drinking, stealing, and fighting Wee Free Men with the thick brogues are the main source of fun and humor.
Author Terry Pratchett continues to have plenty to say on a variety of subjects, including marriage, old age, the nature of myths and stories, and growing up, and he does so with a dry, twisty wit that often makes readers stop and think -- after they finish laughing. The plot is often secondary to Pratchett's pungent observations, and he subtly goes several layers deeper than you'd expect.","Parents need to know that, as fantasies go, this one is pretty mild. It contains minimal violence and displays solid values of hard work and responsibility.

The Poet's Dog,Talking dog helps stranded kids in gentle book about grief.,"THE POET'S DOG is narrated by a dog, Teddy, whose owner, Sylvan, was a poet and writing teacher who died a few days before the story starts. Teddy's now in their cabin alone, fed by Sylvan's favorite writing student. But when a severe winter storm hits, snowing in the roads, Teddy ventures out and finds two kids, a brother and sister, stranded in the storm nd leads them back to the safety of the cabin. There, they spend a few days stoking fires and cooking meals concocted from canned goods in the pantry, and Teddy gets to know the two kids as they wait for the storm to end and help to arrive. He also reminisces about his life with Sylvan. Will the kids' parents come to get them? And will Teddy find a new home? ","This book is a spare, moving story about love and loss written by a masterful author of beloved children's classics. Though the main characters are a talking dog and two kids, The Poet's Dog is tinged with the feel of an older person looking back wistfully on life, so it might best be appreciated by sensitive kids who themselves have poetic souls. Sections in italics recount Teddy's life with Sylvan and the writing sessions Sylvan had with his students, including some simple poems that add meaning to the story. There's not a lot of text, but what's there is filled with gems and polished detail. For instance, ""The students who want to be poets are eager and fresh, like washed apples."" Before he passed, Sylvan taught Teddy the meaning of the word ""poignant,"" and sensitive young readers will find this book to be an excellent example.","Parents need to know that The Poet's Dog is a slim novel by award-winner Patricia MacLachlan (Sarah, Plain and Tall) written in her signature spare, poetic prose. This one deals with loss nd has a fantasy element:  talking dog. The loss is the recent death of the dog's owner, an older poet, and the dog reminisces about their happy life together. There's some talk of the illness and death, though that's handled gently, without a lot of graphic detail. That story's embedded in another, more immediate story in which the dog sets out to rescue two children stranded in a severe winter storm. The children can understand him when he talks, just like the poet could, and everyone in this book writes poetry or writes in their journals to express their tender feelings.

Marta! Big & Small,"Cute bilingual tale of animals, opposites, and clever girl.","MARTA! BIG & SMALL is the story of an ""ordinary girl"" named Marta. Marta knows that she's bigger than a bug, smaller than an elephant, and faster than a turtle. When Marta meets a snake who thinks she's ""sabrosa"" or ""tasty, very tasty,"" she must outsmart him. Marta brilliantly gets away because she is ""ingeniosa"" or ""clever, very clever."" The big lesson here is that Marta's identity isn't defined by one single characteristic -- big or small, fast or slow. The way we see ourselves is a matter of perception. Although Marta may think she's just an ""ordinary girl"" at the beginning of the story, by the end she proves to be quite extraordinary!
","This lively story of animals and opposites is a fun way to learn Spanish vocabulary. Although the text in Marta! Big & Small is minimal, author Jen Arena does a great job introducing Spanish words within the context of the story. Her use of repetition and context clues make the meaning of each new Spanish word very clear. For example, ""To a horse, Marta is lenta. Slow, very slow. To a turtle, Marta is rápida. Fast, very fast.""
Vibrant artwork by Pura Belpré Honor recipient Angela Dominguez further focuses the reader's attention on making comparisons between Marta and the different animals she encounters. Large, vivid illustrations on a white background offer little or no background distractions nd help the readers see the similarities and differences between the main characters in the story.","Parents need to know that Marta! Big & Small, by Jen Arena and beautifully illustrated by Angela Dominguez, is about a curious little girl name Marta. At a quick glance, you may think the book is just about animals, opposites, and learning new words in Spanish. But there's subtle evidence of Marta's cleverness, and  fun twist in one tense interaction she has with an animal that can be empowering to little girls nd kids in general. New Spanish words are presented within the context of the story: ""Marta is lenta. Slow, very slow."" A Spanish-English glossary at the end of the book reinforces vocabulary words and introduces new ones by listing the Spanish names for the animals featured in the story.

When Santa Fell to Earth,"Santa fights commercialization, kids help, ho hum.","While flying through the sky in his gypsy caravan during a thunderstorm a couple of weeks before Christmas, Niklas Goodfellow finds himself crashing to earth when his reindeer, Twinklestar, bolts in fear. The caravan ends up on the side of a suburban street, where Niklas and his accompanying angels and elves meet Ben (and later Charlotte).
Niklas explains that the North Pole has been taken over by Gerold Geronimus Goblynch, who is only interested in money and who has brought in modern technology, outsourced the toymaking, turned the Santas into chocolate and the reindeer into salami, employed giant nutcrackers as enforcers, and driven out the elves. Niklas himself is the last real Santa. Now it is, of course, up to the children to help him take Christmas back.
","Christmas taken over by greedy corporate interests is not a new theme; the only thing new that Funke brings to this hackneyed, trite tale is a complete lack of logic. Main character Ben is sort of bullied, of course -- but not really. His parents are rather unfeeling -- until they suddenly become warm and caring.
Bright children will have guessed the whole story by page 37, and the way it unfolds isn't particularly exciting. Funke's name has become a famous brand, and so this book will certainly sell. But it's a disappointment.","Parents need to know that the author has a very strange approach to Santa Claus, and younger children may find it disturbing to their belief system.

A Very Large Expanse of Sea,Muslim teen busts stereotypes in bitterly funny school tale.,"It's 2002, and 16-year-old Muslim teen Shirin's planning to get through the school year the same way she's gotten through school for years, by not engaging with anybody -- but A VERY LARGE EXPANSE OF SEA, in the form of Ocean, her lab partner, intervenes. Thanks to her striving, upwardly mobile parents, who fled Iran for the United States and never stop working, she's in a new town and a new school every year anyway, so it's not like there's any point making friends. In the wake of an incident at her last school, when 9/11-inflamed hooligans threw her to the ground and tried to rip her hijab from her head, only to go free when a cop essentially said she asked for it, not engaging seems like a really good plan. But then her brother Navid, the popular one, recruits her for a breakdancing team. And she and Ocean fall in love, leading to many misunderstandings between them and a lot of hostility from others.
","As she herself suggests, this heartfelt, poignant, bitterly funny tale of a foul-mouthed Muslim teen trying to survive post-9/11 high school is the book Tahereh Mafi's been trying to write all along. Confronted with A Very Large Expanse of Sea, i.e. her lab partner and unexpected love interest Ocean, narrator Shirin learns quite a bit about overcoming some of her own prejudices as well as surviving those of others. In the process we learn a lot about Muslim daily life and culture -- and what it means to different people. In addition to a lot of crude language, there are many life lessons and unexpected sweet moments, as well as a growing sense of empathy with troubles other than your own.
""People had been s---ting on me for having the wrong name/race/religion and socioeconomic status since as far back as I could remember, but my life had been so easy in comparison to my parents' own upbringing that they genuinely couldn't understand why I didn't wake up singing every morning. ... When I was a kid and would tell my mom that people at school were mean to me, she'd pat me on the head and tell me stories about how she'd lived through war and an actual revolution, and when she was fifteen someone cracked open her skull in the middle of the street while her best friend was gutted like a fish so hey, why don't you just eat your Cheerios and walk it off, you ungrateful American child.""","Parents need to know that A Very Large Expanse of Sea, by Iranian American author Tahereh Mafi (Whichwood), is a fiery, relatable, quasi-autobiographical novel of being a post-9/11 Muslim high school sophomore. Main character Shirin wears a hijab, swears like a sailor, loves breakdancing -- and against all odds, falls in love with the most popular, good-looking basketball player in her sports-crazy school. His name is Ocean (hence the title), and he feels the same about her. There's quite a bit about the harmful effects of prejudice and stereotyping -- and how to overcome your own bias and see things as someone else does, which forms a positive contrast to the barrage of hateful or clueless behavior from many teens and adults. There's lots about the experience of growing up as the child of refugee immigrants and the struggle to be and be seen as yourself without all the baggage others put on you. Frequent strong language includes ""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""d--k,"" ""goddamn,"" ""Jesus Christ!"" and more. There are numerous make-out sessions nd sexual banter. Shirin and other Muslim kids suffer constant prejudice, bigotry, and threats of violence. Bullies attack her in freshman year, knock her down, and try to rip the hijab from her head.

The Fire-Eaters,The beautiful and the bizarre coexist here.,"There's a lot going on in Bobby Burns's life. His father is ill, perhaps seriously, he is just starting at an abusive school, he has come to care for a mentally ill fire-eater, and the Cuban Missile Crisis is beginning.
His lower-class life on the coaly shore of Keely Bay in England can be a hard one, where boys are expected to be tough and outsiders are viewed with suspicion and hostility. But it has its moments of beauty and wonder as well, and he wouldn't give it up for anything. But between his father going for tests in the hospital, and the Americans and Russians getting ready to annihilate each other and the rest of the world, he worries that it may be taken away anyway.
","This is a lovely and satisfying book, though as with some of Almond's other novels, the beautiful and the bizarre coexist here. Some of the fire-eater's insane antics are disturbing, and the treatment of the students at Bobby's new school is certainly abusive by modern standards. But abusers get their comeuppance, the insane find peace, and the harsh and tough discover their hearts. Miracles happen, none greater than the Americans and Russians stepping back from the brink.
David Almond is certainly unique among children's authors (and perhaps adult as well). His books tend to be short on story and long on setting, atmosphere, and flights of lyricism and romantic vision so stunning that they bring a lump to the throat, and so poetic that they far outshine books actually written as poetry.","Parents need to know that a scene where a fire-eater pushes a skewer through his cheeks may be too intense for some readers.

Hey Grandude!,Grandfather takes kids to far-away places in magical romp.,"In HEY GRANDUDE!, a white-ponytailed grandfather finds his four grandkids bored and grumpy when they're stuck inside on a rainy day, so he whips out some postcards and his magic compass nd whisks the ""Chillers"" way to three different places on the cards, each time invoking the chant, ""See the compass needle spin,/ let the magic fun begin!"" They go first to a tropical beach, where they get chased by pinching by crabs; then to a desert with cowboys and horses, where they get charged by buffalo; nd then to a mountain meadow with wildflowers and snow-capped peaks, where they must escape n avalanche -- by jumping on a flying cow. Finally, they get transported back to their bunk beds, safe and sound.
","This rollicking fantasy-adventure tale uses a touch of magic to transport four kids and their Grandude to destinations out of their everyday experience. Author Paul McCartney infuses Hey Grandude! with humor, love, lively word choices, and wordplay. When they're threatened by a buffalo stampede, one of the Chillers says, ""Hey Grandude, could we go somewhere a little less ..."" ""Stampy!"" Grandude says, finishing the boy's thought. Little kids will love chiming in on the magical phrase that activates the compass each time. They'll also enjoy the repetition of the phrase ""Zing, bang, sizzle,"" that accompanies each scene change.
Artist Kathryn Durst's accessible, cartoon-like illustrations keep up the suspense and momentum as the action-packed story zooms to its peaceful bedtime conclusion.
 ","Parents need to know that Hey Grandude! is a fun, action-packed picture book by musician and songwriter Paul McCartney, known as a member of The Beatles and his other bands since.

Miles to Go,"Miley shares her life ""so far."" Fluffy, but fun for fans.","Miley Cyrus may be the star of a hit movie and television series (and daughter of country singer/actor Billy Ray Cyrus), but she still worries about acne, hates sixth-grade bullies, and drinks Ovaltine with her dad in the morning. In this autobiography, complete with two color-picture sections, Cyrus offers a backstage peek into her TV show, concerts, and family life. With short, conversational asides in the margins (""I know! Who wants normal teen angst?"") and various lists (""7 things I'd like to change about myself""), the book will make Miley seem even more like a friend and role model to Hannah Montana's tween fans.
","Adults may roll their eyes at MILES TO GO's trite attempts at inspiration, but Miley's willingness to expose her insecurities will resonate with her young fans. Despite a narrative that jumps around in time and focus, fans will love the personal details (she skips Elton John's and Madonna's post-Oscar parties to eat pizza with her mom, in pajamas).
Miley touches on how media criticism (of such things as her cuddly relationship with her dad, and, ridiculously, her large ankles) hurts her feelings, but she doesn't mention the Vanity Fair photo controversy. Miles to Go is at its best when Miley's rural Southern roots (""there's nothing more relaxing than to kick back and watch chickens be chickens"") and sense of humor (""when I look back on my life, the only theme that I see starting to emerge is wigs"") show the girl behind the star.","Parents need to know this is the sweet Hannah Montana side of Miley Cyrus, not the controversial one that pops up in sexy photos. This isn't a dishy celebrity tell-all. Cyrus and her co-author keep her young fans in mind, with many ""I'm just like you"" stories and inspirational passages. The book encourages readers to see Cyrus as role model; she shares her Christian values and Biblical passages.

A Child's Calendar,Traditional pastimes are linked to the 12 months.,"Come along for a feel-good romp! Traditional, family-oriented pastimes are linked to the twelve months of the year, as a multiracial cast frolics together. A child's lyrical voice tells the tale, and natural-hued illustrations sparkle with action. Simple but descriptive metaphors enrich the reader's vocabulary and imagination, making this a good book for both parents and children.
 ","This gentle story won't have children howling with laughter, but exclamation-marked sentences, repetitive sounds, and rhyming words make for animated reading. For example, kids wiggle their fingers to imitate the movement of ""snipping, snipping"" scissors. Older readers will also gain confidence from reading and enjoying a book in this overlooked genre, discovering a world of rich language often skimmed over in the classroom.

During the summer before she starts middle school, Ruby sees a new girl in their condo complex and is immediately drawn to her. Soon they become best friends, and the idea of starting middle school in the fall doesn't seem so scary anymore. But Ruby learns that their two families may be connected by the crime that landed her mother in jail. Can she keep the connection a secret nd stay best friends with Margalit?
","Veteran author Nora Raleigh Baskin takes on a tough subject with honesty and warmth. Protagonist Ruby is remarkably resilient, nd kids will really relate to her struggles with powerful, sometimes scary emotions, thanks to her strong, believable voice. Intrigue and interest are maintained as Ruby slowly pieces together her mother's story. The plot has a disappointing weakness when one of Ruby's main fears turns out to be unfounded because of a coincidence. Otherwise the story's compelling enough that young readers probably will just breathe a sigh of relief and move on.
RUBY ON THE OUTSIDE will get kids thinking about the criminal justice system nd about how incarceration punishes many more people than the ones actually serving their sentences. ","Parents need to know that Ruby on the Outside, by Nora Raleigh Baskin, takes on the difficult subject of how a child copes with having her mother in prison. The mother's crime (being an accessory to murder) is recounted, and drugs are mentioned several times as involved in the crime, as are how visitation procedures are meant to prevent smuggling drugs into prison. It will get kids thinking about criminal justice nd about jail as an effective (or ineffective) punishment. Ruby's a good role model who finds positive ways to cope with her feelings, and she remains emotionally close to her mother even though they only see each other under difficult circumstances.

One day, when his parents realize neither one can make it to his parent-teacher conference, the TV offers to take their place. They agree, and from that point on the TV takes on more and more parenting duties -- even driving Todd to school and taking him on vacation. His parents are grateful … until the TV proposes adopting Todd. Alarmed, they try all sorts of tricks to wrest their son away from the TV. But it’s Todd who proposes a simple, effective solution: Turn it off.
","There are plenty of laughs here, but parents might not enjoy this as much as their children. Regardless, it’s a wonderful jumping-off point for talking about the role of media in the life of a family.
Most parents agree TV shouldn’t be used as a babysitter … but nearly everyone does it. This sly story places the blame squarely -- and uncomfortably -- at the feet of parents who make excuses for parking their kids in front of the television. Children will find the idea of a walking, talking TV taking Todd to school hysterically funny, and they probably will recognize how Todd’s parents use the TV to keep their son occupied.
Black, white, and gray chunky illustrations with pops of tomato red color are funny and engaging.","Parents need to know that this book won’t reassure them about how much television their kids are watching!

Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck,Extra helping of potty humor in 8th installment.,"Poor Greg. His one good friend, Rowley, has done the unthinkable. He's actually gotten a girlfriend. Now who will walk to school with him and carry his books while watching out for dog messes on the sidewalk? Greg will just have to find himself another sidekick. The only boy desperate enough to take him up on the offer is his bizarre neighbor Fregley, who drops all Greg's books on their first trip to school while running away from the scary Mingo brothers. And then it's Easter, and mom's quarreling sisters and daredevil cousins come to visit. When Greg finds a Magic Eight Ball, he thinks things are finally looking up. It helps him with all kinds of decisions, like which club to join to stay away from the Mingo brothers after school. But he's let his grades slip -- he has no books to study with -- and his science fair project is due next week. What's a Wimpy Kid to do?
","Hard Luck doesn't hold together as well as the other installments. Here's the true test of whether HARD LUCK is up your alley: Does the picture of Greg's dad getting tooted on by Grandma's dog send you into hysterical laughter, or do your eyes immediately roll skyward? If this prompts you to stop reading this review, the book is not for you. Is Jeff Kinney running out of gas/ideas? The quarreling-relatives storyline is a real low point; kids don't care about that stuff.
But there are always little redeeming moments, like all the things Greg finds in his mom's closet. Moms will like this mom with her parenting books and backup stuffed animals and the way she lays down the law to get Greg to bring up his grades but types his paper for him after he turns things around. Maybe that will sink in a little with kids once they're done laughing at the tooting dog.","Parents need to know that Hard Luck is the eighth regular installment in the Wimpy Kid graphic novel series. Reluctant readers are huge fans of this bestselling series, which parents either tolerate because they're thrilled their kid's reading or dislike because the main character, Greg, is always doing something a little bit rotten. Here Greg uses a Magic Eight Ball for a test, alters school yearbook photos in unflattering ways, and lets his grades slip because he's lost all his books and doesn't tell anyone. He's clearly a boy growing into his conscience -- slowly -- but he does the right thing when it really counts, like deciding not to buy another kid's science fair project and showing compassion to a friend at the right time. Violence is pretty low with a few pushy bullies. It's all the potty humor that stands out in this one. Pants are pulled down a few times showing stick cartoon legs in small underwear; Greg's sitting on the toilet a few times, as well. Then there's poor Dad, who has a dog pass gas in his face. Ewww.

The Magician: The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel,Magical twins take on Paris in exciting sequel.,"Suddenly finding themselves in Paris thanks to a magical gateway, California twins Sophie and Josh, the immortal alchemist Nicholas Flamel, and the vampire warrior Scathach must face a new enemy: Machiavelli. He's to collect the magical twins on behalf of the powerful magician Dee. Looking for any ally they can find in Flamel's home city, they run across Saint-Germaine, a former student of Flamel's who's versed in fire magic and currently tops on the techno music charts. But Germaine's house is known to Machiavelli, and it isn't long before scary creatures are unleashed to bring them in.
","THE MAGICIAN is just as fun and exciting as the first book. Maybe even more so, because now Sophie's powers have been awakened and she gets to try them out -- and she's really got some neat tricks up her sleeve, especially after she trains in Saint-Germaine's fire magic. Twin Josh is brooding over not having his powers awakened yet -- and makes some ""what were you thinking?!"" decisions because of it -- but he still gets a heroic warrior moment with a particularly nasty monster.
The book takes readers all over Paris -- even below it into the creepy catacombs -- where all sorts of historical and mythological figures pop up. The author, an authority on mythology and folklore, really unleashes some fascinating creatures on readers and barely restrains himself from delving into each character's complex history -- which is why the book, which takes place over just a couple of days, is close to 500 pages. No matter. This world is fun and exciting enough to let a little extra learning slip in.","Parents need to know that this second book in the series has about the same amount of sword fighting and monster battles as the first -- all of it is suspenseful but not gory. The teen twins with magical powers who are at the center of the story are in almost constant danger. There are some scary scenes in underground caves with giant spiders and creatures that feed off fear and panic. One main character vanishes and is feared dead. Two others can control fire.

Ada Byron Lovelace and the Thinking Machine,Fascinating bio of remarkable 19th-century female inventor.,"ADA BYRON LOVELACE AND THE THINKING MACHINE is the story of a remarkable 19th-century female mathematician and inventor. Born in 1815 London, Ada's mother left her father, poet Lord Byron, and spirited Ada to the countryside to raise her. As a young girl, Ada designed a flying machine and played with calculations in her journal. When a bout of measles left her temporarily blind and dependent on crutches for three years, her mother secured her tutors, who were distinguished mathematicians and scientists. At age 17, Ada met Charles Babbage, who shared his design for a mechanical computer, inspiring her to create mathematical instructions for the machine, thereby writing the world's first computer program ""more than one hundred years before the invention of the modern computer.""
","This extraordinary bio of a Victorian-era mathematician who anticipated computer programming is fascinating and easy to read. Ada Byron Lovelace and the Thinking Machine celebrates Ada's passion for numbers and invention and shows how she weathered difficulties, including her mother's early divorce from her father, the English poet Lord Byron, nd an early illness that left her on crutches. But Ada also benefited from her privileged social standing, studying with tutors and socializing with eminent scientists, and having her passion fully supported by her mother.
Author Laurie Wallmark tells the story deftly, highlighting just the right human and dramatic detail, and April Chu's art brings Ada and her passions vividly to life. A three-page author's note and time line provide more details. This is a welcome invitation for girls to join Ada at the STEM table.","Parents need to know that Ada Byron Lovelace and the Thinking Machine, a biography of a 19th-century female mathematician and inventor, garnered a host of awards, and deservedly so. Ada's father was poet Lord Byron, and she was born with a keen math mind, distinguishing herself in the early 1800s by creating algorithms for a machine that was a precursor to computers, thereby becoming the first computer programmer.

The Moon and More,Savvy coming-of-age tale is great for mature teens.,"Emaline is bracing for the changes in store at summer's end, when she'll leave her close-knit community for college. But life quickly gets more complicated than she could have imagined. Her distant father, who reneged on his offer to pay for Columbia, arrives for the summer with her 10-year-old stepbrother. Her longtime, reliable boyfriend is unpredictable. As that relationship unravels, Theo -- a filmmaker from New York City -- tries to sweep her off her feet. Theo and his prickly boss are making a movie about Clyde, a reclusive artist, and Emaline is drawn into their work. Emaline struggles to reconcile reality with her dreams, and make her own choices about her future before they're decided for her.
\
 ","Sarah Dessen succeeds again in THE MOON AND MORE with authentic teen characters finding their way through messy circumstances. Emaline's relationships with her closest friends, her parents, and even her familiar hometown are changing faster than she can keep up. The summer before college is an strange time, a mix of anticipation and wistfulness, and Dessen nicely captures this unique period.
 The characters feel a little mature for their age. The sexual aspect of Emaline's relationships gets scant attention, particularly for a sexually active teen who was born to a teenage mom. But she has her head squarely on her shoulders, making this a sweet story about summertime romances, letting go of fading dreams, and finding your own path forward.
 ","Parents need to know that The Moon and More is a smart depiction of the emotional push-and-pull that often marks the summer before a teen heads off to college. Lead character Emaline is sexually active with her longtime boyfriend, seems to completely disregard her parents' curfew with no consequences, and underage drinking is treated casually and matter-of-factly. But otherwise, this a sweet story about summertime romances, coming to terms with change, and finding your own way.

Dory Fantasmagory: Book 1,"Funny, relatable tale of 6-year-old with wild imagination.","Dory, better known as Rascal, is the baby of the family and wants her older sister and brother to play with her. But everything she does to get their attention just annoys them instead, especially when she starts populating the house with imaginary monsters, from her straight-out-of-Sendak BFF Mary to the toilet monster, who attacks you if you sit on the john too long. Her siblings' attempt to terrify her with an evil witch called Mrs. Gobble Gracker backfires badly as Dory takes on her new foe with gusto.
","DORY FANTASMAGORY is our introduction to hilarious, strong-willed, 6-year-old Dory, and it's an entertaining one. In words and pictures, Dory bedevils her older sibs with annoying demands for attention and enjoys a lively time with imaginary monsters, some friendly and others scary.
Author-illustrator and former first-grade teacher Abby Hanlon shows a lively understanding of the way kids really think, feel, and act, which will resonate with younger kids, older kids, and adults.

Imaginary Girls,"Dark, disturbing psychological thriller for mature teens.","The entire town seems to fall under the spell of Chloe’s beautiful older sister, Ruby. Chloe almost believes that Ruby can make anything happen just by willing it. When Ruby says Chloe can swim across the entire reservoir, Chloe gives it a try. But when she comes across the dead body of her classmate floating in the water, above the town flooded years ago to create the reservoir, she needs to get away from the trauma, from the reservoir, from her sister. Two years later, though, Ruby wants her back. And Ruby always gets what she wants … almost. To Chloe’s shock, the girl she found floating, lifeless, is now alive. She starts to wonder what, exactly, Ruby is up to.
","It’s nearly impossible to untangle what’s real and what’s imagined in this seductive thriller — just as Chloe has a hard time disentangling love from self-interest. Most of the characters are alternately cruel and callous, and humiliatingly cowed. Mature teens will appreciate this distorted world as the setting for a twisted tragedy. Lyrical writing, perfect details, and a teasing way with the truth make this an absorbing read, though the plot moves at a sometimes glacial pace and character motivation can be as murky as the menacing reservoir itself.","Parents need to know that this is a dark, mature thriller best suited for well-grounded teens who enjoy tales with a paranormal touch. The characters inhabit a world devoid of responsible adults, and they seem to spend all their time drinking and eyeing each other warily (or greedily, when it comes to boys and girls). There is sex, drugs, swearing, and violence -- as well as menacing tone.

I Am a Pole (And So Can You!),"Clever, satirical picture book isn't really for kids.","A pole doesn't know what type of pole he should be, so he tries to find his \""true pole role,\"" taking a stab at being a lamp pole, barber pole, maypole, totem pole, fireman's pole, telephone pole, etc., before finally finding something that suits him: being a pole for an American flag.
","For satire-savvy fans of wordplay and Stephen Colbert's humor, I AM A POLE (AND SO CAN YOU!) will be a delightful diversion. But this seemingly cute picture book isn't really for little kids due to its sophisticated jokes about such things as the Gallup Poll and evolution and one scene in which the pole is onstage for a pole-dancer who's wearing only a G-string, heels, and tasseled pasties on her breasts. ","Parents need to know that comedian Stephen Colbert's picture book, I Am a Pole (And So Can You), isn't really for kids. It reflects his sarcastic humor and includes the adult concern of being called at dinnertime to answer questions for a Gallup poll; a coy visual reference to his late-night TV show, The Colbert Report; and a scantily clad pole dancer. The wordplay is clever and funny, but the book seems intended for adults and media-savvy tweens and teens who are in on the joke rather than for the usual age 4-to-8 picture book audience -- the pole-dancer image pretty much kills this as a book for little kids. The title and cover image recall Colbert's bestselling book for adults, I Am America (And So Can You!).

Book Scavenger,Fascinating mystery nurtures a love of puzzles and codes.,"Twelve-year-old Emily is used to moving around; her parents are on a mission to eventually live in all 50 states. But when she moves to San Francisco, she's particularly thrilled because it's the home of her favorite author, Garrison Griswold, the creator of Book Scavenger, a game that involves hiding books, finding clues, and tracking them down for points and bragging rights. The trouble is, Griswold has been shot, and a rare book in his possession has been lost. Emily gets her hands on it, but she still has to crack the code before the thieves who attacked Griswold do it first.
","BOOK SCAVENGER is a book lover's delight: It weaves in mysteries, puzzles, and secret treasure with the real histories of beloved authors. Emily is an admirable and relatably flawed character for book worms. She gets caught up in the stories she loves, sometimes to the detriment of her real-world relationships. Here, readers are encouraged to break codes and solve puzzles alongside the protagonist, consider the history of famous authors in a new light, and navigate relationships with friends and loved ones as they move in and out of the world of books and the world we inhabit every day. The book could engage otherwise reluctant readers, s it shows that the life of the mind can be plenty exciting in real life while reinforcing the engrossing escape books can offer. It also features definitions in the back, with resources for real-life Book Scavengers that readers can participate in.","Parents need to know that Book Scavenger is a captivating, engaging mystery set in San Francisco with a 12-year-old girl as protagonist. It includes puzzles, ciphers, and codes, in addition to detective work. A prominent character is shot in the back and spends the majority of the novel unconscious as preteens work to solve the mystery of his attack while also participating in a book scavenger hunt. The novels puts intellectual curiosity, puzzles, and problem-solving front and center while weaving in the true history of Edgar Allan Poe and other authors. A must-read for book and puzzle lovers.

Crazy Hair,Offbeat fantasy in a head of hair is fun and a bit creepy.,"Slightly reminiscent of the man whose beard cradled bird's nests, this is a book about a man with hair that houses an outlandish world beyond imagination. When a young girl says he has crazy hair, the man goes off on a poetic tangent about all the creatures that live in his hair. She tries to comb it, but suddenly she is more than an observer.
","While the premise of this book is pretty far-fetched, the language dances through illustrations that are definitely eye-catching. Rhymes speak of tangles and twists of cockatoos, tigers, pirate sloops, and hunting expeditions; imaginative, and definitely unique, artwork depicts each crazy world. Together they build a bee-hive of fun in what might only be called a frenzy of fantasy.
Dave McKean's artwork is colorful and swirly, full of computer enhanced images and a kind of magic you can't quite put your finger on. Rather ugly and distorted at one moment, looking like comic book graphics at another, always with touches of the realistic, it stretches past the poetry toward the edge of somewhere very strange, all of which is quite appropriate to a world existing in a head of hair. If the poetry doesn't grab you, the octopus-like tendrils of tresses certainly will. Just ask Bonnie.
The artwork is quirky, unusual, and eye-catching, and definitely fits the odd story.","Parents need to know that this fantasy about creatures living in a crazy head of hair might not appeal to everyone. People with a head full of wild hair, kids who hate to have their hair combed, or readers who just like silly scenarios will get a kick out of the humor. This is a book that definitely grows on you.

The Short Second Life of Bree Tanner,Twilight series offshoot has heavier doses of horror.,"The title says it all: 16-year-old Bree Tanner was introduced briefly in Eclipse, and this explores her experiences as she learns how to be a vampire, under the direction of Riley, also introduced in Eclipse. Riley's Seattle coven is made up of turned teen street kids, still learning to control their blood lust; they hunt without remorse. When Bree meets Diego, a supernaturally beautiful vampire (surprise!), they spend a day together and find an intense romantic connection. Diego shares his own discoveries about being a vampire. But then Riley's plans for this army of newborn vampires to attack the ""yellow-toothed"" vampire coven (the Cullens) sends Bree and Diego in different directions and soon it's all over. The book was made available for free online at www.breetanner.com through July 5, 2010.
","It's tragic, it's short, it seems like a good idea for a story, but Bree's life before she is turned is never explored. Her intense but innocent romantic interlude (gotten over with right at the beginning) mimics all the other romance in the saga, and the vampire violence is heavier and darker with none of the redeeming sympathy we came to feel for the Cullens. An interesting new vampire, Fred the freak, is introduced, but like Diego, we never learn where his supernatural power came from or who he is.
Fans looking for more Cullens will get a glimpse of them near the book's end. The rare fan who's in it for the horror and battle scenes will get a big build-up to the final battle.
 ","Parents need to know that this Twilight Saga spinoff is more horror than romance. There is darker, bloodier violence here than in the rest of the saga, rightfully so, as readers are experiencing life as a vampire. The completely sociopathic bloodlust of even the newest vampires sets up a dramatic counterpoint to the Cullen's coven, even though the family doesn't appear until the very end. Bree is a simple character, and in typical Twilight fashion, as soon as she meets a very handsome boy, he becomes her reason for living. Unfortunately we never learn what makes him so special.

Self-absorbed queen Red Riding Hood and hard-living Mother Goose -- bearing little resemblance to their traditional versions, let alone anyone's role model -- are frequently hilarious and occasionally risqué as they romp through The Prince, the Black Plague, and other unlikely terrain.
","Fans of Colfer's best-selling fairy tale series will be right at home, and often in stitches, with this kitchen-sink barrage of double entendre, advocacy, over-the-top characters, and pure looniness.

Readers who don't know this particular version of Red Riding Hood nd Mother Goose from the series are going to be really confused almost at once. In the course of delivering her multi-century, multi-world backstory, the hard-drinking, hard-gambling Mother Goose romps through history, from having romances with Leonardo da Vinci and Henry VIII to giving really bad advice to Marie Antoinette, finishing with a march in a marriage-equality parade. In a bizarre interlude, Mother Goose distracts a bunch of kids dying of the Black Plague by reciting nursery rhymes. (They die anyway, but she finds her calling.) By contrast, the Red Riding Hood book, ""written"" by the most over-the-top, self-absorbed character in the series, is often hysterically funny as Red instructs her fans on the fine points of ruling (e.g., ""Peasants Are Like Pets""), with mangled advice from Machiavelli to Hamlet. In the series, she's romantically involved with the Frog Prince, so here she offers a tale of how her subjects objected to interspecies romance, and what she did about it.

All of This Is True,Writer uses teens' secrets for stories in riveting thriller.,"In ALL OF THIS IS TRUE, four teens can't believe their luck when they are befriended by a YA author they idolize. That initial excitement turns to sorrow, anger, and dread when their lives unravel and the relationship turns out not to be all that it seems. The four teens -- Miri, Soleil, Penny, and Jonah -- are shallow, privileged students at an exclusive prep school on Long Island. Being on top socially matters to them, so they feed on the attention and associated fame from being in author Fatima Ro's inner circle. They eat up Ro's advice on living an authentic life and adopt her cult-like terminology, but when they put her advice into practice, deeps secrets are exposed and lives are shattered. The teens are left wondering whether they were Ro's pawns all along and can't be sure of what was true and what was a lie.
","This sharp, riveting social drama and psychosocial thriller is impossible to put down. Author Lygia Day Peñaflor goes meta with All of This Is True, spinning a YA story about a YA author who mines the lives of teens for her subject matter. The novel starts out feeling like fluff, but as it progresses it delves into interesting issues around teen social structures, mob mentality, social media, and who stories belong to. Because of the shallowness of their lives, Miri, Soleil, Penny, and Jonah are so thrilled by the friendship and reflected fame of being close to famous author Fatima Ro that they don't question why an adult would want to be their friend, or the downsides of exposing their entire lives to her. The subject resonates in this over-sharing era of lifestyle bloggers, influencers, and Instagram fame. The thriller aspect comes from the creepiness of Fatima's cult-like hold over the teens and her new-age terminology that they weave into their lives, such as ""inside/out"" for total transparency and ""precious truths"" for their deepest thoughts.
The format of the book is interesting but bogs it down at the outset. Between the two television interviews, the published journal excerpts, and passages from two novels, there's a lot to keep track of. But it falls into place about one-third of the way into the story.","Parents need to know that All of This Is True is about the manipulative relationship between four teens and the YA author they idolize. The story is part social drama, part psychological thriller. Flattered to be befriended by a novelist whose work they love, the shallow, status-conscious teens eat up the attention she shines on them, to disastrous consequences. The story is set in a wealthy  community on New York's Long Island, where the teens attend an exclusive private school. Cliques, privilege, elitism, and social-media fame all factor into the story. Characters make some bad decisions, though there's no drinking or drug use in the book. Characters swear infrequently, including ""s--t,"" ""f--k,"" and ""bitch."" Issues of honesty, social status, cliques, and idol worship provide interesting discussion topics.

Vampire Academy,"Sexy, mean-girl vampire story has strong language, bullying.","Rose and Lissa are on the run for some mysterious reason. Readers soon find out why when Rose, a dhamphir (guardian to the Moroi vampires) and Lissa, a Moroi vampire princess, must return to St. Vladimir's Academy. At school they discover more mysterious and secrets within St. Vladimir's walls. Rose and Lissa encounter something else at the academy, too: forbidden romance.
","VAMPIRE ACADEMY imagines a different kind of vampire, but the story is pretty much Mean Girls meets Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Rose thinks she has a sarcastic wit but it comes off more nasty than funny. She's extremely vain about her looks and thinks about boys 24/7. Her only redeeming quality is that she truly cares for her best friend, Lissa, and wants to protect her at any cost. Yet, her ""I'm better than you"" attitude's hard to get past. Granted Rose has some kick-butt fighting skills, but there are plenty of terrific heroines in other YA books. Vampire Academy seems more about high school life with vampires and a mystery thrown in the mix -- not much to sink your teeth into.","Parents need to know that Vampire Academy is the first book in a popular series by Richelle Mead, featuring two girls at St. Vladimir's Academy: Lissa, who discovers she's a vampire princess, and Rose, a vampire guardian committed to protecting her. A movie adaptation hits theaters in February 2014. While the trailer for the movie makes it looks like a comedy, the novel's dark and full of Mean Girls-style high school bullying. The characters bicker from beginning to end, especially Rose. And there's violence (neck biting, hand-to-hand combat), drinking, sex, and lots of strong language, including ""a--hole,"" ""dumbass,"" ""badass,"" ""bitch,"" ""f--k,"" ""pissed,"" ""slut,"" ""whore,"" and ""bastard.""

Hot Air: The (Mostly) True Story of the First Hot-Air  Balloon Ride,"Pretty, silly tale of balloon flight by animals.","In 1783, thousands gather at the palace at Versailles to see the world's first hot-air balloon flight. The passengers in the basket? A duck, a sheep, and a rooster. All of this is historical fact.
After this introduction, Marjorie Priceman, in a nearly wordless section, goes on to imagine what that flight might have been like for the animals, had they been possessed of near-human intelligence and emotions, and a talent for pratfalls. They soar over France, getting tangled up in clotheslines, shot at by a boy with a bow and arrow, bumping into a church steeple, nearly falling out, getting flooded and attacked by birds, and finally crash-landing safely. It concludes with a brief timeline of the year leading up to the real event.
","This unique book begins and ends with historical information, and in the middle is a silly, wordless picture book that anthropomorphizes the slapstick antics of the three animal heroes. It's easy to see why it won a Caldecott honor: It is gorgeously illustrated in detailed pen, ink, and watercolor paintings filled with clever and humorous details that reward close inspection. For instance, in some panels the clouds in the background take on interesting shapes, while elements in earlier pictures, such as an arrow and a bird, come to play prominent parts in later ones.
The text, what there is of it, is straightforward, with humorous touches. All together it makes for an entertaining, if somewhat schizophrenic, tale.","Parents need to know that there's nothing to worry about here. The animals in the hot air balloon face some difficulties -- they get tangled up in clothesline, shot at by a boy with a bow and arrow, and bump into a church steeple, nearly falling out -- but in the end, they are unscathed.

"The Bravest Princess: A Tale of the Wide-Awake Princess, Book 3","More adventure, romance as Annie and Liam help Snow White.","Annie's good friend Snow White is in trouble. She needs help selecting a prince to help rule her kingdom now that her evil stepmother has been banished from the castle. But as Annie makes the journey with Liam and prepares for sister Gwendolyn's wedding, there are threats from all sides, this time from a witch who's learned how to work around the fact that Annie is unaffected by magic. Can she help Snow White find true love while protecting herself from the evil witch Terobella?
","THE BRAVEST PRINCESS amps up the action and adventure, with Annie and Liam facing danger and excitement (and some very innocent romance) around every corner. What makes this third installment a nice detour from the previous books is the way Annie and Liam negotiate their relationship -- they have different skills, and each wants to save the other, but they must learn how to let each other's strengths work for the team. Furthermore, Annie learns to help a friend sort out another big existential question: What is true love really about, especially when people aren't always what they seem? How do we determine a person's true character? Fans of the series will find more of Liam but a lot more of Annie charging into the action and testing her mettle, and, for parents who are hesitant about princess books, here's one that will introduce nuance and character to what is so often a disappointing genre. Though the question of looks is unavoidable in the subject matter -- who has them, who had them, who lost them, who found them -- here, readers are still challenged to unpack assumptions about ""real"" beauty and its ultimate significance compared with character.","Parents need to know that The Bravest Princess is the third book in the Wide-Awake Princess series by E.D. Baker. With a headstrong, courageous princess protagonist, this installment upholds the series' unique challenge to typical princess fare by focusing on resourcefulness, autonomy, skill-building, and wits over looks or passivity. Here, Princess Annabelle rescues and is rescued, risks life and limb to protect those around her, and demonstrates that princesses need not sit on the sidelines. Though questions of looks and beauty are inevitable, readers are encouraged to sort out what real beauty is and how important it is in the grand scheme of things.

I Am Sacagawea: Ordinary People Change the World,Strong Native American teen guide shines in lively history.,"I AM SACAGAWEA makes it clear that the famed Native American guide of the Lewis and Clark Expedition had a lot of adversity to deal with -- starting with the fact that we have no idea what her real name was, as it was her captors who gave her the name ""Sacagawea."" Storyteller Brad Meltzer and illustrator Christopher Eliopoulous bring the title character (and the baby who's her constant companion) to life in a series of engaging episodes as she faces many challenges and saves the day more than once.

Max's Christmas,Kids will relate to appealing holiday tale.,"Who? When? Where? How? These are the questions children typically ask about the legendary Santa Claus, and little bunny Max is no different. Max decides to find out for himself whether Santa really exists. This story of the time-honored legend may reinforce some children's beliefs while prompting others to question the plausibility of Santa Claus.
 ","For families who have Santa as a part of their Christmas tradition, MAX'S CHRISTMAS will be welcomed year-round. Max, a trusting little bunny, often finds himself vulnerable to the antics of his wiser big sister, Ruby. But in this story, her magical tale of Santa Claus proves to be true, much to Max's delight and Ruby's surprise!
Rosemary Wells' charming watercolor paintings convey the warmth and spirit of the holidays. The backgrounds, typical of cartoon illustrations, are kept to a minimum but are dramatically shaded to give the impression of nighttime, which adds to the drama of the Santa mystery. The peculiar illustration of Santa's departure may elicit questions from children as to how it is possible to exit up a chimney.","Parents need to know that this holiday tale revolves around Santa.

A Wind in the Door,Classic science fiction with timeless appeal.,"Unusual things happen in high school freshman Meg Murry's family. Her parents are famous scientists, and her six-year-old brother, Charles Wallace, is a genius. But Charles Wallace has been mysteriously ill, and when he tells Meg there are dragons in the garden, she worries that he is fantasizing.
Then she sees the fantastic creature, actually a ""singular cherubim."" It has been sent by a wise, humanlike Teacher to help Meg in a quest to heal Charles Wallace. Also accompanying her will be her friend, Calvin O'Keefe, and her archenemy, Mr. Jenkins, the dour principal of Charles Wallace's school.
The travelers journey from a faraway galaxy to inside Charles Wallace's body, where a cosmic battle is taking place. By kything--communicating without words--and learning the importance of Naming (loving) her enemies, Meg saves her brother with the help of both Calvin and the surprisingly lovable Mr. Jenkins.
","With believable characters and a suspenseful plot, this is arguably the best of the sequels to the classic A Wrinkle in Time. This is the second of Madeleine L'Engle's Chronos Quartet novels featuring the Murry family and their journeys through time and space. In some books in the Quartet, the hypersensitive, loving, and gifted Murry children speak and act like people much older or younger than their given years. Here they face enough real-kid problems, such as Charles Wallace's torment at the hands of school bullies, to seem real.
The three trials Meg must pass are interpersonal; her ability to communicate love is tested. Some scenes are long on dialogue and short on action; ""too many talky scenes"" was one 12-year-old's only negative comment. Yet there are enough surprises to sustain the suspense, and the ideas that drive the scenes are interesting. This is a rewarding book with generous helpings of the L'Engle magic.","Parents need to know that the highly original plot and memorable characters appeal to a wide group of readers. The vocabulary and ideas are inventive, and the story promotes the importance of loving relationships. While some of the science is made up, the trip inside Charles Wallace's body is a mini-lesson in cell biology.

Unbecoming,"Family secrets, mature themes in thoughtful drama.","Katie kissed a girl, and she liked it. Unfortunately the girl, Katie's best friend, then destroys what little social standing Katie had at school. In the midst of all this drama, Katie's estranged grandmother unexpectedly comes to stay with Katie, her mother, and younger brother. Grandmother Mary suffers from memory loss, probably from Alzheimer's, and Katie now has to spend the summer taking care of Mary, who escapes the house daily to wander lost around town. To try to help Mary's memory, Katie starts writing down Mary's stories about her past. Family secrets start to come out, enraging Katie's mother, who wants to keep them all firmly locked away. But Mary's not the only one with secrets: Katie can't be honest about herself with her family or friends, and her mother's definitely hiding something, too. Katie's determined to find out the truth about her family, but when opening old wounds starts to tear everything and everyone apart, can Katie's UNBECOMING heal the wounds and bring peace to herself and her family?
","This drama set in the United Kingdom is an absorbing look at family dynamics and how the past, even if it’s forgotten, continues to echo through the following generations. Shifting points of view between 17-year-old Katie and her grandmother add depth and richness to the slow reveal of the family’s past. It also broadens the appeal beyond YA; Unbecoming is a book that can be savored by adults and teens alike. Teen drama and romance are definitely present, but they take a backseat to piecing together Grandmother Mary’s story, so it’s best for mature, independent readers who enjoy family history and dynamics.
This is Jenny Downham’s third YA novel, and she continues to hone her skill with varied, believable narrators who are easy to relate to. The different voices in different periods of time are ably unified by an underlying warmth, sly humor, and refreshing honesty that keep the engaging characters on your mind long after the last page is turned.","Parents need to know that Unbecoming is the story of three generations of women and how their past and the secrets they've kept reverberate across time and one another. It explores mature themes through the points of view of each woman at different times in their lives, making it best for strongly independent readers fascinated by family history and dynamics. Drinking, smoking, and strong language are rare; one party is matter-of-fact about teens drinking beer and cocktails, and it's mentioned that they're probably high or drunk. Smoking in the '50s and '60s is mentioned more frequently. There are a few kisses between same-sex and opposite-sex couples as Katie, 17, starts to realize she's attracted to girls. Teen pregnancy is a prominent theme, and a painful labor and childbirth are described. Other mature themes include memory loss, developmental delay, hiding the truth, and abandonment.

Say Something,"Inspiring book spurs kids to speak up, stand up.","SAY SOMETHING insists that ""the world needs your voice"" and challenges readers to say something ""in so many ways. With words, with action, with heart."" Each page offers an example of a way to say something -- on a canvas with a paintbrush, in an empty lot by planting seeds so flowers will grow, by yelling ""Hey! Stop!"" when you see a kid hurting another kid, by telling someone how hurt you felt when he they made you feel invisible, just to name a few. From the personal to the political, there are lots of examples of diverse kids expressing their feelings, beliefs, opinions, and even discoveries, as when a girl at a microscope gets a ""brilliant idea"" and shouts, ""Eurkea!"" The end papers feature speech balloons filled with messages such as ""THINK GREEN,"" ""HATE HAS NO HOME HERE,"" ""Be the change you want to see happen,"" and ""Your voice matters.""
","This inspiring book does a great job of encouraging kids to speak up and express their thoughts and feelings, opinions and compassion, and showing the many ways this can be done. Say Something! insists, ""The world needs your voice,"" while acknowledging, ""Some people find it easier to say something than others ... but everyone has something to say."" And ""it doesn't need to be perfect, as long as it's from your heart.""
Author-illustrator Peter H. Reynolds' accessible cartoony characters and simple speech balloons make each concept easy to grasp and relate to.

Blue Sky White Stars,"Stirring, poetic take on America and flag has majestic art.","BLUE SKY WHITE STARS repeats short lines of text about our flag and nation, illustrating them in different ways. It starts with text describing the flag itself -- ""Blue sky/White stars,"" ""Red rows,"" ""White rows,"" ""Red, white, and blue,"" and ""Old Glory"" -- and shows images of the flag juxtaposed with majestic landscapes. It moves on to include people -- for instance, Lincoln's lined face to illustrate ""Well worn"" and civil rights marchers holding hands for ""Woven together."" ""Stand proud"" shows Civil War soldiers and a young woman of color in graduation robes. The message throughout is that we're all one nation, epitomized in the multihued mix of faces illustrating ""So together one nation.""
","Poetic text and stunning art make this a flag-waving book with a difference, inviting readers to celebrate America's patriotic symbols nd think about its rich, multicultural history. The text in Blue Sky White Stars is more expressive than informational, with author Sarvinder Naberhaus repeating short phrases such as ""Blue sky white stars,"" ""Old Glory,"" and ""Woven together."" She also includes phrases that sound alike but have different meanings -- for instance, ""Sew together/Won nation"" (Betsy Ross sewing flag) and ""So together/One nation"" (faces of various races). The spare text makes the book perfect for young kids, but older kids will enjoy thinking about the plays on words.
There could be no better illustrator for this project than Kadir Nelson, who pictures an inclusive, multiracial America and whose paintings of American faces, symbols, and landscapes are breathtaking and arresting. His choice of subject is always thought-provoking. In one spread, ""All American,"" he presents an image of a brightly lit baseball stadium next to an image of an older African-American man listening to the game on the radio with his grandson. Though Nelson's art captures the majesty of our multihued nation and the varied faces of its people, the omission of direct reference to Native Americans is glaring.","Parents need to know that Blue Sky White Stars, about the United States and the American flag, has evocative but minimal text by Indian-American writer Sarvinder Naberhaus, and lush, gorgeous illustrations by award-winning African-American artist Kadir Nelson (I Have a Dream).

Annie Lee and her mom have since moved to a smaller apartment in a different part of Durham, North Carolina, where she's started a new school. Her friends Monica and Meredith, who were once her BFF's, have moved on, and Annie Lee is left with her searing grief and loneliness. She tries to be invisible, but knows she can't hide forever. When she starts taking off on her scooter after school without her mom knowing, she meets a man at a local mall who plays piano in a way that literally makes Annie see beautiful lights dancing off his fingertips. She decides to try to learn enough piano to compete in a competition that could help her earn a little money for her struggling household. After she connects with this musician, named Ray, she starts to open up enough to become friends with a girl named Mitch at her new school. Her dad hasn't let go at home, however, showing up in ghostly ways that aren't always helpful to Annie Lee and her mom. Eventually, Annie Lee has to tell her mom about sneaking out, and she has to learn to take risks in order to build trust and love in a world without her beloved dad. ","This is a fearless exploration of the despair that follows the death of a parent, but the otherworldly spect of this well-meaning story doesn't quite gel. A bag of donuts appears on the table in the apartment on the first day of school, but nobody bought them. The record player plays songs at will. Annie Lee's mom cleans out the sink every morning because remnants of a shave ppear daily. Annie Lee and her mom shrug off these poltergeist moments as visits from Annie Lee's dead father. There's not quite enough suspense or build-up for these moments to be believable-- no one's startled or afraid of the fact that really ghostly things are happening in their home -- so they end up feeling a little distracting.  What does work in this story, and what kids will appreciate, is the helplessness Annie Lee feels when she hears her mom crying all the time. Thre's also the shame of having to wash last year's clothes in the bathtub because money is really tight and the washing machine's broken. Kids will understand Annie Lee's desire to feel invisible and how she finds solace in music. She really feels the pain of being bandoned by her dad and her best friends. But she ends up making  new friend who is fierce and caring at the same time. All of these aspects of the story feel like just what Annie Lee needs to happen so she can go through the process of growth, recovery, and letting go.

Meanwhile, at home, the record player starts up on its own accord, the sink is filled with her father's shaving stubble, and her mom cries constantly. Poverty looms large, making Annie very conscious about her appearance at her new middle school. Annie's friend at school describes being harassed at her former school for having ""developed"" before the other girls did, causing her to enroll in the larger public school, where boys continue to snap her bra strap.

Scan,Clever sci-fi thriller stresses do-it-yourself science.,"Tate doesn't understand why his father pushes him so hard to excel in school and in martial arts or why his dad is so secretive about his work and research. After Tate steals a mysterious device from his father's lab and brings it to the high school, he precipitates a series of unintended and ultimately tragic events. Before he knows what's happening, he, his mother, and his girlfriend Christina are on the run from extraterrestrial agents who will stop at nothing to retrieve the gadget.
","SCAN is a high-concept sci-fi thriller with some interestingly unique features. There have been plenty of alien-invasion books featuring extraterrestrials who look, act, and talk just like us earthlings, but by adding a MacGyver-ish do-it-yourself science spin to the tale, coauthors Walter Jury and S.E. Fine give their narrative some extra oomph. The action scenes are well choreographed, and there are a number of satisfying plot reversals. Tate's interactions with his estranged parents are well done, but his continuous insistence on how absolutely awesome his girlfriend is gets a little old after a while. This volume makes no excuses for ending on a cliffhanger, but it will leave most readers primed for the next installment.
One wonders why the language needs to be so rough; Scan contains more casual profanity than many adult science-fiction thrillers, and whatever it gains in edginess it loses in gracelessness.","Parents needs to know that Scan is an action-packed, science-fiction thriller about an alien invasion. It contains shoot-outs and car chases, some of which result in fatalities. The protagonist, Tate, uses household items to make explosives and nonlethal weapons, but the details of their construction are withheld. Tate and his girlfriend Christina spend a lot of time kissing and hugging, but they pull back when things get too steamy. Profanity and vulgar language -- ranging from variations of ""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" and ""a--hole"" to ""bastard,"" ""bitch,"" ""p---y,"" ""damn,"" and ""hell"" -- are used very frequently.

The Fourteenth Goldfish,"Funny, sweet fountain-of-youth fantasy about growing wiser.","Eleven-year-old Ellie feels adrift in her first year of middle school. Her parents are worried about her finding her passion, but she's more concerned about the growing distance between herself and her best friend. Life gets a lot more interesting when Ellie's mother brings home an odd 13-year-old boy who grouses about the lawn, badgers her about the honor roll, and scolds her mom about her outfit. Ellie's startled to realize this boy is her Grandpa Melvin, a scientist who has found a way to reverse aging with help from a rare jellyfish. Ellie realizes she and her grandpa have more in common than she knew, but she's worried his breakthrough might not be as wonderful as Melvin believes it is.
","THE FOURTEENTH GOLDFISH is a sweetly written story about coping with change and growing older, infused with both joy and melancholy. Author Jennifer L. Holm, known for the Babymouse and Squish graphic novel series, gets into some weighty material here: the pain of growing old and letting go, scientific discovery as a double-edged sword, and the relationships between parents and children across the decades. But Holm keeps things light and easy by focusing on the positive: Where one thing ends, after all, something new begins.
Cantankerous Melvin is an especially enjoyable character, lighting up the narrative with comparatively placid Ellie as his foil. Even with a healthy willing suspension of disbelief, the story strains plausibility: An ordinary middle schooler would be mortified to be seen with Melvin, with his odd style of dress or grouchy demeanor. Instead of tween navel-gazing, Holm uses Ellie as analytical observer who often seems the most emotionally mature of the bunch. ","Parents need to know that The Fourteenth Goldfish by Jennifer L. Holm (Babymouse, Squish, Middle School Is Worse Than Meatloaf) is a warm and thoughtful look at science, morality, and the circle of life. It pulls no punches about the so-called golden years, from physical problems to the loss of friends: At one point, Ellie's grandfather says he'd rather be dead than old. The reading level is fine for 8-year-olds, but the themes of change and aging are more likely to resonate with older elementary school students.

Kipper's Toybox,Engaging pictures work well with the simple story.,"A hole in his toy box leads Kipper to the discovery that he has too many toys! Seven, eight, five--first there's too many and then there's too little--as the perplexed pup counts over and again. There's a surprise in store for Kipper and readers in this sweet tale accompanied by engaging illustrations.
 ","KIPPER'S TOYBOX is another entertaining installment chronicling the adventures of this amiable pup. Mick Inkpen imbues Kipper with plenty of character; parents and caregivers will smile wryly at Kipper's typically child-like actions, while kids identify with him. Inkpen understands kids, right down to the quirky objects that become a small child's treasures: an unmatched slipper, a novelty sock, and a tattered stuffed animal.
The full-color, whimsical illustrations are a perfect counterpart to the story, offering clues for observant readers. A wriggly pink tail or twitchy nose randomly pop up in the illustrations, making this tale more fun to read the second time around as readers pore over the pictures to locate the elusive mice. Situated against gleaming white backgrounds, the vivid pictures seem to leap off the pages.","Parents need to know that light suspense keeps readers intrigued.

Ladybug Girl and the Dress-up Dilemma,Ladybug Girl picks Halloween costume in charming adventure.,"It's Halloween! Lulu, on the advice of her older brother, must not be Ladybug Girl again. So she sets off to try on a number of other costumes that are all pretty appealing in their own way: an octopus, an alien, a robot, and more. But nothing feels quite right. As Lulu goes about her favorite Halloween activities, picking apples and joining a hayride, an adventure comes along that gives her a chance to rediscover exactly who she should really be.
","The Ladybug Girl series fires on all cylinders, and LADYBUG GIRL AND THE DRESS-UP DILEMMA is no different. Here, there's a clever interplay between Lulu's sense of who she should be for Halloween, according to her brother and tradition, and her desire to still inhabit the identity that feels right, and it's all underscored with vivid, evocative watercolor scenes of hay, falling leaves, and pinkish sunsets that evoke both the past and the present simultaneously.
This series encourages creativity as much as unstructured time, and there's a nice pacing that suggests every dilemma is figured out in due time with a little space and a lot of encouragement to find your own way.","Parents need to know that Ladybug Girl and the Dress-Up Dilemma continues the popular Ladybug Girl series, this time at Halloween. Here, Lulu explores issues of identity related to choosing a Halloween costume.

Homecoming,Classic novel of four brave children looking for a home.,"Part survival tale, part family story, this classic on-the-road novel features a family of four brave children led by 13-year-old Dicey. Abandoned by their mother in the parking lot of a Connecticut mall, the Tillerman children make a long, dangerous trip to Maryland to find a home.
","The plot sprawls, but that's acceptable in a road novel. The tedium, heat, danger, and unexpected pleasures of the journey are evoked in beautiful, sometimes heart-stopping images. However, some of the adult characters' dialogue doesn't sound entirely believable.
The lead character, Dicey Tillerman, absolutely carries this book. She is a magnificent girl -- fiercely loyal, endlessly resourceful, and intuitive, yet with the short temper and quick emotions of any 13-year-old. Seen through Dicey's watchful eyes, the other children are every bit as believable.","Parents need to know that Homecoming is the first book in a seven-part series known as the Tillerman Cycle. A National Book Award finalist first published in 1981 and reissued in hardcover in March 2012, Homecoming is the compelling story of four siblings, age 6 to 13, who are abandoned by their mother in a parking lot, and have no father to go home to (he left before the fourth kid was born). Throughout the book, they struggle for food and shelter and are often in danger as they seek out relatives miles away to take them in. Mental illness and death are discussed.

The Great Gatsby,"American classic captures romance, debauchery of Jazz Age.","Nick Carraway spends a summer living in a cheap rental house surrounded by lavish mansions on Long Island in the 1920s. Among his neighbors are his beautiful cousin Daisy, her loutish husband Tom, and her former lover, Jay Gatsby, whose history and epic parties are fodder for gossip. Nick becomes caught up in the machinery of more than one romantic triangle as the summer begins to fade and Gatsby's orchestra stops playing.
","THE GREAT GATSBY is a magnificent novel on every level. Fitzgerald writes about the Jazz Age in language that beautifully evokes music. He writes about a hot day in a way that almost makes you sweat. His characters are well-drawn, and the plot is engaging and fast-paced. Though this novel is possibly best appreciated by college-level readers, advanced high school students will find a lot to enjoy and discuss.","Parents need to know that THE GREAT GATSBY is at once a romantic and cynical novel about the wealth and habits of a group of New Yorkers during the Jazz Age. Fitzgerald's writing is unassailably magnificent, as he paints a grim portrait of shallow characters who maneuver themselves into complex situations. This classic American novel is required reading for a lot of high school students, and it can definitely be appreciated and understood on some levels by teenagers. However, Fitzgerald's use of language and symbolism is best appreciated by mature readers able to analyze literature and think critically. Parents also need to know that some characters express racial and religious prejudice.

War Games,Slow-starting but tense tale of occupied Greece.,"Petros's family are farmers in rural Greece. When their small town is occupied by the Germans during WWII, and the German colonel comes to live in their house, they try to go on with their lives as best as they can. But with a secret past and a resistance soldier hiding in their well, even the most ordinary life becomes dangerous.
","Based on Akila Couloumbis' wartime childhood memories, this story has a reality much different from most Hollywood-influenced war stories. But by the same token, real life in an occupied village wasn't always filled with slam-bang excitement, and this story can be slow at times -- realistic, but not always enthralling. This is best for patient readers. Those who do have the patience will find that the suspense and tension ratchet slowly up, and there are moments that are breathless and moving.
There are no great victories or defeats, though the ending is quite satisfying, there's no resolution, little in the way of heroics, and no cardboard villains either. In fact it's the German colonel, doing his best to make an unpleasant situation less unpleasant, who says, ""I think we can agree. Wars should be fought among men, not boys. Boys have to grow up. Even in war, boys play."" These are people who quietly endure, who try to live a life as ordinary as possible in extraordinary times, and who know what's most important.","Parents need to know that, for a wartime book, there is not a lot of violence.

As she starts to suspect that her mother may have meant to move away for more than just a year, Molly's less and less able to control her compulsions, and more afraid people will think she's crazy and won't want anything to do with her. But what if she is crazy? How can she get the help she so desperately needs?
","Author Elly Swartz's rock-solid voice for 12-year-old Molly creates a compelling and likeable hero whose struggle with anxiety will really resonate with tweens. They'll learn a lot about what it's like to suffer with OCD, and they'll be encouraged to see the person and not the disorder.
The well-structured story keeps the pages turning as Molly negotiates the hazards of school and home life. Tweens will find a lot of hope during a time of big changes in their own lives as Molly learns that she'll be OK even without Finding Perfect, and how to live in a world where so many things are outside her control.","Parents need to know that Finding Perfect is the story of a 12-year-old girl who starts to show obsessive-compulsive tendencies after her mother moves out of the country for a job.

"Galaxy's Most Wanted, Book 1","Summer camp gets alien visitors in silly, fun adventure.","When Kevin Brewer and his friends at a summer science camp in the woods of Oregon devise an invention to contact aliens -- based on a sci-fi comic book they'd read -- their efforts succeed beyond their wildest expectations. A multi-eyed, multi-armed fuzz-ball extraterrestrial named Mim crashes his small spaceship into a lake near the camp and immediately befriends Kevin and his pals. They're intent on keeping Mim hidden until they can reveal that their alien-contact machine worked and win the camp's prestigious Invention Convention prize. Can the campers keep Mim hidden from the other campers? Will they win the prize? Strange things begin to happen, and suddenly the kids -- and our planet! -- are faced with unimaginable peril. The kids must unite with their fellow campers and counselors in a fight for humankind.
","GALAXY'S MOST WANTED is a zippy, engaging adventure that should appeal equally to boys and girls looking for some silly reading fun. Author John Kloepfer has a good ear for kids' language and attitude, and the abundant black-and-white cartoon illustrations throughout will doubtless hook some reluctant readers.
The plot is completely crazy, but the story's well-told and involving. And the occasional gross-out humor will provoke giggles, such as when an alien beast sneezes, ""sending extraterrestrial snot everywhere. TJ stood there covered in slimy mucus."" The one real disappointment: The story does not fully conclude but ends on a cliff-hanger. A few pages later, a full page announces, ""The Action continues in Galaxy's Most Wanted,"" and teases the plot of the sequel (Into the Dorkness).","Parents need to know that Galaxy's Most Wanted, by John Kloepfer (of the Zombie Chasers series), ​is a fun, easy-to-read, heavily illustrated middle-grade series start. It's about a group of kids at a science and technology summer camp who, in their zeal to win the camp's prestigious Invention Convention contest, unwittingly attract a small, fuzzy, four-eyed, multi-armed alien named Mim to a nearby wooded lake. Mim seems friendly and even speaks English, but it turns out he isn't all that he seems. The book is written in a style sure to appeal to younger readers, with dollops of kid lingo, lots of amusing fake science, and a requisite amount of very mild gross-out humor (such as an alien beast sneezing mucus on a kid).

The Eighth Day,"Fun, exciting twist on the King Arthur legend.","Ever since Jax's father died and left him with Riley -- a boy barely out of high school who barely remembers to pay the electric bill -- Jax has been angry and confused. Why can't he live with his cousin? He doesn't even like Riley. Then Jax turns 13, and his confusion multiplies. He wakes up one morning and the whole town is deserted. Just gone. He rides around in a panic, breaks into Walmart for emergency supplies, and stacks them in his closet. Then the next day he wakes up and the world's going on again like nothing ever happened. A week later it happens again, but this time he runs into Riley, who has some serious explaining to do. Riley tells him he's a Transitioner like him: those descended from knights and magicians in King Arthur's time who live one extra day between Wednesday and Thursday. Some people transition from both realms, while some descendants of evil magicians live in the eighth day permanently. Jax has so many more questions, but Riley remains secretive. He's determined to train him just enough and send him to his cousin's house; too much information is dangerous. But each Transitioner has a family gift, and Jax is an inquisitor. He quickly learns about the secret prisoner next door and Riley's true identity. He also learns that there are others out there who want to use his gifts, and suddenly his curiosity puts him in serious danger.
","For a story that pits good vs. evil and could end in the apocalypse, THE EIGHTH DAY stays surprisingly light. The marketers of the book make comparisons to the Percy Jackson series. Jax isn't as quick-witted as Percy, but he's very earnest and makes relatable kid mistakes. He also steps up in a hurry when his friends are in trouble and thinks for himself. Readers will like him right away, and they'll grow to like Riley, as Jax does. As with any start to a series where a huge premise needs to be laid out, there are slow patches while Jax and readers gather information about Transitioners, those trapped in the eighth day, and where they came from and why. But once that's established (with enough mystery for future books), the story gets exciting and the pages fly by until the end.","Parents need to know that The Eighth Day is the first book in a planned trilogy that supposes that ancestors of evil magicians from King Arthur's time are imprisoned in a special time stream between Wednesday and Thursday and others, called Transitioners, can exist in both. Of course the evil magicians want out, and in a climactic scene pitting good against evil there's plenty of gunfire, bloodletting with daggers, one sad death, and many other deaths. But violence stays action-focused, not gory. Jax is kidnapped more than once and fears for his life, and there's much talk about his being an orphan and the families of other Transitioners like him having been wiped out by the enemy. All other content stays pretty mild. Kids will learn a bit about the King Arthur legend as well as the pyramids at Teotihuacan. Through Jax's folly, they'll also get a reminder to be careful online.

Seraphina,Richly conceived dragon fantasy with stellar young heroine.,"In the kingdom of Goredd, humans and shape-shifting dragons have endured an uneasy truce for four decades. But as the citizens prepare for the arrival of the leader of the dragon world, musician Seraphina Dombergh finds herself in a dangerous position. A member of the Goredd royal family has been murdered, and Seraphina finds herself drawn into the investigation, along with Prince Lucian Kiggs. As they search for answers that might prevent a civil war, Seraphina struggles with a potentially deadly secret -- that she herself is the product of an illegal marriage between her human father and her deceased dragon mother.
","SERAPHINA is a cleverly conceived and well-executed coming-of-age fantasy novel, rich in detail yet not overwhelming in its dragon lore. Author Rachel Hartman has created a singularly resourceful and empathetic heroine in young music teacher Seraphina Dombegh. The action scenes are well choreographed, but much of the plot's power comes from the emotional interplay between the novel's unusual and well-realized characters.

Chapter Two is Missing,Witty illustrations help bring funny mystery to life.,"CHAPTER TWO IS MISSING takes a standard mystery and turns it backward -- literally. The narrator is frantically looking for the missing chapter in his book, and the detective on the case is useless. The hapless book janitor (because every book needs a janitor to keep the pages clean and tidy) is even less help, and soon becomes the prime suspect. As letters go missing and random pages of other stories start appearing, our narrator is even more determined to solve the mystery himself.
","Creative, energetic, and full of fun, this mystery is a unique take on storytelling that will delight young readers. Chapter Two is Missing weaves words and illustrations together with silly banter to make the book more about the behind-the-scenes making of the book than the mystery itself.

This use of words as props in the story will remind emerging readers to pay attention to letters and sounds, and it's just plain fun to read.

Meanwhile, Leila, about the same age and fond of romantic stories, is having her own adventure, staying with her Pakistani dad's family in Lahore. Things get really interesting when each girl discovers a book titled The Exquisite Corpse whose pages are blank, until one girl impulsively adds a few words. Soon the book is writing its own chapters, with an occasional line or two from the girls, about a magic-obsessed 19th-century man, his violin-playing true love, and the evil guardian who threatens them. Sauerkraut, goats, butterflies, Kipling, and lots of surprising connections emerge in the ensuing TALE OF HIGHLY UNUSUAL MAGIC.
","This lively, funny tale from tween favorite Lisa Papademetriou delivers life lessons, spine-tingling adventure, and surprising connections as 12-year-old girls discover a magical book. Many a kid will relate to the non-magical issues that face the characters -- being dumped by your best friend, coping with a bully, trying to make sense of cultural differences -- and the benevolent forces that come into play as stories unfold and intertwine.
Some readers may find Papademetriou's helicopter-narrator tendency to jump in with side comments and explanations a bit much, but she manages a pretty irresistible mix of multiple cliffhangers, appealing characters, exotic adventure, and laugh-out-loud moments, such as this encounter with the local bully:
""Kai came from the big city, and she had a plan for almost everything. Her plan for people who wanted to rob her or threaten her was this: Make them think you're dangerously crazed. So when Pettyfer looked at her, she grabbed two fistfuls of her own hair and roared, then charged directly at him, screaming, 'Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yiiiiiiiiiiiii!'
""Pettyfer fell over backward, scrambled to his feet, and took off, tripping over his enormous, expensive shoes.""","Parents need to know that A Tale of Highly Unusual Magic involves two 12-year-old girls, one in Texas and the other in Pakistan.

"The Traitor's Game, Book 1","Royal intrigue, mild romance in action-packed fantasy.","In THE TRAITOR'S GAME, Kestra, who's 16, has been happily living away from her tyrannical father, second in power only to the king. Unexpectedly called back home, Kestra suspects that she'll have to face an arranged marriage when she gets there. But a rebel faction has other ideas about how Kestra can be useful, so they kidnap her while she's on the road. Using threats against the people she cares about, the rebels force Kestra to undertake a dangerous mission, one that will force her to betray her family. As her feelings for the rebel Simon grow, she becomes less and less sure of whom to trust, and whom to betray. With the fate of the kingdom at stake, Kestra will have to navigate a tangled web of dark secrets, including a shocking truth about herself.
","A veteran of fantasies for kids, author Jennifer A. Nielsen makes a switch to older middle-grade kids by adding a dash of romance to this action-packed fantasy adventure. The Traitor's Game offers intrigue, plot twists, secrets, magic, an evil king, a ruthless rebel leader, and two teen protagonists struggling to find their way through it all.
Kestra, 16, and Simon, a year or two older, take turns narrating the story. But instead of adding insight to events and motives, the voices of Kestra and Simon are too similar, and the reader may sometimes have to pause to remember who's talking now. The plot moves along at a good pace, with some predictability especially for teen readers, but some surprises along the way, too. Fantasy action/adventure fans will enjoy the rollercoaster ride to the open ending that doesn't satisfy but should leave them eager for the next installment.","Parents need to know that The Traitor's Game is the first in a planned fantasy trilogy by Jennifer A. Nielsen, author of the Ascendance and Mark of the Thief trilogies. Some of her series have been for kids ages 8 and 10.

There's lots of action and violence, some of it fantasy and some real-world, that isn't gory but does mention blood a few times. Torture with magical devices describes pain in some detail. Protagonist Kestra defies gender stereotypes by preferring weapons training and exploring the outdoors, but her character needs work when it comes to how she treats people and lets her temper get the better of her. It's free of profanity and any mention of alcohol, drugs, or tobacco, making it OK for tweens who are ready to add a dash of romance to their fantasy adventures.

But when the girl comes to, the only thing she remembers is that she's terrified of the man who comes looking for her claiming to be her father. Piper determines to help Anna escape the mysterious man, recover her memories, and make it home. They stow aboard a freight train heading to the capital and are quickly discovered by the mysterious young security guard. If she can fight off bandits and slavers, and earn the trust of the train's crew, she just might be able to get Anna to safety.
","Jayleigh Johnson makes a thrilling, inventive YA debut with THE MARK OF THE DRAGONFLY​. The fantasy world is richly imagined with convincing detail. The characters are well fleshed out, fully realized, and easy to relate to. She deftly combines elements of steampunk, fantasy creatures, and magical abilities. The adventure is exciting and well plotted to keep the pages turning for a wide range of ages and interests.","Parents need to know that The Mark of the Dragonfly is an exciting fantasy page-turner that's fine for preteens. The excitement comes partly from mild violence: The heroes are frequently in peril, a battle-like confrontation with bandits is described, there are a few physical struggles, a couple of times people are threatened with weapons, and blood is mentioned briefly four or five times. Sexual content is very mild: one kiss on the cheek and once Piper and Gee hold hands.

Crow Call,Tender father-daughter tale is best for school-aged kids.,"When a father returns from the fighting in World War II, his young daughter feels that she hardly knows him. To help rebuild their relationship, they go on a very special hunting trip complete with the gift of an over-sized plaid flannel shirt, two slices of cherry pie, and a crow call.
","The tenderness of this story will have special appeal to someone whose parent has been away for a while, though all readers will find it touching. The story is based on one from acclaimed author Lois Lowry's own life, and its sentiments seem very real.  The author does a masterful job of showing the development of the father-daughter relationship throughout the day, as through each small step they get closer and closer.  And, the artwork does a spectacular job of bringing a nostalgic tone to the pages as well as showing the changing emotions. 
 Using watercolor and acryl-gouache on paper, the artist has created nostalgic golden-gray scenes that look friendly and somewhat reminiscent of Andrew Wyeth paintings. In fact, he has dedicated his work to Wyeth, which seems quite appropriate. The full two-page spreads of the father and daughter walking through the woods on a slightly overcast and misty morning are especially breathtaking in their silence and sensitivity.","Parents need to know that this story, based on one from the author's own life, is of a father-daughter hunting trip.  Though the father carries a rifle, he does not use it. All of the hunting is done by the little girl and her crow call. Though the story finishes on a happy note, the ending is a bit unusual
and may be confusing to younger children. So, though the book itself is
aimed at a 4- to 8-year-old audience, it seems more appropriate for
kids in the older part of that range.

Bully,"Simple animal tale of bullying, empathy, and forgiveness.","A bunny, chicken and turtle ask a bull, ""Wanna play?"" He makes a mean faces and yells, ""No!"" and proceeds to insult each animal that comes near him, for example, calling the turtle a ""Slow poke!"" and telling a skunk, ""You stink!"" and a bee, ""Buzz off!"" But then a goat walks away, calling him, ""Bully!"" The bull considers this and it shakes him up -- he has a worried face and seems to tumble upside down as he realizes what he's done and understands how it feels to have someone call you nasty name. Humbly, with a tear in his eye, he says in a small voice, ""Sorry ..."" Then he asks the animals, ""Wanna play?"" And the turtle says, ""Okay,"" and the bunny, chicken, and turtle go off together.
","BULLY is a simple story that conveys all you need to know about bullying -- it's hurtful! -- and how having empathy for others can help you change your behavior in a positive way. It also shows that if you apologize for hurtful behavior, the ones you bullied will find it easier to forgive you, move on, and be friends.
Laura Vaccaro Seeger's simple story with bold images of animals rendered with thick black outlines and very few words effectively carries a nuanced message fit for the playground.","Parents need to know that Bully, by Laura Vaccaro Seeger, author-illustrator of the Caldecott Honor Book Green, shows once again that she can make a big point with very few words and bold images. This simple story shows how a bullying bull can change his ways once he understands how hurtful insults and name calling can be. And it shows kids that even bullies have feelings and can appreciate forgiveness after they apologize. It's a great, easy-to-grasp lesson in empathy without being preachy.

The Beef Princess of Practical County,"Moving, nontraditional farm story with heartland values.","Libby lives on a successful farm that includes cattle raising. Now that her older brother is off to college, it falls to her to raise two calves for the annual competition at the county fair. But she ignores her father's advice and names them, then finds herself growing attached to them. Since the purpose of the cattle competition is to sell them for a good price to someone who will eventually slaughter them for meat, Libby begins to rethink her life, becoming vegetarian and reconsidering whether showing cattle is something she wants to do.
","This is an unusual story in several ways that avoids the usual staples of modern farm stories. First, it takes place on a family farm that the family is not in danger of losing. They are not rich, but they are making a reasonable success of it. Second, there are no devastating droughts or evil bankers or greedy neighbors trying to grab their land. Instead they have traditions going back generations, and extended family, and good relations with the farming community in which they live.
	And third, this story of old-fashioned, heartland values is not written by someone who disapproves of them. The author lives on a farm herself, which nicely grounds the setting in reality, and does not need either dramatic histrionics, or a heroine who is eager to break free of her family and its traditions, to make a compelling, moving, and utterly engrossing story. Libby's difficulty letting go of her beloved calves is not portrayed as an aberration in an unfeeling family and community -- it is the norm, and part of the deep emotional backdrop of farming. An unusual and lovely story.
 From the Book:
	The Practical County Fair. It was nothing short of the best week of the year in Practical County. Everyone in the community pretty much stopped whatever they were doing to come to the fair. It was where for one week you could do what you couldn't the whole rest of the year. Like eat elephant ears. Or sit inside the Grange tent sipping milk shakes and catching up with the neighbors. For some folks, the fair was a chance to show off their finest whatever. To pick that perfect rose and display it in a vase to see if it could earn the blue ribbon. Or wow the judges with a deep-dish apple crumb pie from Great-grandma's secret recipe. For a handful of others, it wasn't about competing but about coming to see it all. The exhibits, the animal shows, the annual Beef Princess pageant, and the neighbor folks who were usually too busy working to visit.","Parents need to know that there is little to be concerned with here, and much to admire. Libby's family is a shining example of the kind of virtues we associate with family farmers.

Peeny Butter Fudge,Toothsome gift for zany grandmas to share with grandkids.,"When Mama leaves the kids with Nana, she also leaves a set of instructions for the day. But, when the door closes, all sorts of fun breaks loose. Though the three siblings and their grandmother follow the basics on the list, Nana embellishes it all with her special, playful touch. They race through the yard in potato sacks, feast on ham and biscuits, play imaginary games, make puzzles on the floor and, using a secret family recipe, whip up a batch of ""Peeny Butter Fudge."" The recipe for the fudge is printed on the last page, just in case some other grandma might want to give it a try.
","Kids will enjoy reading about the shenanigans of the three grandkids and their Nana. And grandmothers will love sharing the book with their grandkids. Both will love the rhyming, rhythmic text as well as the full-paged illustrations that truly capture what is so special the relationship between kids and their grandmas.

Full pages of very colorful oil-painted illustrations vividly express the chaos and energy of the day spent with Nana, as well as the love.

Grandma is checking out the schedule, the kids are beaming, and the reader senses that the fun is about to burst out onto the scene. Purple staircases that curve, doors  and lampshades that are a bit a-kilter show that Grandma's house is a place  where rules can be bent just enough to make things fun. Even when Nana and kids are caught in the midst of a cooking mess, their faces shine with a glow that promises that the mess will be easily forgiven. ","Parents need to know that this rhyming book, written by Noble Prize-winning author Toni Morrison and her son Slade, was inspired by her grandchildren, and her family fudge recipe.

An Assassin's Guide to Love and Treason,So-so historical fiction has romance and intrigue.,"AN ASSASSIN'S GUIDE TO LOVE AND TREASON tells of Kit, a young woman from Cornwall disguised as a boy and hiding out in London after her family's illegal Catholic practices are exposed. In London she meets with other Catholics and determines to avenge her father's death by killing the queen, using a part in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night as cover for the assassination attempt. Cast opposite Kit's Viola as Orsino, Toby Ellis has plenty to hide himself, not least of which is his growing attraction to Kit. Deception and disguise rule the day, but for how long? And what would become of Kit and Toby if their true selves were ever revealed?
","Fans of the genre will enjoy this historical fiction's romance and intrigue. It colorfully imagines the first staging of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night and the aged but no less awe-inpiring Queen Elizabeth I. Teens will be drawn to An Assassin's Guide to Love and Treason's story about disguise and deception, especially in how they relate to gender roles and the way we present ourselves to the world. Descriptions of locations may rely too much on readers being somewhat familiar with Elizabethan London -- they paint  clear-enough picture but aren't as truly immersive at they could be. The modernized language makes it easy to understand but lacks any real wit or sparkle.
The plot builds toward an exciting and fast-paced end, with a twist or two that will keep the pages turning. The end of Kit and Toby's story is pretty predictable, but satisfying especially for romance fans. Occasional strong language, non-gory violence, and themes of gender identity and sexual preference make it best for historical-fiction fans in high school or older.","Parents need to know that An Assassin's Guide to Love and Treason is romantic historical fiction by the author of The Witch Hunter series. The setting is London at the end of Elizabeth I's reign and involves a plot to assassinate her, so planning details and some non-gory but detailed instructions on how to kill someone with a knife are major plot points. Other violence involves fights and scuffles with knives, swords, punching, kicking, and choking. Blood's mentioned but not described in detail. The central romance is between Kit, a teen girl disguised as a boy, and Toby, an older teen who's attracted to both men and women but so far has only ever been in love with a man. Some kisses and caressing under clothing are described briefly. Profanity is rare but surprisingly strong, including ""f--k"" and ""s--t."" Alcohol is mentioned briefly in passing several times, and a few scenes take place in taverns and mention drinking ale. Tobacco is a novelty but Toby tries a cigar and it makes him feel sick.

Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever,Snowstorm tale lacks some punch but stays funny in 6th book.,"It's November, and Greg is already worried about making Santa's naughty list. To get info directly back to St. Nick, Greg's mom enlists the help of an elf doll that she calls Santa's Scout. That doesn't stop the mischievous misadventures, though, as Greg ices over someone's driveway (thinking a hose would be faster than shoveling) to make money to feed and clothe his online pet, pretends to use his mom's exercise game (but just sits and presses the buttons instead), and accidentally defaces school property with posters that stain the walls (and there's no way he's owning up to that). But when a blizzard strands Dad comfortably at a hotel and the rest of the family is stuck with limited food and no electricity, that's when the Christmas holidays really get interesting.
","Fans of the Wimpy Kid series could definitely do worse than having CABIN FEVER handy during cold winter weather. Greg's still up to no good in his own cluelessly funny way. Seeing how his family handles being stranded in a snowstorm is the highlight of the book. On the other hand, flashbacks about Greg's strange doll and the president's physical fitness test aren't as engaging and are too big a departure from the main story.
	As always, there are reminders that being a kid is so different today. Parents reading along will laugh about the sad state of Greg's playground (all the toys are removed for ""safety reasons""), the kids sneaking energy drinks when the school soda machine is removed, and that Greg gets rewarded with cybercash for watching his online pet watch commercials. While the later volumes in this series lack a little punch compared with the early ones, there's still plenty to laugh at and discuss with young readers.","Parents need to know that the sixth installment in the extremely popular Wimpy Kid series is the mildest yet. There's almost no violence except for a few barely bullied kids. And a couple of cartoons show Greg in the bathroom with his underwear on. Parents will probably be more concerned with Greg's behavior. As usual, he's not owning up to his mistakes, but he usually pays the price in excessive worry and/or (fair) punishment from his parents or the school. Parents may like the jabs at sites like Webkinz that get kids to hit their parents up for money -- a worthy topic of discussion -- and the safety restrictions at school that are so excessive that all of the playground equipment is removed.

Much of this graphic novel focuses on the sit-ins at Nashville department-store lunch counters in 1960 and how they led to a confrontation on the steps of the town's city hall.
","March is a powerful testament to the courage and resourcefulness of those who fought and died for equal rights. By writing about his childhood and education, John Lewis, with the scripting assistance of Andrew Aydin, makes the tale personal, while offering glimpses of larger-than-life figures such as Martin Luther King, Jr.

Ten Miles Past Normal,Quirky teen realizes normal is overrated in insightful book.,"In elementary school, living on a farm was a social boon for Janie Gorman. But now that she's a high school freshman, being Farm Girl means she's different. Weird different. She's the girl who comes to school smelling like goat poop, or with hay in her hair. She desperately wants to feel she's ""living large,"" as her best friend Sarah's older sister advocates. Janie and Sarah join the Jam Band, hoping to find a way to fit in and meet cute boys, and work together on an intriguing project about unsung heroes of the civil rights movement living in their community. What she learns helps put her embarrassment in perspective, and realize that normal is overrated.
","Independent-minded young teens will find kindred spirits to love and admire in this engaging novel. Janie's wry, self-aware voice is refreshingly high-spirited, even when she's at her most miserable. There isn't much drama to her coming-of-age story: no sweeping romances, no action-packed climax, no high-intensity decision point. But the small pieces come together for an insightful, authentic look at a teen girl figuring out what kind of life she wants to lead.
The characters' maturity may strain credibility a bit. Even the rebellious, grounded-for-staying-out-way-past-curfew-with-her-biker-boyfriend character is a stand-up kid with a strong moral compass. Janie also often seems much older than her years: She acknowledges strong feelings for a dear, older friend while swiftly realizing she isn't ready to date a man with his own apartment. Even so, her desire for acceptance is in tune with her age -- and will resonate with the tween and teen readers drawn into her quirky story.  ","Parents need to know that this coming-of-age story celebrates independent spirits and open hearts. And it helps teens keep
the everyday embarrassments of high school life in perspective. Janie is independent, smart, and -- despite her worries over fitting in -- confident. She is also politically aware and involved, as is her friend and family: Teens may learn a great deal about the civil rights struggle, social and
 environmental justice, and women in history. It's pretty tame for young adult fare -- no cursing, violence, or sexual content. The main character does go to jail, but it's a humorous, well-intentioned escapade.

But even after Lukas saves Elloren from an assassination attempt on the way to university (by Icaral assassins scared that she will turn out just like her grandmother), Elloren still refuses to defy her uncle. So Vyvian decides to make Elloren's life as miserable as possible for her. For starters, she refuses to pay Elloren's tithe, so Elloren has to work in the kitchens with Urisk laborers who despise her for looking like her grandmother, the cause of their oppression. But that's not the worst of it: Elloren's stuck in a dorm with the only two Icarals on campus. These bird-like creatures with black wings are said to curse you with their stare, and on Elloren's first night she's locked in the closet with one of her new roomies scratching on the door, threatening to kill her.
","This overlong but engaging tale highlighting racial tension and prejudice between the Gardnerians -- the ruling magical ""chosen people"" -- and other oppressed races resonates with our times. Civically engaged teen readers looking for parallels to today's social movements and the world's ongoing strife will find much food for thought here. Those who'd rather focus on the characters will enjoy Elloren and feel for her struggle to stay true to herself, find romance, and find her place in the world. Her naiveté and fear of other races at the beginning of The Black Witch is understandable given her environment, and her growth as a character into someone who senses her own power to change things, with or without a wand in her hand, is admirable.
This series is off to a fine start but could have used one last purge of 100 pages or so. There are too many scenes in the kitchen, too many furtive glances between Elloren and Yvan -- we get it, he's mysterious and hot -- and there's too much time setting up Elloren's first few horrible days at the university. With Cassandra Clare's fantasies sometimes clocking in at 700-plus pages, most editors probably don't bat an eye when YA books overdo. But new writers and their editors would do well to take their time to make a story truly great.","Parents need to know that The Black Witch is the first book in a thought-provoking fantasy series. Through this world on the brink of a race war between Gardnerians (the closest to humans, with all the power), lupines, the brightly colored Urisk, elves, selkies, and bird/human-like Icarals, debut author Laurie Forest examines prejudice, privilege, and even how to study history -- from many perspectives beyond the dominant culture's take. Prepare for a few bloody moments, mostly with creatures like dragons and Icaral assassins stabbed through the heart with swords or getting their heads twisted off. When Gardnerians get injured -- with broken bones and stabbings -- they are magically healed. A selkie (seal/human-like shape-shifter) is abused by a man who held her captive, with talk of selkies being rounded up and sold as sex slaves for men. Other animals are abused, too: A dragon is shown after a heavy beating, barely alive (with talk that dragons are broken by letting them bond to a baby dragon and then killing that dragon in front of them; and a beloved pet chicken is found hung. The rest of the content is fairly mild for teen-focused fare: a few kisses and some inflammatory rumors about lupine mating behavior.

"Broken Pride: Bravelands, Book 1","Intense, sometimes violent start to rich, vivid animal saga.","In the region of the African plains known as the Bravelands, young lion cub Fearless' life is shattered when a treacherous rival kills his father, the pride leader, and Fearless must flee the BROKEN PRIDE for his life. He winds up taken in by a flock of baboons and tries desperately to fit in, but despite his best efforts and his baboon friend Thorn, he's never quite accepted, and he never stops worrying about his mother and sister. Thorn has problems of his own -- he's in love with Berry, and she's in love with him, but they can't be together because they're of different social classes. Meanwhile, orphan elephant Sky discovers she can see how an animal died when she examines its bones -- a skill her grandmother, the ruling Great Mother of the Bravelands animals, puts to good use.
As the multivolume series gets under way, the young animals face many challenges and tests of character as they contend with betrayal, cruelty, and murder from others in their communities.
","Erin Hunter travels to the plains of Africa in her latest animal fantasy series, which follows a young lion, a baboon, and an elephant through adventures sure to thrill current fans and win new ones. Some of the situations and descriptions -- murdered parents, adults trying to kill youngsters, predators stalking and devouring prey -- may be too much for sensitive kids. But there's a lot to love in Broken Pride's young heroes, its colorful world, and its positive messages about family, friendship, and being true to yourself while helping your loved ones.","Parents need to know that best-selling writing/editing syndicate ""Erin Hunter"" (the Warriors series), is in top form in Broken Pride, the first volume in an animal fantasy series featuring a young lion, a baboon, and an elephant on the African savanna. The descriptions are vivid, the characters appealing (or appalling, in the case of villains), the story exciting, and the stage set for many adventures and relationships in volumes to come. Also the vocabulary is rich, as are the details about the plants and animals who call the Bravelands home. There are plenty of positive lessons about family, friends, teamwork, negotiation, and coexistence. The story may be too upsetting for younger or more sensitive readers: Besides vivid accounts of predators killing and eating prey, it includes several murders, including the treacherous killing of a lion cub's father, as well as mutilation, fights, and other mayhem.

Keeker and the Sneaky Pony,A great choice to keep new readers in the saddle.,"Catherine Corey Keegan Keeker, otherwise known as Keeker, has always wanted a pony. Finally the dream comes true when Plum the Shetland pony arrives at her family's farm. At first she spends time with Plum to get to know her. Plum finds her nosy and wishes she would leave her alone. Keeker struggles with catching Plum, putting on the tack, and then out on a trail. They share adventures and in the process learn to trust each other.
","With its simple sentence structure, easy-to-read language, and interesting characters and story line, this book is a great tool to push the new reader along. It will appeal to many young readers, particularly those who dream of owning a pony. Six short chapters are illustrated with delightful curlicue, thin-lined drawings on every page, helping the reader follow the plot and learn even more about the characters. And for kids who finish this book asking for their own ponies, there are also a few pages of pony facts describing the time-intensive responsibilities involved.
Author Hadley Higginson, who grew up on farm, clearly understands young girls like 8-year-old Keeker, who desperately wants a pony. She also gets animal behavior, and in giving the pony Plum a voice, she cleverly shows the animal as mischievous and a bit full of herself. Plum wants to be free, run, eat blackberries -- kids can understand this perspective, too. So readers will root for both Keeker and Plum to get what they want. It's a great lure to keep readers wanting to know what happens next.","Parents need to know that this book, the first in the Keeker series, will draw in emergent readers, especially horse lovers. It includes positive messages on caring for and building trust with animals. A girl is tossed off a pony, but not injured.

Timmy Failure: We Meet Again,Sentimental heart beats beneath goofy humor.,"Timmy Failure is poised for greatness, certain he's on the brink of becoming the biggest name in international detective work. Achieving greatness would be easier if he wasn't on academic probation, with a hard-nosed principal just waiting for him to mess up. And if his mother wasn't making him play baseball -- and dating his coach. And if he didn't have to do a massive nature project with his archrival. He'd solve all these problems, however, if he could get his hands on the legendary Miracle Report, a nature project that earned an A+++++. It would secure his position as the greatest detective ever … and perhaps he could save his grade. ","TIMMY FAILURE: WE MEET AGAIN stands out in a crowded field of funny graphic novels targeted to boys by infusing the story with moving, tender touches. It's very funny, full of clever jokes and outrageous scenarios, and enjoyable to read. But there's more going on here: Timmy propels himself through life (often riding on his mom's Roomba) with little consideration for others, and it's remarkable to see how much classmates and adults in his life try to connect with him. Author-cartoonist Stephen Pastis deploys a subtlety that's lacking in other books in this genre -- Timmy may be the star here, but the people around him are living their own stories, and Pastis offers glimpses into their struggles and successes.
Like Greg in the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series and Nate in the Big Nate books, Timmy isn't always a likable hero: He's rude to friends and mean to imagined enemies, and he strives to be the center of attention. He creates conflict where there is none. Sensitive kids may understand and relate to his sometimes odd behavior. Pastis reveals the vulnerability beneath Timmy's prickly persona, offering a lesson in empathy amid the engaging humor.","Parents need to know that Timmy Failure: We Meet Again is the third in the popular comic graphic series by Stephan Pastis, creator of the nationally syndicated comic strip Pearls Before Swine. It's full of genuinely good-hearted kids and adults -- though Timmy seems morally rudderless. Thoughtful readers will pick up on clues as to why Timmy behaves so poorly. And if they don't, Timmy's supposed rchrival points it out bluntly: He's lonely. He desperately wants to be appreciated, and he worries about anything coming between him and his mother, whether it's a sleepover or her latest boyfriend. The story tackles complicated issues, particularly school-wide rumors about plagiarism. Timmy's mom dates two men who play large roles in Timmy's life, and the story touches on her frustration at work. Timmy shares an unexpected kiss with a classmate, and he encounters his mom kissing her date. A few fat jokes involve an overweight friend who likes snacks and breaks something by sitting on it. The publisher recommends this series for ages 8 and up, but we recommend 10 and older because of the vocabulary and nuanced themes.

Matt swipes a strange device from their backpack, setting in motion a wild pursuit complete with disguises, kidnapping, unlikely alliances, and international intrigue. Wyatt would like to be a hero but finds himself following the lead of his longtime crush, a ""hot girl"" with a keen sense of adventure.

For all the implausibility of the plot, Barry is right at home in the world of 13-year-olds. The class dutifully treks from one place where ""something historic happened"" to the next, and, as on ny field trip, all the interesting stuff happens in between: For most of the class, the most exciting part of the trip is speculating why Suzana is spending so much time with the nerds. There are elements of real danger (kidnappers, Secret Service agents, missiles), but they lack teeth -- it’s more slapstick Pink Panther than Mission Impossible. ","Parents need to know that The Worst Class Trip Ever is a funny, suspenseful story from humor writer Dave Barry (Peter and the Starcatchers).

A ""hot girl"" turns out to be a bold, resourceful adventurer, and the accidental hero finds he's capable of incredible feats when left with few other options. The two teacher chaperones are comically clueless. The only sour note is some stereotyping: the ""weird guys"" from a fictional Middle Eastern country, speaking clipped English; a Nigerian taxi driver enraged by a shorted fare; references to another taxi driver speaking ""Martian""; a Cuban mom prone to verbal and physical outbursts.

These life stories begin with a woman's name and what she loves or does. They highlight an array of fields, including STEM, writing, fashion, sports, politics, activism, comedy, and more and are from a variety of countries. The soft-hued digital illustrations depict the subject in her element: competing in her sport, writing, performing onstage, and so on. The closing pages remind readers that though some of these women faced dire circumstances for pursuing their dreams or their rights, they all refused to give up and achieved greatness.

"It Ain't So Awful, Falafel",Relatable story of Iranian girl in U.S. who wants to fit in.,"When her family moves to Newport Beach, California, right before she starts sixth grade, Zomorod is so desperate to fit in that she changes her name to Cindy. She's embarrassed by her Iranian family: Her depressed mother won't learn English and doesn't grasp American social etiquette, her engineer dad talks only about oil in thickly accented English, and her family doesn't celebrate American holidays. After a rocky start, Cindy has great friends and feels she's blending in (though she's often mistaken for Mexican). But the Iranian Revolution and hostage crisis threaten everything in their lives, and the family faces threats. Cindy no longer feels welcome in America -- but could she return to such a changed Iran?
","The 1979 revolution in Iran may seem like ancient history to middle schoolers today, but this amiable novel makes that tense, world-changing event real and -- most importantly -- relatable. Author Firoozeh Dumas draws on her own childhood for IT AIN'T SO AWFUL, FALAFEL, and she captures the spirit and voice of a young girl whose normal middle school anxieties are deepened by a sometimes unbridgeable gulf between her nd her very American peers.
Cindy and her family are the emotional core of the story: Cindy's friends, though kind and steadfast, are barely developed. Her girlfriends and kindly neighbors are primarily used to prop up dialogue explaining developments in Iran. Dumas clearly describes the cultural and political changes in Iran and the nation's complicated history with the U.S., and she affectingly portrays the countless ways newcomers to America can struggle to feel at home. It raises issues about the immigrant experience that still resonate today.","Parents need to know that It Ain't So Awful, Falafel is about an immigrant family from Iran that faces both kindness and cruel harassment amid the drama of the Iran hostage crisis that began in 1979.

She describes some of the violence in Iran, poignantly showing how distressing it was for people living in the United States who were worried about friends and family back in Iran. Not only are the bullies outnumbered by upstanders in this story, but characters who engage in mean or petty behavior are presented with some complexity and insight.

Then she discovers she’s a \""free agent,\"" one of the Leopard People with powerful magical abilities. As she undergoes juju training, she begins to enjoy her newfound powers. She can stand up to the bullies at school and turn herself invisible; she can even play soccer in the daytime.

Sunny doesn’t always make the right choices, but she is spunky and likable, and readers will share her enthusiasm as she goes through her magical training.
","Fantasy fans will enjoy familiar themes in a new and original setting. Just like any young magician, Sunny must learn the rules of her magic and pay the price when she breaks them -- such as when she uses her ""spirit face"" to scare a bullying classmate. Readers might be tempted to compare the Leopard People’s magical village of Leopard Knocks to Diagon Alley and the Zuma Festival to the Quidditch World Cup, but beyond these surface similarities to the Harry Potter series, the world and society of the Leopard People is truly unique. Sunny’s joy at learning that she is gifted in juju is palpable and makes up for the sometimes slow buildup to the culminating action-packed scenes.","Parents need to know that Sunny, the heroine of this fantasy set in Nigeria, is teased at school and called an akata, a derogatory term for African Americans. When the class misbehaves, the teacher hits her students with a switch, and Sunny is beat up by classmates.

Hoping to make enough money to move out, Deanna takes a job at a local pizza place, even though Tommy works there too. Meanwhile she is dealing with her brother, who has become a teen father; his girlfriend, who takes off, leaving them with the baby; and her changing feelings about her only two remaining friends.
","The feelings and motivations of all of the characters, but especially of Deanna, are subtle and complex here in a way that most young adult novels aren't. For instance, Deanna is repelled by Tommy, angry at him, contemptuous, a bit frightened, and yet still attracted to him. Tommy himself is a lout, but not evil, and with complex feelings of his own. Every character and every relationship gives the reader much to recognize and think about.
The theme of forgiveness is similarly subtle and complex here -- this is not an author to hit the reader over the head with The Point. Forgiveness is something all the characters confront in one way or another, and those who can manage it do it for themselves more than for others. It becomes an act of survival, not sainthood.","Parents need to know that this is a book about a teen who had sex when she was 13. There are no descriptions of sex, but many sexual references. Teens also smoke, including marijuana. There is quite a lot of profanity, including ""f--k.""

"UnSouled: Unwind Dystology, Book 3",Teens flee organ harvesters in action-packed installment.,"On the run from ProActive Citizenry, the Juvenile Authority, and vengeful parts pirates, Connor and Lev careen across the Southwest looking for a woman, nearly erased from history, who may hold the key to stopping \""unwinding\"" forever. When Lev is critically injured, they and a new companion, the odd but talented Grace, must depend on the kindness of others to survive. Meanwhile, Cam, the boy made completely of harvested tissue, continues his pursuit of Risa, who betrayed him.
","If you're looking for a conclusion to the Unwind ""trilogy,"" you won't find it in UNSOULED. But as an action-filled ride through a complex sci-fi setting, this installment probably won't disappoint you. Author Neal Shusterman keeps the suspense cranked high, and the characters in his twisty plots have more depth than many of their science-fiction counterparts. Good guys and villains alike have multiple and sometimes conflicting motivations. The character development adds a sense of realism to the somewhat unlikely science-fiction scenario. The ending leaves readers ready for a rousing series conclusion, whenever it might arrive.","Parents need to know that UnSouled is the third volume, but not the conclusion, of the ongoing Unwind ""dystology."" Set in a world where ""harvesting"" the organs of rebellious teenagers is normal, it raises compelling questions about medical ethics and free will. Violent episodes include beatings, stabbings, gunshots, lynching, and impalement with a farm tool. There's mild profanity and vulgar language -- occasional ""a--hole,"" ""damn,"" ""hell,"" ""bitch,"" ""piss,"" and ""crap."" An implicit sexual subtext avoids explicit detail: One character has amorous groupies; another impregnates three of his followers. Drug use is minimal and not always voluntary; one character is forced to smoke a mixture of cannabis and tranquilizer, and another ingests chocolate suffused with pot.

Sidekicked,Smart coming-of-age tale costumed as superhero adventure.,"Andrew Bean is in the most exclusive club at school: H.E.R.O., a secret program to train superhero sidekicks. Drew has extraordinary senses, but that's about it. His mentor, the Titan, is a reclusive legend too burdened by booze and misery to aid him. His best friend, Jenna, is oblivious to his timid romantic feelings. Then a prison break heralds the return of the Dealer, a villain thought to have been killed by the Titan years ago. As the Dealer and the three Jacks draw near, superheroes begin to disappear, and their sidekicks are in peril. Drew desperately tries to rouse the Titan -- to help himself, even if he won't help anyone else. Left fumbling on his own, Drew begins doubting his loyalties as the line between good and bad blurs.
\
 
","SIDEKICKED is a terrific addition to the kid-living-a-fantastic-double-life genre, delivering plenty of action while deftly exploring themes of morality, loyalty, identity, and consequences. John David Anderson maintains suspense with unpredictable twists and turns, narrating with 13-year-old Drew's wry voice. Already plagued with self-doubt, Drew is let down by his hero and should-be mentor, a friend, and even his clueless parents, who do all they can for him based on what little they know.
 Author John David Anderson digs deep into the nature of good and evil and how the two can get confused. The Titan's fall delves into the importance of personal responsibility -- and the danger of taking it too far. And, of course, there's the question of what qualifies as true heroism. ","Parents need to know that Sidekicked contains several action-packed fighting scenes, given that it's a novel about superheroes and villains. It has some heavy themes and grapples with questions of morality and consequences. A former superhero has become a pitiful alcoholic who's most often found occupying a barstool. The young teen hero uses his special talent to cheat on a test, eavesdrop on a mentor, and help a friend try to pick up girls. He later steals cars while trying to save someone in danger. He's uncomfortable with lying to his parents to protect his secret identity.

Joshua Dread,Hilarious saga of middle-schooler with supervillain parents.,"Sixth grade is no day at the beach to begin with, but it's worse for young JOSHUA DREAD, who's spent his childhood landing in a new town with a new name every time someone starts to suspect his harmless-looking parents' secret identity as supervillains. HIs parents start the story by trying to destroy the world, only to be foiled by arch-rival Captain Justice -- a scenario that's been going on as long as Joshua can remember. Also, Joshua has just discovered that he has a superpower of his own. As he and his friends Milton and Sophie cope with hazards from hostile mutant plants to brain-eating zombies, not to mention corporate greed, in venues ranging from middle school to a trade show for supervillains, unexpected alliances and life lessons emerge.
","Adults and kids will have many laugh-out-loud moments as Joshua and his friends face assorted perils and surprise discoveries in this fast-moving, irresistible book. They may be different moments, though (to fully appreciate the Vile Fair, for example, it helps to be a veteran of trade shows). Fans of brain-eating zombies and man-eating plants will enjoy the role of monsters in defining the characters and furthering the plot. Along the way, readers share Joshua's discoveries that even parents with superpowers have a full range of strengths and weaknesses, that even supervillains love their children, and that you may have more in common with your enemies than you thought.","Parents need to know that Joshua Dread is full of monsters, mutants, and zombies, which isn't so surprising when the sixth-grade narrator's parents are secretly supervillains. The story starts with the Dread Duo attempting to destroy the world, only to be foiled by arch-enemy Captain Justice, a  superhero with a knack for self-promotion. Comic mayhem ensues, complete with a lot of annihilated robots and engines of destruction, and lots of characters who are apparently killed only to reappear later in the action. As he tries to find his way in this wacky world, Joshua also deals with the challenges of friendship, family and loyalty, not to mention the sudden discovery of his own superpower.

Invisible Ghosts,Cute but predictable teen romance … with ghosts.,"In INVISIBLE GHOSTS, Rose Asher is grappling with grief and guilt five years after her brother Logan's death. She's also dealing with his ghost every day when she gets home from school. It's a secret she can't share with anyone, because she's not sure whether the ghost is real or in her head. Either way, she's happy to spend afternoons watching their favorite shows and hanging on the couch with him. At school, however, Rose has withdrawn from her old group of friends and makes do socially with a group of girls she doesn't connect with. Jaime, a cute boy she knew years ago, moves back, throwing her social life and her relationship with Logan for a loop. Jamie's own secrets further complicate things. As Rose figures out that she needs to live her life to the fullest and plan for her future, all her relationships go through serious growing pains.
","In this sweet but tepid romance, a teen girl hangs out with her brother's ghost and struggles mightliy with the complications and fallout resulting from the unusual situation. Invisible Ghosts offers an interesting premise in using the ghost as a way of showing that Rose is having a hard time moving on after her brother Logan's death. (He died from an allergic reaction to bee stings when he went looking for her after they had an argument.) How can she grow up and move on when he's stuck at age 15? Every advancement she achieves is a reminder of the life he never got to have.
The story starts to feel a little forced when love interest Jamie enters the picture with his own secrets, and it falters further under shallow characters and a predictable storyline. Repetitive phrasing and characters that completely drop from sight drag it down a little more. However, author Robyn Schneider does a good job with the teen dialogue and banter. She also nails teen girl social dynamics, especially when she shows that many young women dim their personalities and fly under the radar to avoid scrutiny in high school. Overall, this is a light, fun read, especially for teens who are into ""shipping"" fictional characters.","Parents need to know that Invisible Ghosts by Robyn Schneider (Extraordinary Means, The Beginning of Everything) is a combination light romance and ghost story about a teen who's struggling after the death of her brother. The book centers on Rose's regular visits with her brother's ghost, her budding relationship with a boy at school, and the complications that arise from both of those relationships. Issues  around grief, guilt, and how to move on from loss factor largely into the story. Other important topics include dating and friendships. Most of the characters display typical teen behavior, such as lying to parents, some drinking, and making out, but there's nothing too extreme here. Characters swear rarely (""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" and ""crap""). Teens drink at three different parties, but no one is shown drunk.

Belzhar,"Girl uses fantasy world to recover in moody, moving book.","Jam's parents send her to a school for ""fragile"" students so she can recover from a trauma. She tells her new friends only that she had a boyfriend who suddenly died. At the Wooden Barn, she ends up in an exclusive English class with four other deeply troubled students. where she is told she will read The Bell Jar and also write in a journal. But when she starts writing in the journal her teacher gave her, something miraculous happens: She's transported to a mysterious place where she can be with Reeve again and relive their moments together. But, as their journals start to fill up, Jam and the other students wonder whether they'll ever be able to visit the place they call Belzhar (named to sound somewhat like ""the bell jar"") or be their unscathed selves ever again.
","Written in the same vein as books such as The Perks of Being a Wallflower, BELZHAR deals beautifully with sensitive teens trying to cope with traumas that have left them forever altered. Beautifully written with great significant details, it will inspire great empathy in readers who will care deeply about the teen characters who have to face the realities of what happened to them (versus the stories they've told themselves) and accept the new realities of their lives.
Last-minute plot twists will surprise readers and force them to rethink the protagonist's tragedy in a whole new way. Many readers will want to read the book one more time once they finish, and it's rich enough to deserve that second read. Though Belzhar has fantasy elements, this is a better choice for realistic fiction lovers; the magical elements are never fully explained.","Parents need to know that Belzhar, by Meg Wolitze​r, is a coming-of ge novel about teens who've experienced trauma: A character's friend accidentally sets fire to a barn, killing all the goats inside; a girl is paralyzed when her drunk mom drives into a wall; a girl’s younger brother is abducted; and protagonist Jam reveals to her new friends that her boyfriend died suddenly. There's some kissing and talk of sex. Jam's friend's boyfriend carries around a condom in his pocket; at a party, Jam walks in on a couple hooking up and another group playing strip poker; and Jam's roommate has a girlfriend, much to her girlfriend's mother's dismay. One of the boys in Jam's English class says that he saw a porn tape of his father having sex with another woman. There's some swearing, drinking, and marijuana smoking. In the end, Jam slowly starts to find reasons to participate in life, including helping friends, looking after her younger brother, and even trying to love again.

Palace of Spies,"Lots of history, little emotional depth in palace intrigue.","In England during the reign of George I, 16-year-old Peggy finds herself betrothed to a stranger who's quickly revealed as a really bad guy. When she refuses to marry, her guardian uncle throws her out of the house with only the clothes on her back. Turning to someone she hopes can help her learn about her past lands her smack in the midst of palace intrigue, disguised as a lady in waiting to the Princess of Wales. To navigate the halls of power, she'll have to solve a murder and learn who her true friends are.
","In PALACE OF SPIES, Sarah Zettel, author of the American Fairy trilogy, leaves fantasy behind and instead focuses on palace intrigue, blackmail, and murder -- a change that's not for the better. Although the story's rich in historical detail (ever tried on a mantua?), its emotional engagement remains pretty shallow. Characters lack the kind of telling details that would make us truly care about them. The even pacing reveals secrets slowly; then comes an over-the-top violent confrontation at the end.
History-loving kids will find plenty to enjoy about a world where everything hinges on who said what and who was seen with whom. An enjoyable-enough light read, Palace of Spies offers lots of interesting tidbits that don't quite make an emotionally satisfying meal.","Parents need to know that Palace of Spies, by American Fairy Trilogy author Sarah Zettel, features courtly intrigue from early 1700s England and provides a lot of historical detail. Two incidents have a strong emotional impact on 16-year-old Peggy: a sexual assault and seeing two people having sex. Violence is infrequent and mild until the end, when fighting, killing, and blood are described in detail. A few uses of ""bitch"" and ""whore"" are the main examples of strong language.

The Upper Class,"Good friendship tale, but sex, drugs, labels, too.","Laine is from old-money Connecticut. Loud Nikki wears gold jewelry, glittery eye shadow, and swears like a sailor. The girls -- roommates at an expensive boarding school -- don't immediately bond; in fact Laine doesn't even tell Nikki that she's being targeted by the school's alpha girl, who wants her to drop out. But their troubled pasts and struggles to find themselves eventually bring them together.
","You've heard the story before: Two opposites form an unlikely friendship at a posh boarding school; what makes this story unique is that its characters seem very vivid -- and vulnerable. They both have deep family issues, and encounter new problems as well: Nikki falls for a bad boy, who gets expelled, and Laine's eating disorder threatens her field hockey scholarship -- and future college career.
Their prep school setting feels equally real. The authors went to boarding school together, and it's clear that they loved it, warts and all. Don't be fooled by the book's cheap packaging or its formulaic set-up. Readers will be truly moved by both girls' stories -- and appreciate their growing friendship.","Parents need to know that younger teen girls who are into all of the ""popular girl"" series books will want to read this, but it will slap them with all the same raw, adult themes that make these books guilty pleasures. Teens drink a lot, smoke -- and even snort cocaine. One protagonist loses her virginity in the school library; another has an eating disorder. There is swearing, lots of label name-dropping -- and even some pretty disturbing hazing.

"The Quest Begins: Seekers, Book 1",Slow start to series about talking bears on quest.,"A polar bear cub in an era of disappearing ice loses her mother to orca whales. A grizzly cub's mother abandons him after his sickly brother dies. And a black bear cub, who lives in a zoo, escapes to find the grizzly after meeting his captured mother. All three must learn to survive in the wild on their own, and all three are drawn by the North Star toward a mysterious fate. Includes maps of the bears' journeys.
","Erin Hunter, the pseudonym for a group of writers who created the various Warriors fantasy series about feral cats, takes her time getting this new series about bears started. By the end not all of the characters have even met, the quest referred to in the title is undefined, the fantasy element only starts to come out, and a real plot has not yet emerged, though it is hinted at. What you get instead is a vivid and realistic portrayal of the lives of different types of bears in a time of global warming, shrinking habitat, and human intrusion, from the points of view of bear cubs who think and communicate with each other like humans, even as they act like bears.
The chapters rotate among the three main characters as their stories gradually begin to converge. Though there's much wandering and only hints of the story to come, readers will be gripped by the fascinating and often cruel lives of the bears, and by the vivid settings. A cliffhanger ending, along with the mysterious hints about what is to come will leave young readers hungry for more. Warriors fans looking for more of the same will be disappointed, but animal lovers will find this story's mix of anthropomorphism and realism appealing, and Hunter may find an entirely new audience.","Parents need to know that the world of the bears is a cruel and sometimes bloody one, in which bears fight with each other and are shot by humans.

"City of Heavenly Fire: The Mortal Instruments, Book 6",Fans won't mind length of mature series send-off.,"Sebastian, Clary's brother who was made evil with demon blood by their father, Valentine, has some truly diabolical plans in store. Shadowhunters in the city of Alicante are shivering in their combat boots as Sebastian ransacks institutes all over the world, forcing Shadowhunters to drink from the Infernal Cup. The contents turn them evil and soulless -- perfect additions to Sebastian's growing army. No one's willing to believe that Shadowhunters they once knew and loved can't be turned back -- until they face them in battle and more Shadowhunters die at their hands. There's nothing Sebastian fears anymore except for Jace, who, through some magic of Clary's ""stele"" (a blade that carves magic symbols), has heavenly fire running in his veins. Sebastian knows this is the one thing that can kill him, which is why he demands that Clary and Jace join his side or the whole world will be destroyed. They have two days to decide. But no way is Jace waiting around to be claimed. He gathers up Clary and their friends Isabelle, Alec, and Simon and seek him out where his power is strongest. It's a path that, not surprisingly, leads them straight to hell.
","This YA fantasy is too long -- but amid far too much of the characters' internal dialogue nd remembrances of the good and bad times of the past five books, it's got  satisfying end for fans. Guess what will finally happen with Clary and Jace? And for Alec and Magnus it's nice to see such a dramatic and complex story line for gay characters who usually get the briefest of mentions, if they exist at all. Simon's life takes a surprising turn in the tense climax -- stay tuned. The stakes are about as high as they can be for both the characters whom readers love and the whole world. This is an exciting send-off. But this isn't good-bye, not really. Cassandra Clare carefully introduces new characters for her next series, The Dark Artifices. As Emma grows up, she'll be another strong heroine -- just like Clary and Tessa.  ","Parents need to know that Cassandra Clare's Mortal Instruments series has always been meant for more mature teen readers. But the sexual content is a bit more mature in City of Heavenly Fire and the previous installment, City of Lost Souls, than in the others. Here main characters have sex for the first time (with a condom), and other couples -- straight and gay -- do plenty of kissing and rolling around together. The series continues to be bloody and violent, with some truly gory moments -- guts spilling, heads rolling -- and some profoundly sad ones, such as when a 12-year-old boy must kill his own father because his father drank out of a cup that ""turned"" him evil. There are more sad deaths, mostly by stabbing, and some battle scenes and talk of massacres. The older teen characters drink wine together. They also fight alongside one another, showing loyalty, friendship, and bravery -- big themes of the series. Clare includes a gay relationship with all the complexity and then some of a straight one -- which is rare, especially for a fantasy series. She also introduces her first autistic character, Tiberius, who will figure more prominently in her follow-up series, The Dark Artifices.

Winterhouse,Perfectly set bookish mystery with some spooky stuff.,"In WINTERHOUSE, Elizabeth returns from school to find her home at her aunt and uncle's locked, a small bag of clothes hanging on the door, $3, and a bus ticket. Her guardians had been given money by a mysterious benefactor to be used on a holiday vacation for them and a trip to the Winterhouse hotel for Elizabeth. Rather than question a stranger's intentions, they take off without notice. They're those kinds of guardians. When Elizabeth arrives at the remote luxury hotel, she can hardly believe her luck:  room all to herself, a huge library to explore, oodles of winter sports to try, and even a new friend, Freddy, also there by himself, and he's  huge fan of word puzzles, too. It's all shaping up to be an idyllic holiday until Elizabeth finds a book in the library, on instinct, hidden on a high shelf. She sneaks it back to her room without checking it out, not knowing why. It's called A Guide for Children and is filled with games, codes, and puzzles. Harmless fun, Elizabeth thinks, until the hotel owner, Norbridge, tells her about a book his family has been anxious to find for generations. A key to a family secret. Elizabeth is sure that her stolen book is not the one he means, until she spots a few large silver letters on the book she didn't notice before. And when she tries to show them to Freddy, she realizes they are letters only she can see.
","With the perfect setting of a snow-covered, remote luxury hotel, this is one of those books you want to jump into and never leave, even when spooky stuff starts going down. It's easy to dream about your days at Winterhouse, helping with a giant puzzle, eating lots of homemade candy, going to lectures on famous explorers, skiing around a frozen lake. And if you're really curious, like Elizabeth, you can stay busy exploring the dramatic family history that goes with the place. It's a special book that grounds the reader so well in the environment and makes you want to explore as much as the characters do. First-time author Ben Guterson really gets this right.
Guterson also builds in a whole lot of mystery in one story, making you wonder which direction you'll eventually be led. With the focus on code-breaking, some creepy booksellers, and word puzzles early on, the scary place the story ends up will probably surprise you. It's not a bad place, just a strange shift in tone. It quickly shifts back, however, to a sweeter note at the story's end. New ties are formed and promises are made to bring the whole gang back together. Escapist readers are sure to be excited about two more trips to Winterhouse.","Parents need to know that Winterhouse is the first book in a trilogy set in a remote fancy hotel. A bookish girl named Elizabeth travels there alone for the winter holidays. The mystery begins focused on puzzles and code-breaking, but shifts into spooky stuff. Spoiler alert (regrettable, but so parents grasp the level of scariness Winterhouse builds up to, since tweens' abilities to handle scary stuff vary greatly): There are curses, sudden noises or things falling, lights that chase people, and also a coffin that makes banging noises. And -- don't tell this part -- an evil ghost tries to come back to life and kill with witchy powers. No one is seriously hurt. Elizabeth talks of her parents who died when she was 4 nd recalls being mistreated by her aunt and uncle. She also talks a lot about her love of reading and word puzzles. She does word puzzles with a young inventor named Freddy and visits a giant library in the hotel staffed by a librarian from Uganda.

Skyward,Sci-fi space adventure off to a high-flying start.,"At the beginning of SKYWARD, would-be space pilot Sansa wants nothing more than to prove that she's capable of battling the alien hordes that want to destroy the human inhabitants of the planet Detritus. Everyone believes that Sansa's father was a coward and a traitor, but she's determined to demonstrate that they're mistaken and that she'll be able to restore her family's honor. Her biggest advantage is the discovery of a better spacecraft abandoned generations ago. If Sansa can refurbish M-Bot, she and her compatriots stand a chance of fending off extinction.
","Space battles don't always work well in prose, but this sci-fi adventure adds a human dimension that will keep the pages turning. Would-be pilot Sansa is an engaging protagonist: gutsy and determined, if more than a bit stubborn and quick to make snap judgments. The supporting cast is diverse and interesting.
Author Brandon Sanderson does a good job of choreographing the space battles, so that the reader knows what's happening and what the stakes are. But the book seems longer than it needs to be, and some of the revelations at the end feel rushed.

"Rad American Women A-Z: Rebels, Trailblazers, and Visionaries Who Shaped Our History ... and Our Future!","Artful profiles of groundbreakers are fresh, inspiring.","RAD AMERICAN WOMEN A-Z offers mini-biographies of 25 diverse U.S. women from the 18th through the 21st centuries who broke barriers, accomplished great things, and paved the way for girls and women who came after them. Each bio (usually five to six paragraphs long) is accompanied by a strong graphic portrait of the woman featured, except X, which stands for ""the women whose stories we haven't learned about yet, and the women whose stories we will never read."" In the mix, political activist and teacher Angela Davis and rock star Patti Smith shine alongside visionary dancer Isadora Duncan, labor activist Dolores Huerta, and sculptor Maya Lin, who designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C.
","Besides the dazzling visual presentation, what also makes Rad American Women A-Z special is the fresh selection of women profiled. It's not a fusty, dusty history book. There are women from a wide variety of fields, from sports and entertainment to politics, literature, science, law, medicine, and more -- and many of them are still living.
With striking art and lively, engaging storytelling, Rad American Women A-Z is both inspiring and accessible. Kids may be moved to positive action in their own communities by the list at the back titled ""26 Things That You Can Do to Be Rad."" A great choice for the home library or classroom.","Parents need to know that Kate Schatz's Rad American Women A-Z profiles game-changing, mold-breaking women from the 18th century to the present -- one for every letter of the alphabet (except X, which represents the untold stories of women from the past and those yet to come). The eclectic choices range from the well known, such as comedian Carol Burnett, tennis great Billie Jean King, and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, to the more obscure, such as Wilma Mankiller, first female chief of the Cherokee Nation, and transgender author/artist Kate Bornstein. The diverse capsule biographies are lively and succinct, the illustrations by Miriam Klein Stahl dynamic and graphically bold. It's an inspiring, accessible collection that adds to kids' understanding of American history.

Lucky Breaks,Newberry sequel quietly engages with story of friendship.,"Lucky is almost eleven and ready for life to change. Life in Hard Pan (population 43) is the same as ever. Lincoln, her best friend, is still tying knots, though now he plans to enter a contest which, if he wins, will take him to Europe for school. Lucky doesn't like the idea that she might be left alone in Hard Pan without Lincoln. Miles, their 6 year-old genius sidekick, tells Lucky and Lincoln a story about a brooch lost in Hard Pan's abandoned well years ago. But once Paloma comes to town, Lucky is smitten with the idea of a new best friend -- a girl -- someone with whom she can laugh and dream. In trying to impress Paloma, Lucky neglects and even hurts her old friends. But once Lucky gets herself into a frightening situation involving the abandoned well, she begins to see just how important and special her old friends truly are.
","This story, like the small town depicted, is not filled with splash or action, and it unfolds with quiet intrigue. The first half of the book is fairly slow, and some kids may have a hard time committing to finishing the book. But dedicated readers will enjoy the eclectic characters going about their daily life -- running a cafe, tying knots, living in an old water tank, receiving deliveries from trucks -- and eventually will be rewarded with action that proceeds swiftly. Once Lucky and Paloma go on their adventure the story moves more quickly and unfolds with satisfaction.
There are some good messages embedded in this story, such as paying attention to the things you care about, how it's worse to be hurtful than to get hurt, and that being afraid of responsibility can be harmful. As a character, Lucky feels both immature and too mature at the same time, as she makes selfish decisions but also seems to have an ability to self-reflect and apologize. Overall, this story is best for committed readers who don't mind a small-town pace, and for those who are willing to get to know an eclectic cast of likable characters.","Parents need to know that this book is tame. While Lucky's mother died several years ago and she has since been abandoned by her father to his ex-wife (Brigitte), Lucky is taken care of and loved by Brigitte and a full coterie of adults in town. One issue, however, is that throughout the story Lucky wonders why her father doesn't take care of her and why he gave her up, and this is never resolved. Parents also need to know that Charles Darwin is Lucky's hero. They should be aware that this book might be better for girls than boys, and that it starts slow before building to a story with any action.

The Madman of Piney Woods,"Moving 1901 adventure explores race, class, mental illness.","Benji and Red couldn't be more different. Benji is African-American, loves the woods, and wants to grow up to be a newspaper reporter. Red is Irish with bright red hair and approaches everything like the scientist he wants to be. The one thing they have in common is the fearful soul that wanders the woods between their two towns. When a chance meeting brings the boys together, their adventurous peek into the life of the mysterious man in the woods is both beautiful and tragic.
","Kids will love THE MADMAN OF PINEY WOODS for its mystery, adventure, and ordinary moments that become extraordinary. The opportunity to see both sides of the story is offered throughout the book, though the back and forth between the characters can be a bit confusing at times. The personal perspectives on race, class, mental illness, and the complexities of life give the novel weight and create a real connection for readers.
Parents will appreciate the care author Christopher Paul Curtis took to offer varying perspectives on the tough subjects highlighted in the novel. He did a fantastic job in creating a story for children that isn't dumbed down or over dramatized. It can be jarring and frank at some points, simple and fun at others -- just like life. Parents and kids might want to read the book together to take advantage of the wonderful discussion opportunities it presents.","Parents need to know that The Madman of Piney Woods by Newbery Medal-winning author Christopher Paul Curtis (Bud, Not Buddy) is a companion novel to Curtis' Newbery Honor book Elijah of Buxton, set 40 years later, in 1901, in the same Canadian town of Buxton, Ontario. (You don't have to read Elijah to understand this one, but it adds to the experience.) The Madman of Piney Woods discusses race, the Civil War, the Irish immigration to Canada following the potato famine, and mental illness. It also shows violent acts during war battles, the death of an adult, the death of an animal, and domestic violence. Although not gratuitous, the violence is mentioned in a matter-of-fact way, and the author pulls no punches in describing blood, pain, smells, and the like. Children who are particularly sensitive should exercise caution.

"Oh, the Places You'll Go!","Jaunty, upbeat journey encourages perseverance.","Our hero (a cheerful little guy in a yellow jumpsuit) receives the narrator's good wishes and heads out of town. He travels through a wide variety of colorful Seussian landscapes and cityscapes and finds himself in many different situations -- some exhilarating, some depressing, some downright frightening. At one point he gets stuck in the Waiting Place, where ""everyone is just waiting ... waiting, perhaps, for their Uncle Jake / or a pot to boil, or a Better Break / or a string of pearls, or a pair of pants / or a wig with curls, or Another Chance."" At another moment, he's riding high on an elephant's back with a triumphant banner flapping overhead. At another he's rowing a tiny rowboat through a black lagoon full of howling, long-necked Hakken-Kraks. The plucky protagonist faces each challenge and extricates himself from each Hang-up, Lurch, and Slump. His success is ""98 and 3/4 percent guaranteed""!
","This is the last book Seuss wrote, so it is easy to get sentimental about it; yet it's an inspiring, poignant work on its own terms. The illustrations are a little shaky-looking compared with earlier ones, and there are one or two flaws in the rhyme's meter, but otherwise it is as beautifully crafted as anything Dr. Seuss ever wrote. And the message is clear and moving: Life can be extremely tough at times, but we will be just fine if we keep on the road and tackle each challenge as it presents itself.
Though Dr. Seuss was still alive when this book was published, some critics sensed it was his last. It does seem like a retrospective of his career: Horton-like elephants parade the hero triumphantly along, carrying flapping banners or canopies. A psychedelic interior decorated with billowy, colorful stripes resembles a circus tent, bringing back memories of If I Ran the Circus.","Parents need to know that this is a jaunty, upbeat journey packed with wacky landscapes, buildings, monsters, and musical instruments. Even those who don't understand Dr. Seuss' message will be swept up and marched cheerfully along. This classic, which encourages perseverance and taking adversity in stride, has become a common gift for graduates, from grade school through college.

"The Queen of Nothing: The Folk of the Air, Book 3",Clever fantasy in Faerie ends with charm and enchantment.,"As THE QUEEN OF NOTHING opens, Jude has been exiled from Faerie and forced to remain in the mortal world, thanks to her husband, Cardan. When she's called upon to rescue her twin sister, Taryn, Jude is pulled back into the deadly court court politics she thought she'd escaped. She vows to get revenge on everyone who betrayed her, and it's  long list. Meanwhile, Cardan's curse comes to fruition, and war threatens to boil over in the various kingdoms of Elfhame.
","After three volumes filled with adventure, romance, and sly humor, this modern-day saga of magical intrigue concludes with surprises galore. Author Holly Black orhestrates a highly satisfying ending, tying up narrative threads with panache. The only quibble might be that Cardan spends too much time sequestered from Jude. Their spiky relationship is what gives the series its oomph. Nevertheless, readers who have experienced the whole series will likely be satisfied by The Queen of Nothing and ready for more from this prolific storyteller.","Parents need to know that The Queen of Nothing is the concluding volume in The Folk of the Air trilogy by Holly Black. Set mostly in Faerie, the plot emphasizes courtly intrigue, but it also includes a lot of physical action.

Let the Children March,Powerful art amplifies inspiring civil rights protest tale.,"LET THE CHILDREN MARCH tells the story of the 1963 Brimingham Children's Crusade, narrated by a ficitonal young girl who volunteers for it. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. organizes  peaceful march for May 2 to protest segregationist Jim Crow laws, and kids volunteer to march to avoid the risk of their parents losing their jobs if they did. ""By the end of the day, 973 young marchers were jailed."" The next day more protesters, mostly children, are arrested -- close to 1,000 people -- nd police use high-pressure water hoses to control the crowds. The third day they use water and and police dogs, and our narrator is thrown into a police wagon and sent to jail. Kids and adults continue to protest through March 9. ""The water hoses they used to sting us/ could not stop our fierce tide."" Thousands of young people are imprisoned. ""But we had been heard, and the seeds of revolution were sown!"" On May 10, ""Dr. King had reached an agreement with the white leaders of the city. Desegregation would begin."" The girl and her brother are reunited with their parents, and a month later are playing on a playground they'd never been allow to play on before. Two months later, the family eats at a diner they'd never been allowed to eat in before. ""Our march made a difference. We children led the way."" ","In simple, dramatic scenes and spare text, a young girl walks readers through the momentous events of the historic Birmingham Children's Crusade of 1963. Let the Children March shows kids overcoming fear and risking danger and imprisonment to stand up for what's right -- and to protect their parents, who feared losing their jobs if they protested. Through her young narrator, author Monica Clark-Robinson brings readers close to how it felt to be one of those marchers. And Frank Morrison's vivid oil paintings feature many close-ups that drive home the emotions of the child participants and the white townspeople and police who opposed them.
Back matter gives more historical information, with three rchival photographs of the marchers. And superb end papers highlight significant historical moments cleverly displayed on signs held by children -- from Alabama Gov. George Wallace's Jan. 14, 1963, declaration of ""segregation forever"" to the passage of the Voting Rights Act on Aug. 6, 1965, which ""ended practices that had barred African Americans from their right to vote.""","Parents need to know that Let the Children March, by Monica Clark-Robinson and illustrated by Frank Morrison, won a 2019 Coretta Scott King (Illustrator ) Honor. It's the story of the Children's Crusade, which began May 2, 1963, in Birmingham, Alabama, when kids and teens marched to protest discriminatory Jim Crow laws.

An Enchantment of Ravens,Magic and romance mix well in intricate faerie tale.,"At the start of AN ENCHANTMENT OF RAVENS, 17-year-old artist Isobel works the Craft, the practical knowledge -- cooking, painting, writing -- denied to the immortal fair folk. She is happy to take on Rook, the prince of autumn, as a new client. But the portrait scandalizes the fair folk, seeming to suggest that Rook possesses human emotions, an offense punishable by death. Furious, Rook spirits Isobel away to stand trial, but he is attacked by mysterious forces. If they are to survive, Isobel and Rook must work together, even as they grow closer to breaking one of the primary laws of the land: that humans and fair folk must never fall in love.
","Fast-paced, frequently funny, and unpredictable, this novel will enchant fantasy readers. While author Margaret Rogerson is attuned to the traditions of faerie lore, her scene-setting and characterizations in An Enchantment of Ravens feel fresh and compelling. Main character Isobel is a vivid heroine: competent, soulful, clever, and empathetic. And she's well matched by Rook, the crown prince of autumn, who comes to love and depend on her.
Stories about the ""fair folk"" offer ample opportunity for scenes of magic and intrigue, and this stand-alone fantasy plays those elements to the hilt.
 ","Parents need to know that An Enchantment of Ravens is a stand-alone fantasy, set among the ""fair folk"" (faeries) of British folklore. It features an unusually strong female protagonist, one not waiting for a prince to save her. Acts of violence tend to be magical in nature, although one character has a finger chopped off. Infrequent swearing includes ""hell,"" ""damn,"" and ""s--t."" The main characters fall in love and share passionate embraces, but they pull back before going too far.

The Zero Degree Zombie Zone,"Fast-paced adventure with friends, zombies, and magic.","Bakari Katari Johnson is in big trouble. Zombies are going to invade Earth unless he can find a missing magical ring, and his best bud tricked him into running for hall monitor against the most popular kid in school. He's not sure what's worse, getting beat to a pulp by his opponent's biggest fan or being eaten by zombies (and is there a difference?).
","THE ZERO DEGREE ZOMBIE ZONE is a fun, quick-paced read that keeps readers engaged and laughing. The story is both strange and familiar, with characters navigating the social minefields of school and then suddenly falling into a world where a horrific ice monster is threatening them and Earth with a frozen zombie invasion. Readers want to root for Bakari, and author Patrik Henry Bass does an excellent job of creating an entertaining story featuring believable characters with nuanced personalities.
Bass mostly breaks out of the stereotypical and popular kid-versus-morally-superior-misfits scenario that's common in kids' literature, though the overweight, bumbling, sidekick/best friend trope does make an unwelcome appearance. Overall, kids and parents will enjoy the action, message, and story.","Parents need to know that The Zero Degree Zombie Zone is the story of shy fourth-grader (and narrator) Bakari Katari Johnson, who's thrust into the role of hero as he tries to prevent a zombie invasion from an icy planet.

"The Dark Prophecy: The Trials of Apollo, Book 2",More action-focused sequel a win for Percy Jackson fans.,"In THE DARK PROPHECY, when Apollo, Leo, and Calypso land in Indianapolis atop their metal dragon Festus, they're greeted with an ambush. The streets are teaming with the minions of Emperor Commodus -- very strong creatures called blemmyae with faces in their chests. With the help of former Artemis hunters, they escape to the Waystation, a sentient building that houses an assortment of demigods, griffins, and the formerly immortal. Well, usually. When Apollo and friends enter, the many rooms are empty except for the ex-hunters Emmie and Jo. They explain that slowly Commodus had kidnapped everyone, including the griffins nd Emmie and Jo's 7-year-old adopted daughter. They must be saved, and soon, and the throne of Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory, must be recovered or their friends will be forced to fight in the arena and their daughter will go mad. The multistep quest sounds hard enough, but to make matters worse, both the bloodthirsty megalomaniac Commodus and the oracle Trophonius have very old scores to settle with Apollo.
","If you like fighting mythological creatures and impossible quests that lead to more impossible quests and more fighting mythological creatures, you will thoroughly dig this sequel. By the end of the book you'll need the help of Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory, just to recall when Apollo and friends fought the giant serpent, when they were set upon by pits of smaller venomous snakes or weird creatures with faces below their armpits, or by Germani soldiers, or by helmeted fighting ostriches. It's all big fun, but it does blur together after a while.
There's less focus on character development here than in the first book, The Hidden Oracle, mostly because Apollo has already accepted his fate as a tortured mortal. His endearing relationship with Meg, his polar opposite, continues to develop on the sidelines of all the action. And the dedication of the ex-hunter couple Emmie and Jo to their mortal life as parents in the Waystation adds nice depth to the story. Blink, and you'll miss it, though. The Dark Prophecy is back to the action quicker than one of Artemis' Hunters can draw her bow.","Parents need to know that The Dark Prophecy is the second book in a series that's a spin-off of a Percy Jackson spin-off series. Did you follow that? The Percy Jackson and the Olympians series came first, then the Heroes of Olympus. It helps to read them both before digging into the Trials of Apollo series. The storyline picks up after the war at the end of the Heroes of Olympus, and many old favorite characters make cameos or are mentioned (yay, Leo!). And, for extra credit, reading the Apollo chapter in Percy Jackson's Greek Gods helps when our ""suddenly mortal and very unhappy about it"" narrator Apollo recounts key moments of his godly life. Like in the first book, there's a lot to learn about mythology nd history, especially about the Roman Emperor Commodus' reign. The violence ratchets up a little from the last book thanks to arena fighting (with tortured animals -- blame Commodus), some beheadings (three simply because Commodus was bored), and lots of skirmishes with mythological creatures who cause injuries to mortals. For kids who dislike snakes, watch out for the giant serpent and the pit of poisonous vipers. For animal-loving kids, expect one sad animal death and a commitment by characters to take care of the mistreated animals.

From the odd proprietor, Mr. Peregrine, Darwen receives a small mirror and hangs it on his closet door. At night, the mirror becomes a portal to an enchanted world, and when monsters from the other side threaten to spill out into our reality, Darwen and his friends must act to prevent a full-scale invasion.

Although Darwen is from working-class Northern England and his adventures take place in Atlanta, GA, he and the new friends he's made at private Hillside Academy, fellow outsiders Alexandra and Rich, are a little too reminiscent of Harry, Hermione, and Ron.

Ghost Time,Daring and confusing story about love and time.,"Artistic, 15-year-old Thea is thrown into confusion when Cam, her math-genius boyfriend, disappears. From that moment, the story, narrated by Thea, alternates forward and backward in time. Cam's theory, that time is a code that can be hacked, appears to be coming true, as past events are shown to change and disjoin from the present. Thea's love for Cam grounds her sufficiently to hope for his return.
 ","With chapters alternating between past and present, some readers might like the reality-bending aspect of GHOST TIME;  others may find it confusing. The plot turns on whether artistic Thea will be reunited with her nerdy boyfriend, who disappears for reasons unknown.
The first in a trilogy, this installment leaves many mysteries unresolved and might lose some readers before the sequels appear. The story grows stronger as it reaches deeper into Thea's past, fraught with self-cutting, and the healing she achieves through the love of her first boyfriend.","Parents need to know that the convoluted plot of Ghost Time, a fantasy with a paranormal element, involves 15-year-old narrator-protagonist Thea being exposed to shame when she appears in sex videos that go viral on the Internet. She knows the incidents never actually happened (and they are not explicitly described), but the emotional charge of the story derives from episodes in which a feisty teen faces nightmares of confusion. Her rage and self-cutting after the breakup of her parents might make some young readers uneasy. Thea uses all the four-letter words when under stress, and some crude language, like ""ass,"" when she's not. There's teen drinking, some nudity, and Thea describes passionate sex with her boyfriend.

Thief of Dreams,Boy is horrified to discover uncle's secret life.,"Martin's type-A parents go on a month-long business trip to China over the Christmas holidays, leaving Martin in their new mansion with Elka, the maid, and his uncle Lawrence, whom he barely remembers. Happy holidays.
Uncle Lawrence turns out to be a pretty nice guy, who pays attention to Martin, is kind to Elka, and makes the household begin to feel like a family. But he has strange habits, goes out at odd hours, and seems to have secrets. When Martin's curiosity gets the better of him and he begins to snoop around, he finds a lot more than he bargained for.
","This interesting and mildly suspenseful story is told by Martin in the second person, an unusual technique that gives it voice and immediacy. Many kids this age and younger tend to speak and write this way, until their teachers correct them, so it lends a bit of authenticity as well, and makes one wonder why it isn't used more often in teen novels.
Veteran author Todd Strasser wisely doesn't trowel it on too thick: Uncle Lawrence is a nice guy, not the second coming, and Martin is vaguely lonely and sad, not miserable and abused. Mild is the operative word here -- the story is mildly suspenseful, Martin's voice is mildly sardonic, and the characters are all painted in pastel shades. Thus the strength of Martin's connection to Lawrence that is revealed near the end comes a bit out of left field. But the story flows smoothly and keeps the reader involved to the end.","Parents need to know that the boy's parents have little time for him, and his uncle proves to be a criminal.

"Sky Raiders: Five Kingdoms, Book 1","Fast-paced adventure, slow storytelling in series opener.","It was Cole's idea, a trip to a new neighbor's haunted house on Halloween. He'd invited his best friend Dalton and his sometimes crush Jenna, and a whole group of kids ended up going. It turned out to be way worse than a haunting -- it was a kidnapping. Cole managed to hide in the curtains as his friends were chained up and taken down a manhole. He followed behind just to report to police where they were headed. What a nasty surprise when he started to fall and kept on falling -- right into another realm with no known way back. Of course Cole felt responsible and tried hard to free his friends, but that only made things worse. He found himself not only enslaved like his friends, but hauled off by himself as the property of the Sky Raiders -- scavengers who raid castles floating in the sky toward a Cloud Wall from which nothing ever returns. How will he first find his way out of the Sky Raiders, then find and rescue his friends? His new mysterious and magical friend Mira may have a way to help ... if Cole doesn't die helping her first.
","Fans of Brandon Mull know he needs a warm-up period with each of his series, and SKY RAIDERS is an OK warm-up that rabid fans will enjoy. The sky castles are pretty darn cool. So are the magic renderings and fights with giant plastic dinosaurs on top of even bigger cheesecakes. But casual fans and readers who like a clear picture of where the story is headed at the regularly appointed time (ahem, first plot point a quarter of the way through, pretty please) will be drumming their fingers, even through some of the cooler action scenes, because the action isn't moving the story along. Another problem with spending most of the book making this new world cool and interesting: The main character, still a sixth grader, barely mentions parents or mourns the life he left behind. The omission seems almost as strange as, well, fighting plastic dinosaurs on top of a cheesecake.","Parents need to know that Sky Raiders is the first book in the Five Kingdoms series from fantasy author Brandon Mull, who developed a big fan base from his Fablehaven and Beyonders series. If kids have lready read some of Mull's books, they'll find the start of this series less violent and just a little less complex than Beyonders. There's one moment of gore that's more ""eww"" than anything: The main character's sword punctures a cyclops' eye at fast speed and goes through it ""as if he had punched a deep bowl of warm pudding."" While child slaves get hit and deaths happen -- most from a catapult's flaming arrows taking down ships in the sky -- there's a respect for life in many skirmishes. Main character Cole aims an arrow at his attacker's leg, and a giant creature out destroying towns takes people captive instead of killing them. Cole's a very brave sixth grader, willing to risk his life repeatedly on a quest to save his friends.

Dogs,All kids wanted to know about man's best friend.,"If your children aren't already crazy about dogs, they will be after this survey of all they ever wanted to know about man's best friend. The appealing format features illustrations and photos of hundreds of dogs, and many facts about them in easily digestible chunks of text.
 ","This book is an excellent resource for children and adults -- highly recommended for purchase before you get a dog. It is entertaining and informative, even for families that already have a canine pet. In a friendly, informal format, it emphasizes that many factors are important in selecting a dog -- male or female, mongrel or purebred, adult dog or puppy -- as is whether to obtain your new pet from a store, a pound or shelter, or a private party.
The author emphasizes selecting a breed compatible with your lifestyle, and covers important points about feeding, caring for, and playing with a dog, and how to recognize its needs and its attempts to communicate with you. Inquisitive kids will also get a kick out of reading about the origins of Canis familiaris, studying the anatomical features and differences among breeds, and reading about the fascinating ways in which dogs have been used: hunting, herding, rescue, assistance for the disabled, and even as living weapons of war.","Parents need to know that kids are interested in reading about everything from the first domesticated dogs to how to train pets, and the art and photography, though of uneven quality, are appealing.

Not the Girls You're Looking For,Half-Iraqi teen finds her way in scattered coming-of-ager.,"In NOT THE GIRLS YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, Lulu Saad is a half-Iraqi teen living in Houston, Texas, inseparable from her three best friends. It's senior year and everything's going great -- except for that horrible Dane Anderson in her French class. Into her life walks charming James, and Lulu is inexplicably intrigued by him -- so much so that she pushes him into a pool. From then on, things tumble out of control -- from outbursts at Ramadan to fights with her friends and numerous drunk party mistakes. Amid the mess, Lulu must figure out who exactly she is, what's important to her, and who's worth fighting for. And while she repairs relationships with loved ones, Lulu's cooking up a revenge plot to make sure that no one ... nd she means no one ... messes with her and the people she loves.
","Through the flawed, vulnerable character of Lulu, this coming-of-age story offers n authentic perspective on what it's like to feel caught between two cultures nd not fully a part of either one. Lulu's experience as a biracial Muslim can be relatable for teens who've ever felt isolated because of their ethnicity, and having her as the narrator gives readers an honest glimpse of the discrimination that Muslim Americans face. Teens may find themselves relating to parts of Lulu, but the plot is all over the place, with no clear direction at times, and some of the characters are underdeveloped.
Lulu is  confusing character, and there are a lot of things that may disappoint readers about her and her trash-talking girlfriends. While her group of friends is very close and they stand up for one another, they also put one another down quite a lot, for no apparent reason. James and Lulu's romance is very cute and playful, and teens will root for them to end up together.","Parents need to know that Not the Girls You're Looking For is an edgy book for older teens that deals with friendship, family, ethnic prejudice, and romance. It centers on Lulu, a biracial Arab American Muslim teen (her mom is a white American Catholic, her dad an Iraqi Muslim) during the month of Ramadan. Almost all the teen characters drink heavily at parties, and there's kissing and vivid descriptions of sexual encounters. Lulu has sex and prepares for it by going to the doctor to get birth control. There's  confusing portrayal of consent (the encounter begins as consensual but then turns) nd blurred lines about what's OK nd what is not. And there's strong language throughout, including ""s--t"" and ""f--k."" The book has a positive message about staying true to yourself no matter what people say and being loyal to people who love you for you. Teens may want to discuss the discrimination Lulu faces as a half-Iraqi girl nd what love and relationships should look like.

Black Rabbit Summer,British murder mystery is full of adult content.,"Pete, Nicole, Eric, Pauly, and Raymond used to hang out together as kids. Now that they've graduated from high school and are headed separate ways, Nicole proposes a final party, followed by a night at the fair. Pete tries to watch out for his best friend, Raymond, who everyone else calls ""Mental Ray"" because Raymond believes his rabbit speaks to him. Somehow, Pete loses track of Raymond, who never turns up after the fair. Neither does a homegrown celebrity, Stella Ross. Now Raymond and all the gang are suspects in what turns out to be a murder case. A local hood, Wes, threatens Pete when he tries to do his own investigation. Pete knows he's getting closer to the truth -- if he doesn't get killed first.
","It's hard for readers to invest in this murder mystery since Pete, the depressed first-person narrator, doesn't. Pete is ""happy enough doing nothing"" and plans to study law in college because he can't think of other options. Even after his friends kill a girl and beat him up, he's pretty blasé about it.
Brooks' prose is surprisingly trite and badly in need of editing. Many passages in this nearly 500-page book are annoyingly repetitive -- to say nothing of the excessive use of one-sentence paragraphs (It was hot. [Break] I was sweating. [Break] My throat hurt.) Character motivation is vague at best. The whole talking rabbit thing seems tossed in for a little atmosphere. The plot hinges on a fake kidnapping attempt, but the only explanations as to why the celebrity bothers with all this trouble are also pretty vague. Raymond's situation is unresolved at the ending, which suggests either a sequel or laziness. ""He's just gone."" But nobody really cares.","Parents need to know that this book involves a murder of a teen by a teen, suicide, hallucinogenic drug use, and drunken teen sex. After all that, other iffy behavior seems rather tame: teens lie to their parents and police, smoke cigarettes and pot, and drink hard alcohol recreationally. Another disturbing element is the main character's apathy toward his own life and others'. When Pete learns his friend killed a girl, he notes, ""I just didn't care. I know that probably sounds pretty callous, but the simple truth is -- I didn't like [her].""

"Middle School: How I Survived Bullies, Broccoli, and Snake Hill","Rafe goes to camp, faces bullying, copes with gross humor.","Rafe arrives at Camp Wannamorra and discovers it's a summer school/summer camp with lessons every morning! He also finds out he's in the ""loser cabin,"" The Muskrats. The Bobcats, the ""cool cabin,"" have labeled him and the other Muskrats ""Dead Meat"" and take every opportunity to bully them with words or mean pranks. Led by their leader, Doolin, the Bobcats are the worst kind of bullies. Their sole mission at camp is to make life miserable for the Muskrats. Adult characters for the most part are not helpful and portrayed as stupid. Major Sherwood, the camp director, considers the bullying harmless razzing and all part of camp fun. Rafe unites his bunkmates and gains some short-lived relief from the Bobcats. Although Rafe ends up being kicked out of camp (no spoiler here, Rafe tells us himself in the first few pages), he does so to help his friend Norman.
 ","This fourth book, which sees Rafe continuing his daily battles with bullies, is the least interesting of Patterson's Middle School series, with a less cohesive plot and characters. That said, there are some interesting twists. The scary bunkmate Legend turns out to have a kind heart and helps protect the other Muskrats from the bullying Bobcats. Norman, whom Doolin had given the camp nickname ""Booger Eater"" years ago, reveals to Rafe a bit about his unhappy home life and abusive father. For Norman, coming to Camp Wannamorra is a picnic compared with a summer at home.
Norman's love of reading is his key to survival, and he's able to turn Rafe on to the joy of books. Ultimately, even with its weaknesses, the book's middle school humor and engaging illustrations will appeal to many readers.
 ","Parents need to know that Middle School: How I Survived Bullies, Broccoli, and Snake Hill, is the fourth book in the series following Middle School: The First Years of My Life, Middle School: Get Me Out of Here!, and Middle School: My Brother Is a Big, Fat Liar. Although there's an underlying anti-bullying message, there's also a lot of gross humor, and protagonist Rafe isn't as interesting a character as in the first two books. He does help his bunkmates, but the book is missing the interesting underlying conflicts that drive him. Still, tweens will find this a good quick read with lots of great illustrations.

The Schwa Was Here,Going unnoticed isn't always fun.,"Calvin Schwa is one of those kids who doesn't get noticed, even when he's standing in the middle of the boy's bathroom singing ""God Bless America"" while wearing an orange sombrero and a cat costume. When Antsy Bonano does finally notice him, the decide to test the ""Schwa Effect,"" then to make some money from it. They go one dare too far, however, and end up doing penance to a crabby, rich old man with a beautiful blind granddaughter.
Fun aside, though, not being noticed can be tough, especially for the Schwa, whose mother disappeared when he was five and whose father seems to be out in space most of the time. As Antsy learns more about the Schwa's miserable life, he's determined to be the one who notices. But the Schwa has something more dramatic in mind.
","Neal Shusterman has a unique imagination, which can make his books hard to describe. This one skirts the edge of fantasy, sometimes perhaps sticking a toe over the line. The form is a sort-of legend, reminiscent of Maniac Magee, but the voice is a not-totally-consistent but often wicked Brooklyn smart-alec. The combination is fluidly readable, unpredictable, and poignantly funny.
The chapter titles give a pretty good idea of the mood of the book: ""Manny Bullpucky Gets his Sorry Butt Hurled off the Marine Park Bridge,"" ""Which is Worse: Getting Mauled by a Pack of Dogs or Getting Your Brains Bashed out by a Steel Poker?"" and so on. But there's also a lot to think about and talk about here, most notably the whole Schwa Effect -- it may be a comic exaggeration, but it's all too real for many tweens.","Parents need to know that this is a borderline-fantasy take on a real problem: Young adolescents who feel invisible, unnoticed.

The Lifters,"Quirky fable promotes family, community, teamwork.","When the struggling Flowerpetal family moves to the decaying town of Carousel in search of a better life, it sets 12-year-old son Granite (hoping to be known as Gran at his new school) on the path to a fateful meeting with THE LIFTERS, a secret society formed to help keep Carousel's streets and buildings from collapsing. Things have been steadily falling apart since the town's carousel company, once world-famous, shut down. Morale is low, the citizens squabble, and buildings suddenly fall down for no reason. Middle school is pretty grim also. But Gran begins to suspect that the strange, fierce girl in his class, the only one to befriend him (when she's not punching him in the stomach), knows more than most about what's going on -- and may be doing something about it. Also, magic seems to crop up in unexpected places.
","Author Dave Eggers delivers a fun read packed with positive messages, mysterious magic, and a couple of determined 12-year-olds pitted against dark forces. En route to the cosmic battle between the town-devouring Hollows and the Lifters trying to stop them, the plot touches on real-life issues including disability, depression, unemployment -- and mortifying scenes at school.","Parents need to know that The Lifters, by Dave Eggers, is a quirky fable about magic, family, friendship, and community, set in a small town that's been slowly (and literally) collapsing ever since the local, once legendary carousel company shut down. It's warm, it's funny, it's positive -- and it's also packed with assorted troubles and human frailty that will be very relatable to some readers and too much for others. These include 12-year-old Gran's own problems (starting with being named Granite Flowerpetal), especially when he has to spend a day in pee-soaked pants because a teacher won't let him go to the restroom; his little sister's habit of barfing every time she gets excited; his artist mother's depression since the incident that left her in a wheelchair; and his father's difficulty finding work.

Slide,Fast-paced story of teen who can see from a killer's eyes.,"High school student Sylvia (Vee) Bell is dealing with a lot of issues. Since her mom's death from cancer, Vee has been a surrogate parent to her younger teen sister, Mattie, because her surgeon father is always either saving lives in the operating room or helping survivors in support groups online. Vee has also been diagnosed with narcolepsy, but instead of sleeping during the episodes, she \""slides\"" into other people's minds. During one such episode, she's appalled to see the body of her sister's best friend through the eyes of the girl's unknown killer. But, since the only time she confided her mysterious ability to anyone, her father packed her off to a psychiatrist, Vee is in a quandary about what to do when the girl's death is called a suicide, and more death on the cheerleading squad follows. Also, there's a hot new guy in school who's taking an interest in Vee, much to the annoyance of the popular girls -- and Vee's best friend, Rollins.
","The fast-moving plot keeps the reader intrigued. Author Jill Hathaway, a high school teacher, really captures the toxic environment of back-stabbing mean girls, philandering teachers, sadistic administrators, and jock sexual predators, all through the eyes of a smart, odd, pink-haired teen who's doing her best to keep herself and her family safe. Vee is a strong and appealing character, and if the supporting characters are sometimes a bit cartoonish, they're also recognizable as people you've probably met in real life.","Parents need to know that both teens and adults behave questionably in Slide. Kids drink alcohol, often to excess; some boys are quite predatory in their relationships with girls, and Vee narrowly escapes being date-raped during one of her narcoleptic episodes; mean-girl behavior abounds; extramarital affairs by adults leave wreckage in the next generation; there's murder, attempted murder, and suicide. Sixteen-year-old Vee has been the designated adult in her family since she was 11, when her mother died and her father became physically and emotionally absent. She has better judgment than many adults to keep herself and her sister safe, but that doesn't always keep trouble away.

It's Hard to Be Five,"Growing up is a challenge ... but fun, too!","A squirmy 5-year-old struggles as he learns ""how to work [his] control panel"" and do the things a 5-year-old is supposed to do. His mind tells him how he should act and what he should do, but he finds himself doing just the opposite. His world is changing, and he feels frustrated. But he also begins to realize that as he gains greater control, he becomes more independent -- and independence can be fun!
","IT'S HARD TO BE FIVE is a remarkable book with outstanding illustrations and a true-to-life message. The tug and pull of the 5-year-old's struggle with his ""control buttons"" is clearly echoed in the rhyming language, which kids will surely enjoy. Though at times the rhymes are a bit stilted, the playful print and rhythm of the words on the page add to the fun. Vibrant, colorful, intricate illustrations complete the message in a way that seems kid-like and entertaining.
Though It's Hard to Be Five is playful and silly, the message is an important one: Growing up can be tough, and it can be frustrating. Kids will learn that ""some fun things are hard.

The Goodness Gene,A poor take on evil future government.,"Will is the son of the Compassionate Director of the Dominion of the Americas in a post-apocalyptic future. He and his brother, Berk, have been raised in privilege and trained for leadership, someday to take over from their father. They eat artificial food, breathe artificial air, and live in a loveless, sexless, sterile world where fetuses are created in labs and \""The Goodness\"" is enforced on all.
As part of his training Will is sent to observe some of the outlying areas, including a \""Compassionate Removal,\"" in which imperfect people are taken away, supposedly for a better life on an asteroid. But a ruptured appendix lands him in a hospital, where he begins to find out things about himself that turn his world upside down and make him realize that everything he has been taught a lie.
","When an author has a Point to make, the story usually takes a back seat -- and that is certainly true here. Author Sonia Levitin has a Point, as she details in an Author's Note and extensive source list, though even with all that it's a little hard to see clearly just what it is, beyond ""we're all going to Hell in a hand basket."" And she hammers home that vague Point with a cudgel so heavy that it is at times almost laughable. She is so determined to stack the deck against this future society that she brings Hitler, that old reliable bogeyman, into the equation.
This kind of thing has been done before, and much better. Levitin starts right out by violating Rule 1 of dystopian novels: The society has to have at least some superficial appeal before the big reveal of the rot at its core, else why would anyone put up with it? It would be nice to have characters you can care about, and a story that doesn't just go on with nothing much happening other than the main character gradually realizing the painfully obvious.","Parents need to know that the comparative virtues of simulated sex and natural sex are discussed.

A brief stint as a seventh-grade secret agent spiced things up, but even coming up with an interesting prank is hard to do after you've saved the world. Be careful what you wish for: Carson learns one of his mentors at the super secret Agency is in mortal danger. He wants to help, but to save Agent Nineteen (and the world, again), he must betray his friends' trust and face extraordinary peril -- not the least of which involves scaling Mount Rushmore and breaking into a top-secret government facility.
","COUNTDOWN ZERO picks up a few months after Carson (aka Agent Zero) returns to civilian life but jumps right into the action with a very funny ""Prankpocalypse"" mission. Author Chris Rylander uses classic spy-genre tricks (patient traitors, convoluted revenge plots, bizarre scenarios) with a strong bent toward silly -- Carson finds himself scaling Mount Rushmore, falling into a snake pit, and sneaking through a bear preserve. Beneath the goofiness, there's a real sense of danger. Carson is neither a smooth James Bond nor a blundering Maxwell Smart: He's smart, but his greatest strengths are resolve and resourcefulness. He's burdened by grown-up concerns nd heartsick about lying to friends and seeing those he cares for in dangerous situations.
Some drawn-out action sequences drag a bit and may test readers' patience, but short chapters make it easily digestible for those challenged by long books.  ","Parents need to know that Countdown Zero, by Chris Rylander (The Fourth Stall), is less violent than Codename Zero, which kicked off the Countdown Conspiracy series, but it's still thrillingly packed with danger.

The hero's strong moral compass ensures this is more than an action-packed thrill ride.

Survivors Club: The True Story of a Very Young Prisoner of Auschwitz,Unforgettable true story of boy sent to death camp at age 4.,"Michael Bornstein never intended to tell the story of the SURVIVORS CLUB. It was only after seeing a photo of children (including Michael) liberated from Auschwitz posted on a Holocaust denial site that he knew he must speak out. The book begins in 1939 as Nazi soldiers take over Zarki, the small rural town in Poland where Michael lives with his parents, brother, and grandmother. Michael's father becomes head of Zarki's Jewish Council, and the bribes he gives to the head of the local Gestapo allow hundreds of townspeople people to escape and others to be saved from execution. But in 1942, all the town's Jews are ordered deported to labor and concentration camps. Michael's father and brother die at Auschwitz, but his mother eventually manages to smuggle him from the children's barracks into the women's barracks, where he hides until the camp is liberated. After the war, the surviving members of the extended Bornstein family are reunited. But because the life they knew in Poland is now gone, Michael and his mother become displaced persons, refugees waiting for visas to come to the United States.
","As so few children survived the Nazi death camps, Bornstein's haunting and heartbreaking memoir offers a unique perspective on the years before and after the Holocaust. Bornstein and his daughter and coauthor, Debbie Bornstein Holinstat, used research from the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial Museum in Israel, audio recordings and videotaped testimony, interviews with relatives, and a diary written by a survivor and family friend to weave together this remarkable story.
The preface notes that ""conversations were imagined, thoughts and feelings projected, certain names changed and some minor details adjusted ... ."" That said, the characters and their conversations, thoughts, and feelings never read as fiction but always have the ring of truth. A section of photos at the end of the book allows readers to put faces on Bornstein's parents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. One of the photos was taken just after the liberation of Auschwitz and shows Michael being held in his grandmother's arms. ","Parents need to know that Survivors Club: The True Story of a Very Young Prisoner of Auschwitz is written by Michael Bornstein, who was liberated from the Nazi concentration camp when he was only 4 years old. While most children lived for no more than two weeks after their arrival at Auschwitz, the extraordinary courage and ingenuity of his mother and grandmother kept him safe. The story told in Survivors Club moves from the Nazi occupation of Bornstein's small hometown in Poland to Auschwitz nd finally to the years after the end of the war when members of his extended family became ""displaced persons."" While the violence can be shocking (children are beaten and executed) and the prospect of death is ever-present, this memoir from one of the few Holocaust survivors still living is above all a book about the bonds of family and the power of hope.

This installment ends with the Coders ready to journey into Flatland.
","Graphic novels are an excellent way to tackle educational subjects, and this high-energy comic provides plenty of action in addition to coding lessons. Writer Gene Luen Yang and illustrator Mike Holmes balance the puzzles and the sci-fi adventure in Potions & Parameters, creating the perfect mix of instruction and comedy. The Coders meet new allies, but they also learn new things about themselves and the feelings they're developing for each other. Readers who've come this far will be eager for the next installment.","Parents need to know that this is the fifth volume in the Secret Coders fantasy graphic novel series by Gene Yang (Boxers & Saints, American Born Chinese) that teaches coding skills to elementary and middle schoolers, and it doesn't stand on its own. In this installment, the main character, 12-year-old Hopper, and her fellow coders, Josh and Eni, continue to learn programming and fight their covert war against Professor One-Zero and his mind-numbing Green Pop. The Secret Coders are menaced by ducks with teeth, but they defeat them with their coding skills. This is a fine choice for families looking for books with diverse characters, as Hopper's mother is Asian American nd Hopper's new best friend, Eni, is African American.

September Girls,Lyrical coming-of-age tale undercut by iffy gender messages.,"Sam's father suddenly decides to take him and his brother Jeff to the beach for the summer. In the preceding year, Sam's mother just leaves the family without giving a reason, so Sam is glad to get away for a while. He immediately notices something strange about the young women in all the service jobs in town, who seem inexplicably attracted to him instead of his older, more outgoing, and confident brother. Eventually Sam and Jeff get to know two of the Girls, as they're referred to, and Sam finds himself falling for one, DeeDee. Where she came from, where she's going, and what she needs to become a free and fully realized person provide the framework for Sam's journey into manhood.
","SEPTEMBER GIRLS is beautifully written. Author Bennett Madison is a formidable talent. But the merits of his lyrical language as it matches the rhythm of the sea are dishearteningly undercut by a fairly sexist attitude toward women, bringing to mind Vladimir Nabokov's Lolita. Older teens should be able to evaluate these issues and come to their own conclusions, but less sexually mature teens might need help with the advanced themes.
Sam's early, immature, sexist attitudes are unfortunately accepted and presented as the norm. This coupled with frequent, pervasive descriptions of women as sexual objects, sirens, and analogous to a school of fish undercut Sam's sexual and intellectual transformation into a thoughtful, caring adult. The climax is somewhat glossed over, diminishing its impact; maybe that's why some of the negatives are what stay with you instead of the positives.
 ","Parents need to know that September Girls takes us inside the mind of a 17-year-old boy anxious to lose his virginity. Issues surrounding sexuality are pervasive and very frank, and there's a fantasy element. There's frequent teen drinking and smoking. Marijuana comes up three or four times in a matter-of-fact way. Strong swear words like ""f--k"" and ""s--t"" are used too often to count, and slangy and sometimes derogatory terms are often used for body parts. There aren't a lot of great role models here, but Sam is a thoughtful young man whose attitudes mature over the course of a summer at the beach. Young women are depicted as sexual objects in competition with each other, who use their looks and sexuality as tools to get what they want. This message is somewhat tempered after we get to know a couple of individual Girls, as they're called, but the pervasive analogy of the Girls to a school of fish lingers even after Sam has his epiphany.

"Gathering Blue: The Giver, Book 2",Captivating quest tale pits gifted girl against brutal odds.,"Kira, born with a bad leg in a harsh society that shuns imperfections, is left an orphan when her mother suddenly dies of a mysterious illness. To her surprise, she's taken in by the Council of Guardians, given a comfortable room with food and indoor plumbing, and allowed to pursue the craft for which she has an unusual talent: embroidery. She trains with an old woman in how to make dyes and is given the task of restoring the robe worn by the Singer once a year, when he sings the history of the world to the people of the village. Unfortunately, as she learns along the way, she's only one of the artists whose talents are valued and perhaps exploited. Their elevated status, it seems, comes with a price: They may be pampered and admired, but they're not free.
Also, their unusually kind treatment hides many mysteries. What really happened to her parents? Why have they been taken in? Who is crying on the floor below? What is the nature of her talent that so interests the Council? With Thomas, a boy with a similarly unusual talent for carving, also orphaned and taken in by the Council, and Matt, a cheerful little urchin from the Fens, she begins to explore the nature of the society she has taken for granted. 
","The parallels with Lois Lowry's Newbery-winning novel The Giver re many. Both take place in ordered villages in a future after worldwide destruction, and both revolve around children who, given the task of preserving cultural memories, discover the secrets upon which their society is built. Although the first book explored a seemingly perfect high-tech future society, here the society is more medieval, both squalid and savage. As with The Giver, Gathering Blue asks readers to think about what sacrifices they would be willing to make to improve the world around them. In both stories, young people have special talents that not only save them but also burden them with responsibility and challenge them to find a way to make things better. That should make any one of us think.
The story is captivatingly simple yet complex, as are the characters. Some readers may wish for more explanation of a few mysterious events, as well as wish for an ending that seems more final. However, most fans of the earlier book will find this a well-written complement and will catch glimpses of a bigger picture yet to come. They will be yearning to read the next two books in the quartet. ","Parents need to know that Gathering Blue is the second book in Lois Lowry's The Giver quartet. While this book could stand alone, as can the others, it makes more sense and is more powerful when read with the other three, in order. Read second, Kira's story adds another dimension to Jonah's dystopian experience and promises more development and adventure. Both take place in the future after some kind of cataclysmic, world-shattering event and seem to fit together somehow, though exactly how is not clear. Kira's world is more savage and disorderly, with the kind of violent brutality that readers might expect in a story set in medieval times: Deformed people are outcasts, parents slap their children, day-to-day life is meager, dirty, and angry, and villagers are fearful and superstitious. However, as in The Giver, a young person with special qualities emerges as the hero, and the overriding message is that kindness, honesty, and a selfless use of talent will create a better future for all.

"Flying, Book 1",Cheerleader battles aliens in breezy action comedy.,"At the start of FLYING, 17-year-old cheerleader Mana is used to being coddled by her friends and family, but everything changes for her on the night when the guy she's attracted to flips out and starts spitting neon-green acid. Worse, Mana returns home to find the place trashed and her mother missing. A mysterious government agent claims to be her frumpy mom's partner in alien hunting and tells Mana that he's searching for a piece of technology that might either save the world or destroy it. To navigate the trail of secrets surrounding her family, Mana must rely on her own developing instincts, her new ability to jump to incredible heights, and the support of her best friend, Lyle, a boy for whom she's beginning to have romantic feelings.
","Author Carrie Jones finds an accessibly breezy tone for her narration and concocts a sci-fi adventure that offers plenty of fun, even if its plot is not particularly groundbreaking. Mixing comedy and action is a delicate balance, and this combination of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Men in Black expertly straddles genres. Main character Mana develops her sense of self-reliance as she searches for her kidnapped mother, and her transition from coddled cheerleader to tough alien-hunter is fun to witness.
The romantic subplot is handled with aplomb, even if the clever banter seems  little forced at times. All in all, the series is off to a flying start.","Parents need to know that Flying is the start of a new science fiction series by Carrie Jones, author of Need, about a small-town cheerleader whose mother is revealed to be an alien hunter. It combines action, comedy, and romance nd is narrated in a breezy, accessible tone. There's plenty of action, but it's not particularly violent. (There's gunplay, and a villain falls from a roof.) There's a small amount of swearing (""d--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""hell,"" and ""damn""), and the sexual content is limited to flirting and a couple of passionate embraces.

Daughter of the Pirate King,"Swashbuckling, snarky pirate-girl romp has gore galore.","Seventeen-year-old Princess Alosa, DAUGHTER OF THE PIRATE KING and a Siren, has just fallen into the clutches of her father's rivals, the young pirate captain Draxen and his 18-year-old brother Riden. But it's all part of an elaborate plan to please her brutal father (and probably avoid torture and imprisonment) by recovering a map he's convinced is stashed somewhere on Draxen's ship. Threats, imprisonment, beatings, hypnotic magic, deception, and intrigue ensue as the body count rises. Meanwhile, Alosa and Riden grapple with each other's deceit, rising romantic tension, and inexplicable twinges of conscience.
","Princess Alosa tells a fine tale, has many adventures, and takes care of herself, but the sheer overwhelming carnage as the story unfolds goes way beyond piratical genre-driven window-dressing. First-time author Tricia Levenseller delivers a spirited, snarky heroine who's quite at home in a murderously dysfunctional environment:
""'Kill the rest,' I say.
""Sorinda is the first to take out her sword. She starts stepping behind the men and slitting throats one after the other. Killing is practically an art for her. The way she moves is magical.""","Parents need to know that despite heavy marketing of its title character (a snarky, tricky, self-possessed 17-year-old) s ""a lady Jack Sparrow,"" Daughter of the Pirate King features a stunning quantity and casual acceptance of brutal violence as all in a day's work. That violence includes stabbings, throat-cuttings, beatings, torture, rape, and more. Princess Alosa and her 18-year-old captor/love interest have the occasional ethical twinge, setting them apart from most of the other characters. The story is fast-paced and a fun read, but its moral compass points to pretty dark territory.

I Am Love,Charming book in popular series has a big heart.,"In I AM LOVE, a love-filled main character with blue, purple, and pink hair sees a friend ""going through a storm."" They take a mindful moment with their hand on their heart and eyes closed before offering the friend an umbrella for the rain. The clouds part and the friends sit down to talk. A hug and the present of a flower help the friend feel not so glum. Illustrated and text-supported examples follow this opening that show love as self-care, a mistake being forgiven and fixed, remembering, and connection with other people (and even a cute dog) in tiny gestures of goodwill. End pages include an author's note, heart-opening yoga poses, and a heart meditation.
","This sweet, heartfelt book may be heavy on yoga teacher platitudes (the author does teach yoga), but the positive messages are hard to find fault with and Peter H. Reynold's art is lovely as always. The ""Love is…"" refrain of the text adds a nice rhythm to this as a read aloud. I Am Love doesn't shy away from the reality that kids will face hard situations (""storms""), which makes room for young readers who've already faced such challenges. Many parents will appreciate the diverse group of relatable kid characters. Featuring a main character who isn't clearly a girl or a boy means that kids of all genders can see themselves on the page.
Though all the friends come together at the end, there isn't a unifying story being told here and some pages feel shoehorned in, like the gratitude and self-care spread and a page about remembering loved ones lost. Aside from that, kids are likely to enjoy this book for its relatable characters and bright, engaging art, while parents will love its gentle lessons on love.","Parents need to know that I Am Love is part of the best-selling I Am… series from author Susan Verde and illustrator Peter H. Reynolds. The thoughtful main character is a self-aware messenger of love. When a friend is in a dark place, they ask, ""What can I do to help let the light back in?"" and model good listening, self-care, and forgiveness, among other acts of the heart. Featuring a diverse cast with a variety of genders, skin colors, and even pink, blue, and purple hair, kids will see something of themselves reflected in these pages.

The Tenth Girl,"Dense, eerie, violent horror story with surprising twist.","Mavi is intrigued and concerned about THE TENTH GIRL as soon as she starts her job teaching English at a remote, exclusive boarding school on the frigid southern tip of Argentina. When Mavi asks why only nine girls are present when she was told there would be 10, her boss assures her that the 10th girl will be joining them soon. But weeks and then months go by, and still no 10th girl. But strange and dangerous events quickly start unfolding:  Strange noises, shadowy figures, mysterious illnesses, and more make it clear to Mavi that more is going on than meets the eye t the school, long since cursed by the area's indigenous people. To say nothing of the often-repeated warning never to wander the house at night. The more Mavi tries to learn the truth, the more the house and its inhabitants seem to succumb to the ancient curse. If she ever hopes to escape, she'll have to learn the ultimate truth, but when she does it will completely shatter everything she knows about herself and the world she inhabits.
","This creepy, gothic spook-fest is best for mature fans of the genre. At first, author Sara Faring's debut novel seems a worthy successor to some of the great gothic horror novels of all time. But a weak, too-long middle and a twist that will jar some readers right out of everything she built over 400 pages of The Tenth Girl make it something else entirely. It's hard to define or put in a box what exactly that something else is, and speculating about it here would only spoil it. Be prepared to think about the nature of reality, existence, human relationships, and more from a completely unexpected, new angle.
Faring excels at creating mystery and eerie atmosphere around every corner, using everything from the weather to the architecture, and of course every character at her disposal. The middle does drag on for too long without advancing the story or heightening emotions. But keep going and the ending will blow your mind. You'll either love it or hate it. But it will definitely give you a lot to think about, whichever side you land on.","Parents need to know that The Tenth Girl is a horror-mystery with some real-world and fantasy violence that mentions blood, illness, and injuries, but most of the violence comes from the dark, eerie, and sometimes grotesque unknown. Themes include children losing parents; parents losing children; government-sanctioned violence like kidnapping, torture, and rape; implied sadistic behavior; implied sexual assault; bulllying; and physical and verbal abuse. Fantasy violence includes grotesque monsters that suck the life force out of people and horrific hauntings. There's a blossoming romance with one kiss. Lots of strong language, including ""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""d--k,"" and ""bitch."" Philosophical themes include the nature of reality, how important it is to be certain, how you can know who you really are and what you're meant to be, and the very nature of memory, human relationships, and existence. Best for mature readers who like to chew on large bites of food for thought, and who enjoy horror, of course.

Boy: Tales of Childhood,Dahl autobiography focuses on nasty school days.,"Roald Dahl's anecdotal autobiography focuses mostly on his unpleasant experiences at three schools. Between ages 7 nd 9, Dahl attended school in his Welsh hometown, where he and his friends declared war on the neighborhood sweetshop witch and were roundly caned by the schoolmaster. Attempting to save her son from such beatings, his mother sent him across the Channel to boarding school, where conditions were even worse and the boys had only each other in a world of authoritarian and often violent schoolmasters. At 13, he was graduated to Repton, where his athletic abilities and his size shielded him slightly from the general atmosphere of persecution, though he makes it clear that the headmaster was a genuine sadist. In this last section, Dahl also looks forward in time to his coming adventures in Africa, and allows himself some observations about how his childhood experiences shaped his later life.
","Because Dahl tells repeatedly of the cruelty of schoolmasters who constantly refined their caning techniques on him, some children will be saddened, and others enraged, by the unfairness of it all. These scenes clearly show the child's vulnerability in an adult world. But, unlike in most novels -- such as Dahl's own -- in this true story, the abusers never get their comeuppance. These are not reasons for children to avoid BOY, however; they may, in fact, be reasons children will respond to the book, which promotes the values of honest courage and determination. It also has lighter descriptions of teachers, such as the eccentric old bachelor, Corkers.","Parents need to know that this well-written book is most entertaining when author Roald Dahl sustains one adventure (like the mouse-and-sweetshop caper). But while Dahl's drawings are lively and add a lot to the action, the photographs and letters he provides are less successful. The text includes graphic depictions of teachers beating students with wooden canes, which could upset younger readers.

Darren is smitten with the spider and returns to steal her. When Steve is bitten by her, only Mr. Crepsley has an antidote to her poison.

This year, however, Nickel Bay Nick's strangely absent during the run-up to Christmas, leaving people in the economically struggling town depressed. Enter Sam Brattle, an unhappy, troublemaking 11-year-old with a lengthy rap sheet of petty crimes, ranging from shoplifting to minor vandalism and assorted cruel pranks. When Sam mistakenly damages the house of a neighbor, the aggrieved Mr. Wells makes a deal with him: In exchange for Mr. Wells not reporting Sam's vandalism (and other crimes) to the police, Sam must spend his Christmas vacation helping Mr. Wells, who's temporarily in a wheelchair following an accident. The crusty, exacting Mr. Wells is the shadowy Nickel Bay Nick, but this year his injury prevented him from working his stealthy money magic around town. Now Sam must become Nickel Bay Nick, and in the 12 days after Christmas, learn the tricks and techniques Mr. Wells, a former government spy, imparts to complete various missions in Operation Christmas Rescue, while keeping his and Mr. Wells' identity a secret. Nothing's easy, and there's a chance of failure at every turn. But over the course of two weeks, the two learn much about each other and themselves.  
","Nickel Bay Nick is an engaging, well-written, and sometimes funny book that has plenty of heart. Author Dean Pitchford (best known for Captain Nobody) effectively puts us inside the mind of fifth grader Sam, who narrates his adventures as a secret Santa, dispensing hundred dollar bills to strangers around the town of Nickel Bay at the behest of a mysterious neighbor. Sam's a complex kid -- physically fragile due to a heart transplant when he was 4; unhappy at home since his mother divorced his dad; strongly influenced by a criminally minded eighth grader who's always getting him into trouble; filled with self-loathing and lacking in self-confidence.
All of Sam's fears, insecurities, doubts, and anger come through in his narration, but so does his fundamental goodness and compassion. His adventures in clandestine philanthropy are exciting and at times nerve-wracking, as each mission to give away the money becomes progressively more difficult. The unpredictable ending's highly satisfying and surprisingly emotional. Kids will have no trouble relating to Sam's ups and downs.     ","Parents need to know that Nickel Bay Nick is a Christmas-themed coming-of-age novel about troubled and troublemaking Sam Brattle, 11, who gets a chance to redeem himself when he's blackmailed by a mysterious neighbor to perform secret acts of charity around their economically depressed town. Sam's done a lot of bad things around town, from shoplifting to vandalism to malicious pranks, and he views himself as an under-achieving loser. But deep down he's a sensitive soul, and the story of how he salvages his small town's Christmas, told in his voice, charts his slow transformation in the right direction. There's considerable fibbing and subterfuge involved in his good deeds, and he does some extremely dangerous things (such as hanging onto the back of a moving truck), but the cause is noble and it's hard not to root for Sam, who's had a lot of tough breaks in life.

Blood and Chocolate,Sensual and suspenseful werewolf fantasy for mature teens.,"When a rogue werewolf makes a forbidden human kill it puts a whole pack in jeopardy. They're burned out of their reclusive home and forced into the suburbs, where they try to quietly assimilate. Sixteen-year-old Vivian's adjustment is the hardest, having lost her father, the head of the pack, in the fire and suddenly finding herself in high school and attracted to Adrian, a fully human boy. Despite her mother's reservations and the acting out of some possessive \""cousins,\"" she falls for him and starts hanging out with his crowd. Just as she gets brave enough to even think about revealing her big secret to him, a rogue wolf kills again. And Vivian fears that what she doesn't remember about the night before could put her at the scene of the crime.
","It's funny how a 264-page stand-alone fantasy read is such a novelty now; let's hope mature fantasy fans don't pass this one over, because there's no tantalizing follow-up. BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE will draw in readers who like suspense, a bit of mystery, and a little bit of voyeurism to go with it. The author makes no apologies for the animal instincts of the pack and even shows the beauty in this more sensually charged culture. It's actually what makes Vivian and Adrian's relationship woes humorously refreshing; sweet, perfect boyfriend meets a girl who wishes he'd stop lighting candles around his room and bite her neck already.
	While readers are hoping they can possibly work out their cultural divide, Vivian and the pack's troubles mount, the mystery heats up, and Adrian ends up in mortal danger. Yes, all that's wrapped up beautifully and economically in 264 pages. Ah, the good old days.","Parents need to know that this lauded werewolf novel, published in 1997, has been banned by a number of libraries in the past for its sexual content. At the book's center are great messages about taking pride in who you are and embracing your place in the world, but yes, there's definitely a lot of sensuality to go with it. The werewolf pack strips in front of each other to change into wolves, sleeps around, and there's talk about how sex is better rough, and when you're partially changed into animals. The main character, teenage Vivian, is dating a human boy and frustrated that he's taking things slowly. But there are no graphic sex scenes, just plenty of talk and some kissing. There are a few graphic violent moments, though, where werewolves fight each other (the word ""entrails"" comes up), human bodies are discovered, and a severed hand drops out of someone's bed. Language can get a little rough too, with a few instances of ""f--k"" and a fair amount of everything else. Vivian drinks heavily in one scene and blacks out.

As in the first book, this is filled with fascinating photos, diagrams, maps, and lots more to support the rich plot. The author presents a mix of science and science fiction in great detail, and readers will enjoy taking a break from the action to pore over them. For young lovers of action who are looking for something with a little more intellectual heft, this treat shouldn't be missed.","Parents need to know that there's a fair amount of violence here, though it's not as graphic or terrifying as the previous book in this adventure series. There are explosions, sword-fighting, battles, deaths, skeletons, a mention of a character having had her finger cut off. A teen character and others drink, and cigars are smoked. The siblings are reflexively disobedient and defiant, often putting themselves and others in extreme danger -- but they are equally competent as well as very brave and clever. Readers will cheer them on as they try to find their parents -- and stay alive.

"Merry Christmas, Splat!",Fluffy cat in a fluffy and sweet holiday tale.,"When Splat asks for a really big present, his sister gives him last-minute doubts: “Are you sure you’ve been good?” Worried, Splat tackles jobs that don’t need doing in hopes of ensuring he’ll measure up. He stays up all night, waiting for Santa so he can tell him how good he’s been. But when Christmas morning dawns, there’s been no sign of Santa. Was Splat good enough?
","As with his earlier books featuring endearing Splat, Rob Scotton’s story plays second fiddle to the fun illustrations. Here they play well to the deadpan text. Kids will giggle at the alarm in his mother’s face when Splat announces his intentions. And the spread where Santa slips, unnoticed, right past the wide-eyed cat will have them in stitches. The color palette -- mostly black-and-white with subtle coloring and bright pops of red and green -- adds to the appeal.
	Kids will relate to Splat’s worries -- and his wish for a big gift. Grownups worn out by the holiday gimme-gimmes may wince.
Whimsical artwork is full of delightful touches.","Parents need to know there’s nothing to worry about in this holiday story. Parents might grumble at Splat’s focus on getting a big present, but that provides an opening to talk with your kids about the value of a gift.

"Antsy Ansel: Ansel Adams, a Life in Nature","Artful, relatable bio offers intro to photographer's work.","ANTSY ANSEL: ANSEL ADAMS, A LIFE IN NATURE tells the story of American nature photographer and environmentalist Ansel Adams. When he was a child in the early days of the 1900s, he had difficulty focusing in school. His father arranged for him to be schooled at home and encouraged him to play outside, in their home near San Francisco. Ansel studied piano and considered pursuing a career in music, but a trip when he was 14 to Yosemite Valley proved inspiring, as did the gift of a camera. After working as a commercial photographer, he returned to Yosemite, and his photographs of nature became famous.
","This artful and relatable biography of photographer Ansel Adams begins in his ""antsy"" childhood, emphasizing his love of nature, while introducing his life work photographing our national parks. Antsy Ansel: Ansel Adams, a Life in Nature spans Adams' entire life, but lingers on his childhood, when he had difficulty focusing and felt ""like a fly buzzing inside a jar."" The text communicates Adams' passions with fizzy, rhythmic language, and the eye-catching collage art gives texture to the boy, the dramatic outdoor vistas, and the period details of the era.
Still, readers might wish that the book was weighted a bit more toward the work and photography itself. The text references Adams ""giving voice to the voiceless and giving politics a purpose,"" but we're not sure how his work had political or social consequences. And the few examples of his actual photographs in the art are curiously muddy in this otherwise strong celebration of Ansel Adams.","Parents need to know that Cindy Jenson-Elliott's Antsy Ansel: Ansel Adams, a Life in Nature introduces the American naturalist photographer to a young audience. The bio starts in childhood, when ""Antsy Ansel"" was a hyperactive student who came into focus when allowed to explore the outdoors. An early trip to Yosemite and the gift of a camera planted the seeds for his lifelong work as a photographer capturing light and the rugged beauty of nature, particularly in our national parks. Antsy Ansel can be particularly inspiring for kids who have difficulty focusing or who have an interest in the visual arts.

Voices,"Well-wrought fantasy explores pacifism, violence.","The Ansuls, a peaceful people who venerate wisdom, are living under occupation of the warrior Alds. Memer, conceived when her mother was raped by an Ald soldier, vows to avenge her mother and her people. But when a gifted poet named Orrec and his wife Gry arrive, she begins to see her country's plight with new understanding.
","Le Guin maintains her signature lyricism here, but the melancholy of the first book, Gifts, is replaced by sometimes-shocking scenes of the aftermath of cruelty.
This is not a fast-moving novel; Le Guin concerns herself more with the inner struggle of the conflicted heroine than with the intricacies of the rebellion. The result is a rich but challenging exploration of violence, justice, faith, and honor. For some young adult readers, the book will be too slow to capture their interest. Others will be upset by the description of the torments of the Ansul people, including the torture that crippled the Waylord, Memer's caregiver. Readers don't need to have read Gifts before tackling this book, but those who have will be happy to reacquaint themselves with Orrec and Gry, who arrive early in the book.","Parents need to know that this sequel to Le Guin's Gifts contains more mature content than its predecessor and may be too much for some kids. Violence, descriptions of the effects of torture, and matter-of-fact mentions of rape are scattered throughout the book, although never gratuitously. For those kids old enough for its mature themes, the book is a capable exploration of violence, culture clashes, and seeing the enemy from the other side.

Nowhere Boy,"Riveting friendship tale set against terror, refugee crisis.","In NOWHERE BOY, a teen named Ahmed is escaping his war-torn country by boat, trying to reach the coast of Greece so that he and his father can enter Europe. Meanwhile, an American kid named Max has relocated to Brussels, Belgium, with his family, and has just been informed by his parents that he will not go to the English-speaking school that his sister is attending. He's going to be enrolled in the local French-speaking school without knowing any French. On top of that, he's going to be repeating sixth grade. Unhappily, he starts his school year with a leaky fountain pen and zero friends. Meanwhile, Ahmed is struggling to find a place to sleep in a new country. Their worlds are about to collide in a story of friendship that knows no borders.
","Author Katherine Marsh expertly interweaves urgent political topics nd exciting adventure in this compelling story of two very different kinds of immigrants. Max is n American teen whose parents took jobs in Belgium and moved the family there. Ahmed is an utterly helpless teen refugee without a country. They are both grappling with an age-old question: Where do displaced people belong? Together, they courageously stand up for human rights, even if they break the rules. Their friendship is based on need, but their devotion is based on human kindness. The problems in Nowhere Boy are real in the truest sense of the word, as the plight of refugees and immigrants are in the news constantly. The only flaw in this engrossing story is that the adults are not very relatable. Ahmed's father is an exception, but Max's parents are distant and two-dimensional, and the teachers and other adults have agendas and float about like ghosts. Even real-life, self-involved parents have some characteristics that make them human. Max's parents don't feel real, which steals a little shine from the resolution t the end of the book. Still, Nowhere Boy succeeds by striking important chords of compassion, friendship, and hope in troubled times.","Parents need to know that Katherine Marsh's book Nowhere Boy examines themes of racism, fear of foreigners, terrorism, and global politics through the lens of 13-year-old American Max's and 14-year-old Syrian Ahmed's experiences. Big topics like fear of deportation, grieving loved ones lost because of war, nd the triumph of beating the system mix with everyday middle school issues like having a mean sister nd fitting in at school. There are explicit details of bombings (including those in Syria that killed Ahmed's mother and sisters) and descriptions of terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015 and in Brussels, Belgium, in 2016. Ahmed's nightmares feature corpses, and images of refugee children washing up on beaches are described.

"The Caldera: Brotherband Chronicles, Book 7",Slow start builds to exciting with pirates and a volcano.,"In THE CALDERA, members of the Heron Brotherband are vying for the title of Skandia's best warrior, or Maktig. Stig, the first mate, is the one to watch in the competition, but his chance at glory is thwarted when his absentee father, Olaf, sneaks into his house one night asking for his immediate help. Olaf was the head of the palace guard in Byzantos to the south nd was dismissed when the teen emperor-to-be, Constantus, was kidnapped by pirates. Olaf needs a fighting ship to rescue Constantus and get his post back. Stig and the rest of the Brotherband, sorry to miss the competition but keen on a new adventure, load up the ship and start the long journey south. After a few river-pirate attacks, they arrive in the bustling port of Byzantos. The plan was to gather information about the kidnappers at the taverns before shipping out again, but then Olaf is arrested. Good thing for Olaf he's with the Heron Brotherband. It won't be the first time they've broken someone out of prison, nor will it be the last.
","Great news for Brotherband fans: We're on voyage seven with the Heron crew and, with the help of more nasty pirates and a lava-spewing, rock-hurling volcano, it's still a worthwhile adventure. (We're not giving anything away about the explosive finale when it's right on the cover.) Readers can expect the usual meandering story opening with Stig, Ulf, and Wulf preparing for the Maktig (warrior) competition. Luckily the warm-up doesn't last as long as it does in some Brotherband books. And Ulf and Wulf twin antics are always a fun diversion.
If you enjoyed Book 3, The Hunters, you get to revisit some old River Dan pirate haunts on the way to Byzantos. And Jesper's lock picks, used so skillfully in The Slaves of Socorro, get dusted off again here. What adventure fan doesn't love a prison break? Even as action builds, more time could have been spent on the difficult relationship between Stig and his father, Olaf. It's a missed opportunity to add more depth to the story.","Parents need to know that The Caldera is the seventh book in the Brotherband Chronicles, the companion series to John Flanagan's popular Ranger's Apprentice series. After taking on malicious slave traders in Book 4, a cult of assassins in Book 5, and ruthless island warriors in Book 6, the crew of the Heron battles pirates to recover a hostage emperor-to-be. There's plenty of pirate fighting, but only once is it gory: when a man is sliced in half with a sword. Spears, knives, swords, arrows, darts, and a big cannon-type weapon do damage. A few ships sink, one after being rammed and ransacked. Injuries sustained among the Brotherband include an arrow to the arm and near-drownings. A volcano spews rocks and lava and causes a dangerous tidal wave. Lessening the violence some: When the Brotherband come up against unarmed opponents, they knock them out instead of causing lasting harm. Overall, the members of the Heron Brotherband, under the strong leadership of the captain, Hal, are loyal to one another and are a great example of teamwork and ingenuity in action. In the scenes of drinking, the Brotherband always choose coffee instead. The first mate, Stig, faces the disappointing father who abandoned him as a child. He handles it with grace, remembering that even without a strong father figure in his life, he always has the support of his friends.

With the support of his Mexican parents, he followed their special recipe for success: ""Identify your goal, determine how far you are from achieving it, and create a plan to reach it. Then, do well in school and work hard."" José added his own secret ingredient to that recipe: ""Never ever give up!"" After earning degrees in electrical engineering, José applied to NASA and was rejected -- 11 times. To better his chances of entering the program, José became a pilot, was certified as a scuba diver, and learned Russian. NASA finally accepted his 12th application, and he became an astronaut, blasting off into space aboard the space shuttle Discovery and working at the International Space Station.

No Talking,Ear-to-ear-grinningly delightful school story.,"Dave's fifth grade class is called ""The Unshushables"" by their teachers because of their constant talking. His grade is also unusually immature when it comes to boys and girls getting along with each other.
When Dave reads that Gandhi didn't talk for one day each week, he is intrigued and decides to try it out himself. But he only makes it until lunch before getting into an argument with Lynsey, the leader of the girls, and they end up making a bet: two days of no talking, boys against girls. Whichever side talks less, wins. Not talking, though, is harder than it seems, and has all sorts of unintended consequences -- including a confrontation with the principal, who has been trying to get them to stop talking for years.
","OK, let's just state it baldly: Author Andrew Clements is a genius. Like this one, his books are short, easy to read, and ear-to-ear-grinningly delightful. They have no villains, sex, violence, drugs, or off-color language or humor. And they are thought-provoking, funny, often moving, deeply wise, and diamond-sharp in their clarity and understanding of the world of middle-grade children.
Clements' classic is Frindle, but NO TALKING is up to that standard. He packs enough intellectual and emotional depth to keep avid readers thinking and discussing, and his straightforward, conversational style will appeal to reluctant readers. The content will keep discussion groups hopping, while the fluid joy of the story keeps individual readers and listeners grinning with pleasure.","Parents need to know that there is nothing to be concerned about here, and lots to cheer.

I Dissent: Ruth Bader Ginsburg Makes Her Mark,Inspiring bio of Supreme Court justice empowers girls.,"I DISSENT: RUTH BADER GINSBURG MAKES HER MARK tells the story of how Ruth Bader Ginsburg rose to become a Supreme Court justice. Born into a Jewish family in 1930s Brooklyn, she grew up when girls were expected to raise families but not participate in the workforce, and encountered prejudice against Jews and other minorities. But Ruth's mother supported her ambitions and education, and Ruth went on to attend law school, where she met her husband and started a family, sharing household and child-rearing duties, an unconventional arrangement at the time. When law firms wouldn't hire her, she worked as a law professor and argued cases about equality for women. President Jimmy Carter appointed her as a judge in Washington, D.C., nd Bill Clinton appointed her to the Supreme Court, the first Jewish woman on the nation's highest court, where she continued to fight for equality. A few meaty pages of afterword include more detail about Ginsburg's life and the important court cases she influenced.
","This bio of Justice Ginsburg is supremely inspiring, breaking down complicated ideas about the constitution, legal system, and issues of equality for young readers while celebrating Ginsburg's life. Levy cleverly pulls out words that show Ginsburg disagreeing with the status quo and organizes the narrative around them. The young Ruth in I Dissent: Ruth Bader Ginsburg Makes Her Mark not only dissented, she also ""protested,"" ""objected,"" ""disapproved,"" ""resisted and persisted,"" and ""did not concur"" -- which arms young girls with a vocabulary to use when they run up against opposition.

We Planted a Tree,A poem to inspire young tree huggers everywhere.,"The story begins when two families from opposite sides of the world each plant a tree in the backyard. Years pass, and the trees grow, as do the families. Meanwhile the reader learns how trees grow and what they do to benefit people all over the world, and the earth itself. In the end, the children have grown, and we see them standing, happy and hopeful, with their families around the tree they each put into the earth.

The Cat Who Walked Across France,Kids will cheer cat on as he makes his way home.,"The cat of the title lives with an old woman in a stone house by the edge of the sea in southern France. When the woman dies, the cat and all of her belongings are shipped north to where the woman was born. A map on the back cover shows that they had been living on the Mediterranean in St. Tropez and that the cat was shipped north past Paris to Rouen.
The cat?s longing to be home is so strong that he sets out on a long, solitary trek across France. He travels through cities and in the countryside, occasionally encountering kindhearted people, but no one takes him in. His strong instincts and memories of life by the sea draw him on toward the south. He makes it back home at last to the stone house at the edge of the sea. Thin but healthy, he is taken in by the children who have moved into the house.

From the cat's contentment in his home by the sea with the old woman, to his loss of both woman and home, and then to his sometimes harrowing experiences as he travels across France, and finally the intense pleasure of finding his home welcoming once again, the reader is by the cat's side for it all. Reading stories is for children, like adults, a way to experience life and feelings that might not be available to us otherwise. This story has much to offer in that regard.
With full-color paintings in beautifully bold Mediterranean hues, the contrast between the huge expanse of the country with the smallness of the cat emphasizes the power of a strong spirit in search of its proper place. For the determined cat there is a tremendous difference between home and not home, one worth risking everything for. After his long trip, readers will share his relief and satisfaction to be home again.","Parents need to know that in addition to the picaresque aspect of this cat's tale, the story explores the sometimes confounding, mysterious impulse of animals (and by extension, humans) to return to the place of their birth or childhood.

","Henry Finds His Word is fun and funny, cute as a pudgy-wudgy baby. But it's also stealthily accurate about language acquisition, which adds to its pleasures. When babies babble (""beep boop""), they're trying out sounds nd also learning important conversational skills such as turn taking. Mothers and other emotionally important caregivers know this instinctively nd talk to babies in goo-goo, ga-ga hyper-inflected speech known as ""Motherese."" And youngsters are particularly motivated to talk when they need to communicate. All this is implicit in the story, never dry and academic. Kids can have fun remembering how they themselves learned language nd how their families encouraged them.","Parents need to know that Henry Finds His Word is a fun book about babies learning to talk. Though the target preschool reader may already be talking a blue streak, families can reminiscence about the reader's babyhood nd share happy family memories. In the story, baby Henry has not yet said his first actual word, though he's readying himself by doing lots of babbling. Then one day, frustrated and needing help, he vocalizes his first recognizable word, one he soon finds comes in very handy for lots of situations: ""Mama!""

Dear Pope Francis: The Pope Answers Letters from Children Around the World,"Kids' questions, pope's answers offer lots to think about.","DEAR POPE FRANCIS is a collection of illustrated letters from children around the world -- including Syria, Kenya, Peru, China, and the U.S.A. -- and the pope's answers to their questions, from the theological to the everyday. Pope Francis is the first Jesuit pope, and Jesuit institutions in 26 countries solicited children's letters for this project and collected 259. Of those, Jesuit priest Antonio Spadaro, director of the Rome magazine La Civilta Cattolica, presented 30 to the pope. According to a note at the back, the two men spent an hour and a half together, with the pontiff thoughtfully considering and answering each question and Spadaro recording his responses. Spadaro then transcribed what the pope said for the book. The pope often comments on the colorful drawings in the letters, noticing telling details about the kids' lives. The book's cover illustration is from a letter sent by a 9-year-old girl in Belgium.
","This warm and charming collection of kids' letters and the pope's simple but meaningful responses help the pontiff seem more human and God more accessible. The children ask all kinds of questions, from practical to profound (""What did God do before the world was made?"" ""Our deceased relatives, can they see us from heaven?"" ""How can God hear us?"") and the pope's responses are gentle, direct, reassuring, encouraging, and humble. With a light touch and impish humor, he also reveals things about himself, including that he really likes soccer and played it (""but I don't have a nimble foot""), that ""as a young man, I liked to dance the tango,"" and that as a child he wanted to be a butcher when he grew up. The tone of his responses is that of a friendly, compassionate uncle, not some pompous high official or strict cleric.
While many questions and answers will resonate with curious children and Christians of various stripes, a Catholic perspective colors the endeavor, with references to catechism, mass, first communion, and the stigmata. The overall themes are fairly universal, but some of the vocabulary and specifics will have more appeal and familiarity for Catholics.","Parents need to know that Dear Pope Francis is a charming picture book by the pope himself, in which he answers 30 illustrated letters from children around the world who pose a range of questions, from ""Why do you wear that tall hat?"" to ""If you could do one miracle, what would it be?"" His answer to the latter is, ""I would heal children. I've never been able to understand why children suffer."" The pope speaks in everyday language that kids can understand. When asked where his favorite place to pray is, he names a couple of places but adds, ""I can also pray while walking, or even going to the dentist."" Some tough subjects include his wish that ""there were no longer any slaves in this world"" and a story of a man committing suicide by jumping off a bridge, causing his wife to worry that he'll go to hell for it. The pope tells the letter writer that St. John Vianney assured the wife, ""Look, between the bridge and the river, there is the mercy of God.""

"Black Heart: Curse Workers, Book 3",Entertaining but predictable final installment.,"Seventeen-year-old Cassel Sharpe comes from a family of curse workers (people capable of magic who have the ability to con anyone with just one touch of their hand). Curse workers can make others lose their memories, fall in love, die, or, in Cassel's case, transform into any other object. The federal government offers Cassel a bargain for immunity from all of his past crimes if he agrees to work for them (the \""good\"" guys). The offer seems pretty good, considering that Cassel's corrupt brothers had conned him into murdering people, then erased all memory of his criminal offenses. While Cassel is torn between protecting his family and the girl he loves, he learns that sometimes working for the \""good\"" guys is no different from working for the \""bad\"" ones.
","BLACK HEART, the final installment in the CURSE WORKERS trilogy, doesn't offer much surpise or suspense, unlike the first two books, which left readers hanging on every word. The major characters, initially complex and impulsive, are a little dull and predictable in the finale. True, they've grown into more confident, self-aware young adults than they were in their younger years, but they lack the enjoyable witty banter and playful language that originally pulled readers in.
But Black Heart is an entertaining book nonetheless, and fans will enjoy its small details: descriptions of mob mansions, fancy clothes, and extravagant cars. Fans will also be happy with the ending and appeased by the one small shocker that Black has in store.","Parents need to know that Black Heart is less violent than its predecessors in the Curse Workers trilogy, White Cat and Red Glove. Two people in this final installment get shot; one dies. A shooting scene includes gory details, but readers are told ahead of time that the injury isn't serious. Violence, when it happens, is reactionary or accidental rather than premeditated, making the small scuffles easier to stomach than in the prior installments. Teen boys drink alcohol and get drunk, then have a terrible hangover. A teen couple has sex.

Greta's Story: The Schoolgirl Who Went on Strike to Save the Planet,Accessible intro to Swedish teen climate activist's work.,"GRETA'S STORY: THE SCHOOLGIRL WHO WENT ON STRIKE TO SAVE THE PLANET finds Swedish teen Greta Thunberg increasingly convinced of the potentially planet-destroying effects of climate change as catastrophic fires rage across Europe. She's soon studying up obsessively on the issue, trying to find something she can do to prevent global catastrophe, and shocked that politicians seem not at all interested. Inspired by the examples of U.S. civil rights activist Rosa Parks and, more recently, the students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who became gun control activists after experiencing a mass school shooting, she cuts school, parks herself at the school's entrance with a handwritten sign ""School Strike for the Climate,"" takes a picture, and puts it on Instagram. Kids around the world see her posts and join the effort. Things take off from there.
","Italian author Valentina Camerini's accessible narrative introduces teen activist Greta Thunberg to a middle grade audience, addressing climate change, being on the autism spectrum, and social media strategy. Greta's Story moves along quickly from the hot summer of 2018 that changed the then-15-year-old's life, driving her to launch a climate strike at school and publicize it on Instagram. Kids with an interest in climate change or activism around some other cause will find a lot of information and probably some inspirational ideas here.
Readers dealing with autism spectrum disorder, which in Greta's case seems to be both a disability and a superpower, and depression, which she overcame to do her work, may find her story especially relatable.","Parents need to know that Greta's Story: The Girl Who Went on Strike to Save the Planet is an illustrated middle-grade introduction to teen environmental activist (and Time magazine's Person of the Year for 2019) Greta Thunberg. It was first published in Italian and later in a growing number of translations around the world. The book offers a lot of age-appropriate information about climate change, being on the autism spectrum (which affected Greta's becoming obsessed with the issue), and how she used social media to bring worldwide attention to her cause. The pivotal event is Greta's deciding to cut school to bring attention to the issue of climate change. Parents may want to discuss if, when, and why this might be appropriate. The story, by Italian author Valentina Camerini, is translated  by Moreno Giovannoni and illustrated appealingly by Veronica ""Veci"" Carratello.  Supplemental sections offer links to Greta's online posts, information about climate change, and practical steps individuals can take to reduce their negative impact.

Anna and the French Kiss,Sweet love story has romantic Parisian backdrop.,"Anna's upset when her dad ships her off to an exclusive boarding school in Paris for her senior year, but she quickly meets a good group of smart friends -- including handsome, charming Etienne St. Clair -- who show her the city's beauty. An aspiring film critic, Anna loves the city's many theaters (also the pastries!), but she also soon realizes she's in love with a boy who has a serious girlfriend. Is she wrong to believe that he has feelings for her, too?
","ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS is worth reading just for the beautiful descriptions of Paris and all the wonderful food there. With his English accent, stormy relationship with his father, and small, thoughtful gestures toward Anna, Etienne's a great romantic lead who'll have readers swooning, too. Parents will appreciate that there's a genuine friendship between the two protagonists, and that Anna even admits, ""It's okay if St. Clair and I never become more than friends. His friendship alone has strengthened me in a way that no one else's has. He swept me from my room and showed me independence."" The story may go on a bit long, with too many extra storylines, but when these two inevitably get together, ooh la la!","Parents need to know that Anna and the French Kiss by Stephanie Perkins (Lola and the Boy Next Door) takes place in a Parisian boarding school, where the resident teens swear, get drunk, and have sex. Although Anna's a virgin, she and her love interest do spend the night in the same bed. She also has some pretty intense makeout sessions. But there's a really sweet love story here: Anna and Etienne have authentic chemistry and friendship before starting a relationship, which could prove a good model for teens. Also, readers will enjoy the depictions of Paris, and perhaps want to discuss whether Anna's unflattering comparisons of America with Parisian life feel authentic.

"Frozen: Heart of Dread, Book 1",Dark series start an unusal mix of dystopian and fantasy.,"Nat and Wes are teens struggling to survive in a frozen world filled with poisoned oceans, a mostly illiterate population, and widespread cancer deaths. Working as a blackjack dealer in New Vegas, Nat must hide the fact that she is \""marked\"" -- her bright green eyes and birthmark make her part of a new and feared species of people who can do amazing things like move objects with their minds or weave illusions. (At the start of the book, \""Nat had no idea how to use her power or how to control it\""). She gets to know Wes, a former soldier now working as a mercenary, when she contracts him to take her out of the city; she has a map to a mythical paradise known as the Blue. But to get there, Nat and Wes must draw upon all their strengths -- both human and otherworldly -- and depend on each other to cross the dark water, face slave traders, and keep their controlling government from destroying the Blue.
","FROZEN kicks off a series, and the husband-and-wife co-authors lay on the details pretty thick in describing the inner workings of the chilling future world they've imagined. The book's unusual mix of dystopian and fantasy elements may be the right match for some, but others may find that details about marked people, dragons, and a zombie-like species feel out of sync with the other dark but more realistic details described along the way. (For example, trashbergs fill the ocean, people often speak in text language, and drinking water is a precious -- and expensive -- beverage.)
Even so, Nat and Wes are sympathetic, strong, and heroic characters, and readers are sure to stay engaged as these likable -- if familiar -- protagonists face constant peril to get to the Blue. And the authors certainly leave plenty unresolved to encourage readers to return for the next installment. ","Parents need to know that Frozen is the first book in the Heart of Dread dystopian fantasy series by Melissa de la Cruz and her husband, Michael Johnston. In addition to some kissing and romance, there's some fairly intense violence: For example, the teen protagonists are shot at by the military, face sadistic slave traders who starve them and torture other people on their boat (including hanging a small child, nearly to death), and there's a big battle at sea involving lots of shooting, smoke, and even a fire-breathing dragon. Ultimately, Nat and Wes are true heroes who go out of their way to help other people, do the right thing, and fight to save what's special about the world.

The Perfect Thanksgiving,"Thanksgiving isn't about having the ""perfect"" day.","On alternating pages, the young narrator, along with two talking turkeys (one ""real"" and the other a cutout finger turkey), compare her own family's Thanksgiving celebration with that of her friend Abigail Archer's family. Abigail's family is quiet, polite, and formal, while the narrator's is loud, rather wild, and informal. Abigail's mother serves homemade pies with fancy whipped cream swirls, while the narrator's mother serves store-bought pie and jello mold with no whipped cream. Admittedly quite different in style, both families are loving and kind, so the narrator gives them both marks of ""ultra perfect.""
","The author of this colorful, heartwarming story compares and contrasts a ""perfect"" family's Thanksgiving Day with that of a more ragtag crew. She finds them to be equally good, of course, because of the love that is apparent in each family: It is not the family's style that counts, but the feelings between the family members.
The humorous story is written from the child's point of view and focuses on just the sorts of things that a child might notice. As the young narrator goes down her list of things that are right about Abigail's family and wrong about her own, the reader can tell that she fears that her family will not make the grade. Happily, in the end, she can see beneath the contrasting exteriors of the two families to the close-knit feelings in each. The gouache, colored pencil, and collage art is zany, contemporary, and attractive.","Parents need to know that this story has a clear moral: that the success of a holiday celebration depends more on what you feel than on what you see (or taste).

With scraps of cloth, she finds a way to sew to freedom. Through this true story, Clara's courage and dedication to reach freedom will engage older children.
 ","Deborah Hopkinson writes in a compelling and confident voice this thought-provoking true story of a slave girl who sews a map on a quilt. Listeners feel as if they are inside Clara's head, hoping and working to freedom.
""It was like being in a dream you already dreamed,"" explains Sweet Clara as she follows the landmarks to freedom that other slaves had told her about, landmarks she had sewn into her freedom quilt. Clara's determination is a trait all listeners will admire. Harsh facts about slavery, such as beatings of runaways, are appropriately downplayed in this book aimed at young listeners. The textured paintings by James Ransome add richness and depth to the story. Visible brush strokes and warm tones are used to express the dignity and sadness of the slaves. When Aunt Rachel's hand traces the path of Clara's stitches on the freedom quilt, one can imagine the feel of the fabric under her fingertips.","Parents need to know that this book downplays the horrors of slavery in consideration of its young audience.

Fat Cat,Girl-geek makeover tale with a great healthy eating message.,"Catherine Locke has always had a love affair with junk food, Matt, and science. When Matt betrayed her in seventh grade it ended their friendship, but not her love of food and science. Cat became \""Fat Cat\"" and put all her energy into beating Matt at least once in a science fair. When a tough, make-it-or-break-it science class project looked like it would break her she got prehistoric with it. She vowed to live like early human ancestors on a basic foods diet and no modern conveniences. Giving up Snickers and Diet Coke was tough, but what she learned about food, her body, and herself was worth so much more.
","FAT CAT took a tried and true premise -- fat chick gets skinny and popular by senior year -- and added an interesting angle to it. Author Robin Brande created a story that uses science and a commitment to research to motivate ""Fat Cat"" to get thin and healthy. No crash diets, no dangerous exercise, just good old-fashioned (caveman inspired) healthy eating and prehistoric transportation: her feet.
Readers will love Cat's perserverance and identify with her pain from both being called fat and giving up her junky diet of diet soda and chocolate. Hopefully teens will read this novel and realize they can take control of their own diets while learning how processed food can affect their mood and bodies. Cat's story eventually gets sidetracked by standard boy/girl drama, and it's disappointing that her experiment detoured into some Pretty Woman-style shopping experiences and boy-magnent experiements, but overall the message is positive and inspiring.","Parents need to know that there isn't much to be worried about in this novel about a teen giving up processed foods for a school project. There's some kissing, heavy petting, and a discussion of waiting to have sex, plus a few instances of name calling. Mostly the main character sets a good example by embarking on a positive mission of self-discovery that makes her a whole lot healthier in the process.

Far Far Away,"Clever, creepy modern fairy tale with irresistible heroes.","In the small village of Never Better, Jeremy Johnson Johnson has been haunted by the ghost of Jacob Grimm since he was a boy. The two have become close friends, but because Jeremy apparently talks to himself and often blurts out strange bits of information, his classmates and the villagers ridicule him. Jeremy's life changes the day wild and beautiful Ginger decides to befriend him. When Ginger invites Jeremy to join her in playing a prank on the town baker, their bond is cemented and Jeremy begins to veer from the careful path of solemn study that Jacob has laid out for him. Ginger comes up with a plan to help Jeremy save his family's bookstore, which launches the two of them on an adventure that may help them solve the mystery of the village's disappearing children -- or lead to their own deaths.
","Though the story takes place in a modern American village, it evokes the feel of a classic fairy tale, the kind where truly horrible things may indeed happen along the way to happily ever after. Woven throughout is a rich respect for stories and storytelling, but the real strengths of this book lie in its creepy undertones and its cast of complex characters who are always more than what they appear to be: Bullies have deep emotions, loving parents are neglectful, and a well meaning ghost sworn to protect offers misguided advice. Author McNeal deftly plants hints of the very real dangers to come as villagers vaguely wonder why so many children are disappearing, all the while munching on the town baker's delicious Prince cakes.
Jeremy is an instantly likable hero readers will root for despite -- or maybe because of -- his initially humble appearance. As his unlikely friendship with the daring Ginger blossoms and their lives take a distinctly Hansel-and-Gretel turn, the courage and cleverness they inspire in each other is worthy of any of the old tales.
 ","Parents need to know that Far Far Away takes place in the present but has the feel of a classic fairy tale. It opens with foreshadowing that something awful will happen, which gives the novel a creepy tone throughout. Main character Jeremy has been ostracized by his classmates because of his strangeness, but he doesn't let the teasing change who he is. Three teens are held captive by a man who has appeared harmless and friendly for most of the story. They are starved and mentally tortured, and eventually the man tries to kill them. Main character Jeremy is teased by his classmates because of his strangeness, but he doesn't let it change who he is.

Author-illustrator Anna Dewdney is a master at rhyme, which is never as easy as it looks.

Keeping Score,A child's view of '50s Dodgers and the Korean war.,"Maggie Fortini has been a fiercely loyal Brooklyn Dodgers fan for as long as she can remember. But since her own brother, Joey-Mick, doesn't take her interest in baseball seriously, she finds an ally and friend in Jim, the fireman at her dad's work. It's Jim who teaches her to record baseball statistics, or ""keep score."" For a long time, Maggie's ups and downs come with the Dodgers' wins and losses until the Korean War begins and a thing like baseball begins to seem, well, more important than ever.
","You don't have to like baseball to be a fan of Linda Sue Park. But if you read her Newbery Award-winner A Single Shard, you probably already are. Her semi-autobiographical novel KEEPING SCORE cleverly juxtaposes the rivalry among three '50s New York baseball teams against the conflict of the Korean War.
Through the eyes of Maggie, Park creates a detailed world of 1950s Brooklyn. As readers, we only know what Maggie knows and so events such as the Korean War and even Dodgers games that have long since become legend still play out with suspense. We also experience the frustration of being a kid, when your only information about life comes from adults who don't always tell you the whole truth. Thus, the fact that Maggie doesn't understand the reasons behind the Korean War is made especially poignant when we realize that the adults around her who have all the facts probably don't understand it either.","Parents need to know that several violent events are referred to, though not in detail, including the story of when Maggie's dad shatters his leg on duty as a firefighter. More significant is a scene recalling an incident during the Korean War when innocent civilians -- including children -- are shot while hiding underneath a bridge. Neither account is graphic, but Park does mention in the Author's Note that the bridge tragedy is ""loosely"" based on something that happened during the actual war.

When his family's Internet is cut off for a year due to his transgressions, Trent runs away to London rather than face his father's unemployment, his mother's failing health, and his younger sister's plunging school grades. He falls in with a group of squatters refurbishing an abandoned pub, as well as activists and artists working to overturn a copyright law that would turn millions of young people into felons overnight. Rechristened as Cecil B. DeVil, Trent learns how to use technology and art to effect political change.
","PIRATE CINEMA is another volume in Cory Doctorow's series of novels about teenagers taking on the system, and it mostly maintains his high standards. The novel addresses issues that directly affect today's young readers, and it doesn't promote simplistic answers to most of the questions it raises. Trent's acclimation to life on the streets of London seems a little too easy, but the book in general stays within the realm of plausibility. Many readers will be exhilarated and moved by the amount of passion and intelligence that the highly diverse characters bring to their quest for justice.","Parents need to know that Pirate Cinema, by Cory Doctorow, paints a vivid picture of life on the streets in near-future London and features a cast of characters who operate outside the law.

His mother is passionate about the Catholic Church, and wants him to be a priest; his father is connected spiritually to the Ilano, the great plains of their state. A friend of the family is Ultima, a midwife and practitioner of magical healing and spells. Although greatly respected by Antonio and his parents, Ultima encourages his constant questions on the meaning of life and religion. Narciso, the town drunk, also seems to possess a mystical connection to the supernatural. A feud erupts between the mean-spirited Tenorio and several characters that ends in violence and death. Antonio comes of age very quickly in terms of moral conviction. 
","This marvelous book sold more than 300,000 copies essentially on word-of-mouth recommendation after it was published in 1972, and is now often required reading in school. It would be a mistake to call it an ""ethnic"" novel -- one of interest primarily to Latino readers. Like To Kill a Mockingbird, it has universal appeal as a story that brings to life a time, place, and customs chiefly from the point of view of a child. BLESS ME, ULTIMA is both lyrical and realistic, has many positive messages, and deals with extremely weighty and important issues.","Parents need to know that Bless Me, Ultima makes it quite explicit that morals are subjective and not absolute. Catholicism is treated reverently, but its long-held and sometimes contradictory beliefs are constantly questioned. At the same time, pagan magic is depicted more as a Native American passion for and connection to the earth and its elements than as witchcraft.

The Enchanted Castle,"Though dated, this still casts a potent spell.","Four spirited children find an enchanted ring and embark on magical adventures. The ring, though, seems to have a mind of its own, and never behaves as they expect it to, leading to danger, comedy, mystery, and even a little romance between the grown-up characters. Though a bit dated, Nesbit's book still casts a potent spell.
 ","Nesbit wrote ""surely the most wonderful books in the world,"" according to fantasy author Edward Eager; the magic is still here, though it has dimmed a bit over time. Almost 100 years have gone by since Jimmy told Kathleen, ""You're just like a girl,"" and modern readers who expect the boys to learn a lesson about their occasional sexist sneers will be disappointed. Still, for children who like to act out the stories they read, this is like a travel guide for the imagination.
Nesbit was a contemporary of Oz author L. Frank Baum, but her novels have an important difference: The magic takes place in the real world, leading to comical misunderstandings such as ringleader Gerald's absurd dialogue with one dreadfully refined Ugly Wugly. H.R. Millar's drawings extend the text well, giving believable and pleasing portraits of the characters and firmly establishing the Edwardian setting.","Parents need to know that this is a classic, though slightly dated.

The Year of the Three Sisters,Chinese girl visits U.S. in powerful friendship tale.,"In THE YEAR OF THE THREE SISTERS, Anna and her friend invite Fan, a young migrant worker from Beijing whom Anna met in a previous book, to their school for a year. Fan has a difficult life in China, and her adjustment to suburban Cincinnati isn't easy, especially when she's intent on studying all the time so she can help her family in China. Anna's sensitive to Fan's feelings and the cultural differences that might divide them, and she narrates her own ups and downs with middle school friendships.
","It's not easy to write an emotionally resonant and thoughtful story in the short format of a young middle grade novel, but The Year of the Three Sisters is a gem. Anna's an observant and sensitive narrator, and readers will relate to concerns about fitting in and friendships. The account of the girls' lives rings true, and the detail grounds them recognizably in Cincinnati -- trips to Graeter's ice cream, collecting buckeyes, mention of distinct Cincinnati neighborhoods. The spot illustrations by Patrice Barton are cheerful and charming and depict a multicultural group of friends, with Anna and other Chinese-American kids and families at the forefront.
The visiting girl from Beijing allows the book to introduce some broader, more socially conscious issues, with information about how the girls' lives differ, both culturally and economically. Frequent mention of the books Anna is reading is another plus.","Parents need to know that The Year of the Three Sisters is the fourth book in a well-regarded series for young readers by Andrea Cheng (The Year of the Book). Anna's a Chinese-American seventh grader in Cincinnati, one of only a few Asians in her school. She and a friend invite a young Chinese migrant worker from Beijing to visit for a year, but cultural and class differences make adjustment difficult. Unusually thoughtful and sensitive for a book for young readers, the story addresses cross-cultural differences and issues of friendship. Young readers will relate to this well-written and meaningful story about the challenges of fitting in.

Open Road Summer,Sweet tale of love and friendship on the road to stardom.,"Troubled teen Reagan O'Neill is reeling from the latest result of a series of bad decisions and rebellions during the past few years. Her best friend, burgeoning country music superstar Lilah Montgomery -- known as Dee to those closest to her -- has her heart broken just as she's embarking on her first headlining U.S. tour. Reagan and Dee decide they need each other more than ever, and Reagan hits the road with the tour. Dee is dealing with the downside of her skyrocketing fame, including tabloid headlines and long periods away from her family. Reagan is working hard at making better decisions in the way she lives her life. She's also confronting a past that includes being abandoned by her mother and living with her alcoholic father in the aftermath. Romance is the last thing Reagan's looking for, but, when she finds it on the road, she needs to reconcile her past decisions with how to move forward and love again.
","OPEN ROAD SUMMER is an enjoyable read about friendship and romance. Reagan and Dee have a strong friendship. They both are going through some typical teen issues, such as testing limits and learning about love, but in an exponential way, which gives the story its excitement. Reagan's character development is good. She's created a tough shell as a way of dealing with her troubled upbringing, but she learns to trust her instincts and open up to other people. She doesn't lose her edge along the way, which is good because her attitude makes her a fun character. Dee's character could have been the one-dimensional Taylor Swift knockoff she seems to be at the outset, but author Emery Lord gives the reader Dee as a fully fleshed-out teen skyrocketing into stardom and struggling to hold on to the things she cares about most in her life.
The reader gets a good glimpse of the downside of stardom, especially in terms of tabloid scandals and record execs micromanaging  star's life. Even though the characters are well drawn, the plot itself is somewhat predictable, especially when the story deals with the girls' past and possible future romances.","Parents need to know that Open Road Summer is about a squeaky-clean teenage country music star, Lilah Montgomery, and her troubled best friend, Reagan O'Neill. When both girls get their hearts broken, Reagan decides to join Lilah on her first headlining tour. The two teens spend the summer on the road, traveling cross America, having fun, examining their friendship, fighting the tabloids, and figuring out love. Teens sneak out and drink a little. There's kissing and heavy make-out sessions, and there are references to past questionable behavior that include drinking and sex. Characters use some profanity, but sparingly, such as ""s--t"" ""and ""a--hole.""

"Junie B. Jones and Her Big Fat Mouth: Junie B. Jones, Book 3",Impulsive Junie faces Career Day -- early readers.,"Loud and impulsive kindergartner Junie B. Jones is usually highly opinionated, but when her teacher announces Career Day, she isn't sure what she wants to be when she grows up. She's pretty sure it will involve painting, keys, and saving people, but there's no job that includes all that. Or is there?
","The zany antics of spoiled young kids has been done many times, and often better. The Junie series (approaching 30 books at last count) is amusing to most 6-year-olds, which keeps early readers reading, and it's mostly harmless and silly fun. What makes it so much less effective as literature than many others series, though, is the failure to engage Junie as a real character. She behaves outrageously, which is the source of the humor, but the author never really lets us know why, which means the reader is usually laughing at her, rather than in sympathy with her.
Still, it serves its main purpose -- to give kids something easy and fun and repetitive on which to sharpen their reading skills -- well enough. And parents can look forward to the day when their children graduate to books with a little more meat.","Parents need to know that much of the humor comes from Junie's bad behavior. Young readers are supposed to laugh at it, not emulate it.

More Happy Than Not,"Gripping, thought-provoking tale of memory, sexual identity.","MORE HAPPY THAN NOT is young Bronx-born author Adam Silvera's debut novel. It's the story of Aaron Soto, a 16-year-old Nuyorican living in the Bronx projects in a near future where people can get memories suppressed by undergoing a revolutionary technique called the Leteo procedure. Aaron has issues: His father recently committed suicide and he himself attempted it; his family lives in a tiny one-bedroom apartment; and his circle of friends on the block isn't always very supportive. Still, Aaron's got his girlfriend Genevieve, a beautiful artist, by his side. When he meets Thomas, a sensitive guy from a neighboring project who shares his love of comic books, superheroes, and classic movies, Aaron slowly begins to question his own sexuality. He knows Genevieve is great, but he's drawn to Thomas in a way that makes him wonder if he's a ""dude liker,"" a dangerous thing to be in his 'hood.
","With its urban setting and diverse characters, More Happy Than Not is a rare and poignant look at how a struggling gay kid from the Bronx deals with pain, grief, and the heartbreak of love. Like his protagonist, Silvera, 25, is gay, Bronx-born, and Puerto Rican (not to mention having the same initials), so there's an authenticity to his prose that isn't always the case with books about low-income, urban characters. Aaron is realistically depicted as a bundle of contradictions: His mother is employed but barely makes a livable wage as a hospital social worker; his friends include petty criminals and aspiring artists, dropouts and ambitious students. The sadness stemming from his father's suicide and his own attempt permeates everything Aaron does. Even his romantic relationship is somewhat based on gratitude to the one girl who stuck by his side while everyone else (even his crew) distanced themselves.
Aaron's story shifts into high gear once he starts hanging out with Thomas, who's sensitive, articulate, smart, and loves Steven Spielberg movies, comic books, and all the pop culture-touchstones that make for a believably fast fanboy friendship. Thomas doesn't act tough or keep himself separate like Brendan, Fat Dave, Skinny Dave, and Me-Crazy (the guys Aaron has known all his life). While Genevieve is away at art camp, Aaron begins to think about Thomas so often he questions whether he's straight, bi, or gay. If he's really gay, Aaron wonders if the Leteo procedure would be a way to ""fix"" him. Silvera explores the way the true you always comes through, even when you want to suppress that part of yourself. His writing explores the humor and heartache, the sense of hopelessness that can surround a kid in Aaron's circumstances. More Happy Than Not, as the title implies, is about a fragile boy finding a way through the darkness and into the light, where everything isn't sunshine and light but where happiness seems possible no matter whom you love or who loves you back.","Parents need to know that More Happy Than Not is a science-fiction story set in the near future, where people can pay to have painful or traumatic memories suppressed. As in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the procedure can be used to block everything from the violent death of a loved one, an ugly breakup, or even same-sex attraction. The protagonist lives in the Bronx with a diverse group of characters, and frequently their conversations are peppered with strong language (""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" coarse words for body parts, ""a--hole,"" etc.) and references to sexual activity and experience (tales of various first times, illicit hookups straight and gay, and teen pregnancy as well as protection). Despite the heavy themes and serious plot points, author Adam Silvera's debut book conveys a hopeful message about happiness, acceptance, and love.

The Legendary Miss Lena Horne,"Solid intro to singer, movie star, civil rights activist.","THE LEGENDARY MISS LENA HORNE traces Horne's fascinating life and career, which began on the road with her mother, an aspiring performer herself. Beginning with a job as a dancer at Harlem's famous Cotton Club, the fair-skinned and beautiful Horne was plucked off the chorus line and quickly became a Broadway sensation, a hit singer, and a bona fide movie star, earning the first studio contract offer from a film studio for a black actress. She refused to take the stereotypical and demeaning roles of ""maids nd mammies"" typically reserved for women of color at the time. ""They didn't make me into a maid, but they didn't make me into anything else either,"" Horne said. Being light-skinned caused her problems, too: ""Lest Lena be mistaken on screen for white, Max Factor created makeup just to darken her skin. Then she lost roles to white actresses who wore her makeup to play light-skinned black women."" Though racism and the fears of moviegoers in the South made it difficult to reach the career heights of her white peers, she built a solid body of work and appeared in such classic black films as Cabin in the Sky and Stormy Weather. She was blacklisted during the Cold War, faced a backlash for her ethnic ambiguity, experienced the harsh realities of Jim Crow laws and persistent violence against people of color, and eventually became an active member of the civil rights movement. ""In this battle, Lena was not just a pretty face,"" Weatherford writes, ""But a foot soldier."" ","This picture book bio is a solid introduction to an important pioneer of black American culture who has long been overlooked in the pantheon of Hollywood's brightest stars. However, it's a bit flat and flavorless. Elizabeth Zunon's stylized, understated oil paint and cut-paper–collage illustrations only occasionally reflect Horne's true radiance, and cramming so many major events and concepts into a picture book ultimately diminishes the narrative, though that may not bother young kids.
Lena Horne is certainly an admirable and inspiring figure for children. The Legendary Miss Lena Horne may be most useful as a way to expose kids to some of Horne's wonderful recordings and onscreen performances. Back matter includes a bibliography and suggestions for further listening to Horne's recordings and viewing of her films. ","Parents need to know that The Legendary Miss Lena Horne is by ward-winning uthor Carole Boston Weatherford, who has also profiled civil rights heroes Harriet Tubman, Gordon Parks, and Fannie Lou Hamer. It tells the life story of one of the underappreciated stars of stage and screen, singer and actress Lena Horne, who overcame political and racial persecution to become an enduring American icon. Her career eventually took a back seat to her participation in the civil rights movement of the 1960s, including an ppearance at the famous March on Washington, though she continued to record, perform, and rack up accolades.

The Chaos,"Surrealism, folklore mix in unforgettable disaster fantasy.","Having been bullied at her previous school, Sojourner \""Scotch\"" Smith dreams of winning a dance competition and earning enough money to move out of her parents' house. But when she accompanies her older brother to an open mic night, she's caught up in the mayhem that ensues when a volcano erupts in Lake Ontario and the rules of physics seem to be upended across Toronto. With her brother missing in a hole in the floor and mysterious patches of tar-like secretions spreading across her own body, Scotch must make her way to safety across a city in which Sasquatches now walk the streets, mythical creatures fight to the death, and everyday objects can suddenly turn deadly.
","THE CHAOS is far from a run-of-the-mill ""plucky teen faces the apocalypse"" novel. Author Nalo Hopkinson spends a lot of pages building an intriguing and emotionally complex backstory for her protagonist, and when the surrealistic disaster occurs, Scotch is the anchor that holds the freewheeling narrative together. Some readers may find the plot a little too random, but those who can go with the flow of non-sequiturs mixed with folkloric archetypes will find The Chaos rewarding and unforgettable.","Parents need to know that The Chaos is a well-written and imaginative fantasy novel that mixes surrealistic situations with characters and themes from world folklore. Its protagonist, Scotch, is forthright in her attitude toward sex (and was bullied because of it at her previous school), but she does little more than flirt during the course of the novel. There's lots of profanity (especially ""s--t"" and ""f--k""), and many minor characters are injured during the mayhem that ensues. Characters are attacked by formerly inanimate objects, pedestrians are wounded in the wake of battling prehistoric beasts, and Scotch is pursued and attacked by an imaginary pet come to life. Although Scotch is threatened by a cannibalistic witch, there's little person-on-person violence.

The Curse of the Werepenguin,"Funny, absurd adventure is full of heart ... and penguins.","In THE CURSE OF THE WEREPENGUIN, orphan Bolt Wattle wants nothing more than to find his family. When he’s suddenly sent to a mysterious baron in a place he’s never heard of, Bolt gets his hopes up, sure he’s destined to find his parents in Brugaria. What he finds is Baron Chordata, a yelling tyrant who lives in a castle, looks like a 12-year-old boy, and bites Bolt and turns him into a half-penguin, half-boy. The only way to break the curse that would permanently turn him into a werepenguin is to work with the villagers and bandits, all of who hate and distrust Bolt.
","This funny adventure takes a predictable plot and turns it on its side, adds humor and absurdity, and lets the reader enjoy the fabulous results. The pacing of The Curse of the Werepenguin is excellent; fast, with moments when the narrator jumps in that let the reader take a breath and think about the plot. This could easily have been a formulaic story, but that goes out the window as soon as author Allan Woodrow brings in the whale cult led by a guy who wields a stale loaf of French bread as a weapon, the friendly/sinister fortune teller, and of course, the premise of werepenguins who do battle by the light of the moon. Everything ties together in the end, and there’s a wonderful focus on how important family is, no matter what form it takes.","Parents need to know that Allan Woodrow’s The Curse of the Werepenguin takes absurd hilarity to another level, and blends it with a fast-paced, engaging story that would be sad if it wasn’t so funny. This wacky tale is full of “wink-wink-nudge-nudge” moments for the reader while having all the trappings of a tragedy: an orphan looking for his parents, a mean child-baron in a castle, a village under siege, bandits who plunder in the forest, and more.

"The Guinevere Deception: Camelot Rising, Book 1",Arthur's fair maiden freshly reimagined as powerful witch.,"In THE GUINEVERE DECEPTION, Guinevere's marriage to Arthur begins as a lie. She's not even really Guinevere but Merlin's daughter taking the place of the deceased princess, told that she is to protect Arthur from dark magic. None of the knights who fetch her from the convent seem to notice her lack of refinement or her affinity with the natural world, except Merlin's nephew, Mordred, who finds her charming. Brangien, her lady's maid, is also fooled at first, despite all the times Guinevere sneaks out of the castle at night wearing Brangien's cloak. Even though magic was supposed to be banished from Camelot along with Merlin, she sees small signs lurking everywhere amid her queenly duties: a mysterious, masked knight who tries to get closer to Arthur; rocks imbued with magic near the palace; poisonous, rampaging creatures in the nearby woods; dead spiders outside the magical barriers she's placed on every palace entrance. She's not sure what's coming, just as she's not sure how Merlin thinks her magic can save Camelot.
","Though the plot meanders, this reimagining of Guinevere's role in Camelot still intrigues with dark magic, a forbidden romance, and mystery. Guinevere is an enigma even to herself. She doesn't know her old name, who her mother was, or how involved Merlin was in her life before. And she can't trace her extreme fear of water to a trauma from her nebulous past. This mystery doesn't always build smoothly in The Guinevere Deception, and neither does Guinevere's understanding of her role in Camelot and what she really wants it to be, but the story still draws the reader along as Guinevere learns what it takes to both be queen and protect Camelot.
Like the original legend, a love triangle ensues. But it doesn't include Lancelot this time -- the knight is a totally new surprise for readers we won't spoil here. Here's hoping more curious surprises are in store for the rest of the trilogy.","Parents need to know that The Guinevere Deception is the first book in the Camelot Rising trilogy by Kiersten White, author of the And I Darken trilogy, Illusions of Fate, and The Chaos of Stars. Readers who are not as familiar with Arthurian legend will learn a bit here about Camelot, Merlin, and the Knights of the Round Table. Guinevere is imagined as more of central figure here, not just a fair maiden but Merlin's magic-wielding daughter sent to protect Arthur. And, sure enough, the worst of the violence here comes from magically controlled animals and trees. Wolves and a boar attack, a spider bite is nearly fatal, and tree roots squeeze the life out of knights and horses. Arrows also kill a few bad guys and a kidnapping includes a rough interrogation with the threat of death. Expect some straight kissing and innuendo and talk of an LGBTQ relationship. Guinevere (16) and Arthur (18) both drink wine, and other knights and villagers overindulge in celebration. Language includes ""s--t,"" ""ass,"" and ""damn."" While Guinevere still hasn't discovered her true strength by the end of The Guinevere Deception, she's brave and determined, and her husband, Arthur, sacrifices much to rule Camelot and protect his people.

And while it is illegal to perform curse work in the states, he begins to suspect he's been worked: His brothers have led him to believe that he has killed his childhood friend and longtime love, Lila. Although he has no recollection of doing so, Cassel vividly remembers standing over her body, knife in hand and covered in blood. Later, he wakes to find himself hanging on the edge of a roof in his underwear after dreaming of chasing a white cat. When Cassel is suspended from school for psychological instability, he decides to unravel the mystery of the white cat that's been following him. He must retrace his steps to figure out who he can really trust and to satisfy his unanswered questions about what really happened to Lila.
","This wonderful mystery writer with a wild imagination offers a compelling story of love, betrayal, and trust. Readers will feel both anxiety and empathy for characters who are taken advantage of. Although her novel starts slowly, it accelerates toward the book's conclusion with unexpected surprises. There is a lot of plot to follow here, and the narrator's memory loss makes following the story even more challenging. But teens willing to do a close reading will be rewarded.

Book includes a paper doll and blank doll pieces to help a young reader create a doll of his or her own design.
","In Fanny, the doll Annabelle's creator, Holly Hobbie has created a main character that is cute as a button -- a spunky, creative, imaginative button, that is. With the glamorous Connie dolls dressed as nurses, teetering in their heels, tittering through their puffed-up lipsticked lips, the homemade Annabelle doll happily, and busily, doctors stuffed animal after stuffed animal. While this scene plays on a bad nurse stereotype, so do the Connie dolls and so many like them that real girls encounter. And it's quite funny when these dolls are put in their place.

Fanny is the kind of kid that would be hard to say ""no"" to. But when it comes to the Connie doll, Fanny's mother does remain firm and consistent, causing Fanny to find a creative and wonderful solution that reveals this girl's remarkable character and teaches a great lesson in the process.

She wants to participate in the school musical, date, and make friends, but she doesn’t feel like she's worthy of anything good anymore and wonders who could ever want to be around someone with her physical and emotional scars. As she comes out of her self-imposed protective shell, she risks getting hurt but gains empathy for the people around her. The story shows the lasting impact of traumatic events and how most people are dealing with scars of their own, whether or not they're visible.
","A teen disfigured in a fire copes with devastating loss and the difficulty of finding her new normal in this inspiring and engaging story. High school is hard enough without facing it dramatically scarred, but in Scars Like Wings, Ava Lee has to do just that. Navigating a new school with severe burns is the ultimate test of her will and confidence. By putting Ava in that position, author Erin Stewart heightens the stakes in the typical teen issues high schoolers face, such as cliques, self-esteem, friendships, and dating, but there’s enough humor in the story to lighten the heaviness of the topic.
Ava's story and her friendship with Piper provide great insight into the different ways people deal with trauma. Ava shuts the world out, saying that she's giving her old friends a pass on having to deal with her, but in reality she's closing herself off to prevent any further hurt. Piper is loud and brash, but she's more shut down emotionally than she cares to admit. The story shows that pushing everyone away isn't the answer, nor is putting on a brave face and pretending all is OK. The balance between protecting your feelings and reaching out for help is important. As Ava works through group therapy, she writes poetry that breaks up the narrative and gives the reader insight into her emotional healing journey. The social drama at her high school is a cliché at times and some of the other students are stereotypes, but that part of the plot offers a look at the complicated emotions of people trying to figure how to support and deal with survivors. In general, Stewart does a good job of showing how one person's life-changing trauma has a ripple effect and can change the lives of those around them.","Parents need to know that Scars Like Wings is a novel about a teen girl, Ava, learning to navigate life after being severely disfigured and injured in a house fire that killed her family. A year after the fire and lots of surgeries and medical treatments, Ava reluctantly agrees to move from homeschooling to attending high school again. She chooses to start a new school, rather than face everyone who knew her before the fire. Regular teen issues like cliques, social awkwardness, and navigating friendships and romance feature in the plot but are heightened due to Ava's disfigurement and emotional trauma. There are descriptions of painful, disfiguring burns, grafts, and surgeries and ongoing pain after, verbal in-person bulling and cyberbullying of disfigured and injured teens. One character deals with homophobic slurs. A fight breaks out at a party with some shoving and a few punches thrown. There's little strong language (""damned,"" ""hell,"" ""crap,"" ""ass,"" ""pissed"") and substance use (a parent regularly drinks too much,  teen's drug OD is portrayed as a cry for help). And the sexy stuff is limited to a memory of kissing, some jokes about sex, and teen crushes. Ava's and her friend Piper's injuries and PTSD offer discussion points around the amount of work it takes to deal with trauma and the ripple effect an accident or disaster can have on people around the survivors.

Not Exactly a Love Story,"An obscene call sparks an offbeat, heartfelt teen romance.","Life gets bumpy for Vinnie just after he turns 15, in 1977. The girl he likes moves away, his parents split up, he suffers an awful acne outbreak, he gets mugged, and his mom starts dating his gym teacher, who's flunking him. He and his mom move from Queens to Long Island, and things start to look up: The girl next door is adorable, and Vinnie wants to get to know her. He comes by her private number, musters the courage to call her late one night, and blurts out an obscenity. The next night he calls to apologize, and then he keeps calling at midnight, anonymously, imagining himself transformed into the mysterious Vincenzo. They reveal more of themselves during these midnight calls even as Vinnie starts to get to know Patsy in real life. But she's smitten with her midnight caller, leaving Vinnie searching for a way to slip out of his web of lies and fully realize the genuine relationship they've nurtured.
","Audrey Couloumbis deftly explores themes of honesty, trust, and authenticity by setting up her protagonists in a tricky game based on deceit. Cloaked in darkness and anonymity, Vinnie is able to tease out the authentic side of a girl who's practiced at playing a role. It's an awkward role for him, and throughout he's a winning character.  By setting the story in the 1970s, Couloumbis neatly sidesteps the minefield posed by modern communication, which is a shame. Raised in an age of texting and Facebook, her readers probably won't fully grasp the stakes and allure of the midnight phone calls the way their parents might. And for all the soul-searching and longing for connection, some of the seamier notes -- such as Patsy's clear pleasure in receiving ""obscene calls"" -- are disconcerting (though realistic). ","Parents need to know that Audrey Couloumbis' Not Exactly a Love Story contains some sexual innuendo and charged repartee between a teen boy and girl. The novel explores authenticity in relationships, self-identity, and how we present ourselves to others, but these themes are propelled by Vinnie's nightly anonymous calls to Patsy, who seems sometimes put off and sometimes intrigued by what some readers might regard as stalker behavior. There's little to be concerned about, but the subtext of the relationship might give some parents pause. Parents might want to use this as a springboard to talk about privacy and conduct in a high-tech world.

Ringer,"Two fast-paced, exciting clone thrillers in one book.","RINGER is two sci-fi action books in one, each titled after its main character, ""Gemma"" and ""Lyra."" As with its predecessor Replica, readers can choose to read each story separately or alternate chapters between the stories. In Gemma's story, she's grappling with her life now that she knows more about the Haven Institute, its clones, and how everything ties in to her past. She can't shake the trauma of being hunted and seeing people die, nor does she feel like she can trust her parents anymore. When she learns that agents are rounding up clones who escaped Haven, she takes off with her boyfriend, Pete, to warn her friends Lyra and Caleum. In a case of mistaken identity, Gemma and Pete are thought to be clones and are hauled off to an isolated detention center housing hundreds of clones. They have no idea what fate awaits them and whether they can trust their only ally on the inside, a sometimes scary clone named Calliope. While Gemma and Pete are trying to survive in detention, Lyra realizes she's in danger and needs to hit the road. She tries to track down Caleum and a doctor from Haven who she hopes can help with her worsening health problems. Lyra's story centers not only on her physical journey but also on figuring out what it means to be human, how to decipher people's actions, and how to love and trust. Having been raised in an institutional setting with clones and researchers, the world is a large and confusing place for her. As both girls get closer to figuring out what is happening with the clones and the valuable research from Haven, the danger heightens and their lives are at risk.
","In these exciting stories of cloning and conspiracy, two girls on the run from danger end up plunging headlong into it. Ringer picks up where Replica left off. The first book explored secrets and conspiracy around cloning humans for research. Ringer deals with the clones' futures and what Haven scientists and government agents might be up to next. A large portion of the book has the teens dealing with dangerous situations, but it's most interesting when it explores their inner lives. After barely escaping when they learned the truth about the Haven Institute, neither Gemma nor Lyra can figure out where they belong in the world. Both feel lost and alone, but for different reasons. Gemma once felt like a normal teen, but she's now struggling to feel like she fits in, given her knowledge of her background and the terrible things she experienced in the first book. Having been raised in a research facility, Lyra is out in the world for the first time and trying to figure out how to be a human.
Ringer is an improvement on Replica in that the stories don't overlap as much, which spares the reader much of the duplication that bogged down the first book. Also, Lyra is a much more compelling character this time around. She learns how to read people, how to be a regular teen girl, how to navigate the world, and how to love. It's still too long for a story that could be told in a lot less space, especially when plot lines involving Gemma's dad and his cronies get short shrift. Exploring more of the players in the conspiracy would have added a lot of interest to the story.","Parents need to know that Ringer, a sequel to Replica by Lauren Oliver, is a sci-fi thriller about human cloning and government conspiracy. Like the first book, it's two separate stories in one volume, which can be read separately or as alternating chapters. In both stories, the main characters, Gemma and Lyra, are on the run -- away from people hunting them and toward answers to the mysteries around the surviving clones and ongoing research. The stories are heavy on suspense and action sequences, with many violent situations, such as shootings, a knifing, and inhumane treatment of clones. Gemma and Lyra each have a boyfriend, and romance figures in the plot. There are descriptions of making out, kissing, and exploring bodies. Swearing is infrequent but includes ""f--k"" and ""s--t."" Families will find good discussion topics around the ethics of cloning and medical research and the idea of what makes a person human.

No Truth Without Ruth: The Life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg,Meaty bio of RBG shows how she fought for women's rights.,"NO TRUTH WITHOUT RUTH: THE LIFE OF RUTH BADER GINSBURG begins with Ruth's mother who was discouraged as a child from excelling in school, and so became determined to support her daughter in her academics and ambitions. Though her mother died when Ruth was graduating high school, Ruth went on to college and law school, where she encountered discrimination as one of very few females in her classes. Because no law firm would employ her, she became a law professor, and also founded the Women's Rights Project, writing arguments and arguing cases in lower courts, and then in the Supreme Court. She was appointed to the United States Court of Appeals, and later to the Supreme Court, where she went on to argue landmark cases that significantly improved the way women are treated under the law.
","Ruth Bader Ginsburg is a popular subject of biographies for kids, and this book adds significant meaty detail about legal cases and law to the field. No Truth Without Ruth: The Life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg doesn't shy away from presenting legal issues and court cases to kids, and successfully simplifies them so they’re understandable and interesting. It underscores the point that Ginsburg's work and advocacy as a lawyer and judge have changed many laws that directly affect our lives; it’s because of her advocacy and fight for fairness that we have many of the legal rights we do today. It also makes the point that ensuring legal rights for women helps ensure them for men as well.
There are a few odd moments. On one page, Ruth ""could see her mom’s disappointment"" when she ""brought home a less-than-perfect report card,"" A- as shown in the art, and the mom's pictured turning away from Ruth in a pose that looks like maternal rejection. Another page proclaims, ""By 1980, Ruth was the single most important fighter for fairness  -- women's and men's -- in American history,"" a statement that might have benefited by a bit more precision and clarity -- legal fighter? But these are quibbles in the context of the overall bio, which is inspiring and meaty, clearly and precisely detailing legal cases, while celebrating the passion and determination of this fierce legal fighter who cares so deeply about equality and justice.","Parents need to know that No Truth Without Ruth: The Life of Ruth Bader Ginsburg by Kathleen Krull and illustrated by Nancy Zhang is a picture book biography of the Supreme Court justice that details her legislative accomplishments, particularly ones in which she fought for women's rights. The book details court cases in ways that make them accessible for young readers. Ginsburg, who grew up in an era when girls were actively discouraged from showing their smarts but excelled nonetheless, is a stellar role model for young girls today. The book also serves as an introduction to the Supreme Court, the U.S. Federal Court system, and the concept of law itself. A timeline, a flow chart of Federal Court system, and a list of 10 of Ginsburg's landmark cases are included at the end.

The Promise of Amazing,Quiet girl tangles with bad boy in light teen romance.,"The first time Wren meets Grayson in THE PROMISE OF AMAZING, he's choking on a cocktail frank and she saves his life. An obvious attraction develops between them, but quiet, good girl Wren isn't sure what to think when she finds out Grayson was kicked out of his elite private school for selling term papers. Still, he continues to pursue her, even getting a job with her family's wedding-reception business. Wren likes him, too, but as she learns bigger, more dangerous secrets about his past, she has trouble deciding whether to trust him.
","Some characters -- such as Wren's movie-obsessed friend -- are overly scripted, and the plot seems to go on too long before reaching a too-perfect ending. The protagonists narrate alternate chapters, so readers get to follow Wren and Grayson's inner thoughts and feelings as their attraction turns to love. They'll also know that Grayson has a bigger secret sure to cause some trouble down the road. Still, although this isn't a deep book, teen-romance fans may find The Promise of Amazing a pleasant distraction with plenty of drama to keep readers wondering how things will work out between these two. Swoon-worthy moments include Grayson's realization: ""I'd never felt like this before...it was like everything else in the room had faded to black. Except her. And me. And that was too important not to fight for."" ","Parents need to know that The Promise of Amazing, a romance between a reforming bad boy and a quiet girl, has some swearing, a couple of fistfights, underage drinking, and an instance of drunk driving. Mild sexual content doesn't go into detail about anything beyond kissing and making out. Grayson's poor choices in the past, from selling term papers to hooking up with girls so his friends could rob them (and having sex with two of his victims), are part of the story, but so are his efforts to change. Ultimately there's a strong message about mistakes being part of life and learning to let people move on and do better.

"""When Did You See Her Last?"": All the Wrong Questions, Book 2","More playful sequel, even as menace and mystery build.","The action picks up just where it left off in Who Could That Be at This Hour? Twelve-year-old Lemony Snicket is still in the strange, dilapidated town of Stain'd-by-the-Sea, staying at the Lost Arms with his ditzy chaperone, S. Theodora Markson. They're hired to solve a new case: find the missing Cleo Knight, a young chemist who's working on a secret project -- but for whom? Things get confusing fast as she's sighted in different places at the same time. Theodora's quick to call the case closed, but Snicket is always several steps ahead of her as well as the town's bumbling police officers. He's constantly gathering clues and connecting the dots, which all lead back to the same evil man behind the trouble in the first book: Hangfire.
","This sequel is just as clever, entertaining, and full of mystery and wordplay as the series starter, Who Could That Be at This Hour? But here Snicket and readers get to know the kooky Stain'd-by-the-Sea residents better, learn about some of their relationships (including two young sweethearts), and learn more about the town's history and old feuds. There's also more playful interplay between Snicket and the kids and adults he encounters. With wry wit, he constantly foils the bickering husband-and-wife police officers, outsmarts his chaperone, figures out the deeper mystery behind the many bizarre developments, and makes friends along the way.
Amid the laughs, twists, and turns, the tension and danger mount, leading to a dramatic conclusion that simultaneously satisfies and sets the stage for the continued pursuit of a major bad guy. Also, there's still much to learn about the trouble Snicket's sister is in back in the city -- a mystery that weighs on him throughout the book and about which readers get only a few hints. Stylized illustrations by Seth once again add intrigue.","Parents need to know that When Did You See Her Last? is the second book in the four-part All the Wrong Questions noir mystery series by Lemony Snicket, uthor of the 13-volume A Series of Unfortunate Events -- and alter ego of author Daniel Handler. This sequel is just as clever and suspenseful as Book 1, Who Could That Be at This Hour?, nd the 12-year-old Snicket is even funnier and more playful in his dealings with the kids and adults in the strange town of Stain'd-by-the Sea. There's more menace than actual violence, but a girl is imprisoned and chained up (readers only see the bruises from her shackles once she's free); a girl is stabbed in the arm with a knife (readers see her only after the injury is inflicted); a car crashes into a building; and it's mentioned that a man suffered terrible burns from an explosion years before.

Bunny Cakes,Baby Max struggles to write -- kids will relate.,"Max has not yet learned to talk, read, or write, so how can he convey his yearning for Red-Hot Marshmallow Squirters? Cleverly, he takes his cue from older sister Ruby, who proficiently uses signs and symbols to communicate. Max experiences the frustration of learning a difficult skill, but finds out that persistence and ingenuity make it possible to achieve new goals.
","Max exhibits an important stage of learning to read and write as he invents his own symbol to get his message across in this entertaining story. When children scribble a message and expect adults to be able to read it, they are demonstrating their understanding that people communicate through written symbols. With support from adults and meaningful opportunities to engage in pretend writing, they gradually begin to recognize traditional symbols, such as the letters of the alphabet.
Ruby and Max's use of written symbols is integral to the story line and a focal point of the illustrations. Writing is further emphasized by close-up insets of the yellow-lined paper and the written messages of both characters.

She'd hoped her mother might be distracted by the upcoming arrival of the first child of her brother Amir and his Chinese husband, but that's not happening. Happily, things at Beverly Hills High School are going better for Daria. She's found a small group of diverse friends -- Kurt (white American), Joy (Nigerian-American), and Caroline (gay) -- who call themselves ""The Authentics"" and support one another in their determination to be their true selves rather than someone others expect them to be. While researching a school assignment on family history, she takes a DNA test and is shocked to discover that instead of being 100 percent Middle Eastern, she's half-Mexican. Some snooping in the family lawyer's office uncovers an adoption contract and her birth mother's name. It's not long before she tracks down her address and is met at the door by her birth mother's stepson, a cute tattooed artist named Rico. Now things get really complicated, as Daria confronts her parents, meets her birth mother, has a date with Rico, becomes an aunt, and has to make some hard decisions about her true identity.
","This smart, funny, and heartwarming story of an Iranian-American teen's search for her true identity shatters many stereotypes about Muslim teens and families. Daria's world in The Authentics is overflowing with friends and family who come from diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds, and with a few exceptions, they all get along.

"Leroy Ninker Saddles Up: Tales from Deckawoo Drive, Volume One",Silly cowboy adventure perfect for new chapter-book readers.,"Inspired by the Western movies he loves, Leroy Ninker buys Maybelline the horse. Though Maybelline is old and has only four teeth and Leroy has never ridden a horse in his life, it's mutual love at first sight.

But when Leroy forgets that Maybelline hates being alone, disaster strikes: She runs away! In the middle of a horrible thunderstorm, Leroy must search high and low for his beloved horse.
","LEROY NINKER SADDLES UP features the same delightfully silly but sweet flavor as that in author Kate DiCamillo's Mercy Watson series, which takes place in the same town.

"How to Train Your Dragon: The Heroic Misadventures of Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, Book 1",Engaging story is great for reluctant readers.,"Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III is the son of Stoick the Vast, chief of the old Viking Tribe of the Hairy Hooligans. Hiccup, though reasonably stoic, is not very vast. Nevertheless he, like the other boys his age, must pass the tribal initiation test: capture and train a dragon for use in hunting. The dragon that Hiccup manages to snag, though, is tiny and not very trainable, even though Hiccup has the unusual skill of talking Dragonese. But when the tribe is beset by a mountain-size sea dragon, Hiccup's brains and his dragon's orneriness may be more useful than brawn.
","Middle-grade boys, especially reluctant readers, are going to love this. Author Cressida Cowell has taken a character from one of her picture books, Hiccup, the Viking Who Was Seasick, and wrapped a novel around him. It's filled with humor both broad (characters have names such as Gobber the Belch and Snotface Snotlout) and snarky, with crude but amusing illustrations by the author.
	Of course, humor of this sort is shooting fish in a barrel: All it really takes to get 8-year-old boys snorting milk out their noses is to say ""poop"" or ""underpants."" Fortunately, author Cowell also offers an appealing protagonist and a story that, though predictable, is entertaining and often exciting in a format that's clever yet easy to read.","Parents need to know that Cressida Cowell's How to Train Your Dragon is the first in a 10-volume series about a gentle young Viking boy, Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, who must prove he can catch and train a dragon to pass a Viking initiation test. There's a bit of violence (a deer is torn to pieces, a dragon attacks a boy, a boy is swallowed by a dragon but survives, an army legion is eaten by a dragon, a dragon blows up) but no graphic descriptions. There's plenty of potty humor (farts, snot) -- the kind that 8-year-old boys find irresistible. This is a great choice for reluctant readers. The book is the first of a series, and it was adapted for the animated film How to Train Your Dragon, which inspired the sequel How to Train Your Dragon 2 nd the video game How to Train Your Dragon.

The Glory Field,Stunning saga of an African American family.,"This captivating saga of one black family takes readers on a journey from slavery to modern times. The book features teenagers from five generations, each undergoing a crisis that leads them to maturity. The collection of stories is compelling. Together they present a dynamic portrait of the progress of black people in the United States. A riveting, important book for all Americans.
In 1753, 10-year-old Muhammad is chained in the hold of a slave ship. In 1864 13-year-old Lizzie escapes from slavery. After the war the family receives the Glory Field as their own farm. In 1900, they struggle to pay their taxes, and 15-year-old Elijah earns the money by saving a blind white boy. In 1930, his 16-year old daughter, Luvenia, is fired from her job in Chicago but decides to start her own business.
Back in South Carolina in 1964, 16-year-old Tommy, who has a chance to become the first black to enroll in the local state college, loses the opportunity when he stages a demonstration for civil rights. In 1994, Luvenia gives money to Malcolm to attend the family reunion, but Malcolm has difficulty trying to travel with his crack-addicted cousin, Shep. In South Carolina, Malcolm helps bring in the last crop from the Glory Field and learns his family's history.
","THE GLORY FIELD weaves together five stories to tell the powerful tale of a strong family living on the land that their slave ancestors had worked and came to own. Each story keeps readers involved, from Lizzie's exciting escape from slavery and Elijah's battle against a storm to Malcolm's trip from New York to South Carolina with his drug-addicted cousin.
The book introduces a wide range of characters and attitudes. While many incidents of white prejudice occur, Walter Dean Myers also presents whites who want justice for their black neighbors. Readers discover the fates of later generations of teenage characters as the stories progress. Tommy dies in Vietnam, and Luvenia becomes a wealthy businesswoman. The strong, capable Lewis family endures with Malcolm as its future.","Parents need to know that this is a stunning portrait of the progress of black Americans, as courageous teenagers escape slavery and combat prejudice and, later, drug addiction.

The Hero and the Crown,"Teens love this mature, Newbery-winning fantasy.","Fighting dragons. Wielding a magic sword. Not proper behavior for a young princess.

Vivid descriptions of a fantastic world, along with a powerfully written main character, make this book a favorite for young-adult readers.
 ","Robin McKinley has given readers a surprisingly realistic female role model, one that will quickly capture their imagination and attention. She is by no means invincible -- she is an imperfect human being, and makes numerous mistakes, often putting herself in great danger. However, even in her darkest moments, Aerin remains true to herself and to her goals.
As a princess, Aerin-sol is generally expected to keep to her castle. She meets with a great deal of disapproval, from the king and from everyone else, when she teaches herself to slay dragons and embarks on a quest to save her city.","Parents need to know that the heroine defies convention to remain true to herself.

The Crossover,"Soaring, poignant, novel in verse hits all the right spots.","Josh and his twin brother, JB, are inseparable, on and off the court. With the support of their father, a famous basketball player, they're poised to have a great season, maybe even win the championship for their junior high. Then things start to change. JB starts to spend more time with girls than with Josh, their dad is hiding a health issue that could change all of their lives, and Josh begins to lose his way. One big mistake, and he's suspended from the team, estranged from his brother, and wondering how much time he has left with the brightest star in his world: his father.
","Wow -- Kwame Alexander's THE CROSSOVER is a fast-moving, poignant, rhythmic ride that will leave readers breathless and in tears. Written in verse that's at times boundless and at other times masterfully restrained, it could have been just another ode to urban life, the world of sports, and teenage basketball phenoms. Instead, readers realize within a few pages that they're in for much more. Alexander tells the stories that need to be told: intact families of people who care for one another more than they care for the game, strong role models who support their children's dreams, and the realities faced by a young person growing up in today's world. Readers will fall in love with the characters, feeling the ache of loneliness, the heavy weight of worry, and the joy of family fun. Parents will love the opportunities the book presents for positive, deep discussions, as well as its slyly hidden life lessons and basic good values.","Parents need to know that author and poet Kwame Alexander's ​The Crossover is a poignant novel in verse that mixes basketball, family, and coming-of-age themes and includes serious issues regarding adult health and a parent's life-threatening condition. It won the 2015 Newbery Medal nd a Coretta Scott King Book Honor, and may inspire a discussion about healthy lifestyle choices and the impact of those choices on people and their loved ones. There's mild name-calling when characters are in the throes of sports-related trash-talking, and sexual content is limited to middle-school crushes and a kiss. The novel offers a positive example of a loving, intact family with active, involved parents and uses adult characters to provide a guiding influence. There's an audiobook version narrated by Corey Allen.

"The Song of Glory and Ghost: Outlaws of Time, Book 2",Strong girl steps up in wild time-bending fantasy.,"Opening almost a year of time travel after the events of Book 1, THE SONG OF GLORY AND GHOST finds Sam Miracle, now 13, racked with guilt -- not for saving his sister Millie from a horrible death but because saving her allowed the evil Vulture, an Old West outlaw with supernatural powers, to escape, and he's been destroying past, present, and future worlds ever since. Now, along with Cindy and Speck, the two rattlesnakes embedded in his damaged arms, he's trying to find and stop the Vulture and undo the destruction -- which was impossible enough, and then time-shifting mentor Father Tiempo disappears. Trying to support Sam, his faithful sidekick Glory is on her own desperate quest to save their mentor before evil Aztec monsters kill him in infancy. Along the way, she learns about her own powers and cosmic destiny and gets help from the Angel of Death himself.
","With the wild cosmology, chaotic time-shifting, comic book sensibility, and character development of much-tried teen heroes, there's a lot happening in this imaginative installment. It's a lot to keep track of, with monsters, mythology, some really nasty villains, and death and destruction in numerous timelines. The Song of Glory and Ghost is  wild, exciting ride, especially for tween readers, who may feel much the same as Sam and Glory's new redheaded fangirl from postapocalyptic Seattle:
""What would you do if you were me, living on smoked fish and twenty-year-old enchilada sauce, and then two comic book characters show up? Even if you are bad, I'm still glad I jumped through that hole after you.""","Parents need to know that The Song of Glory and Ghost, the second book in best-selling author N.D. Wilson's Outlaws of Time series, features 13-year-old heroes with unusual time-bending powers and character traits that serve them well as they pursue a world-destroying villain and try to save their mentor from being murdered as an infant. Characters meet violent deaths, and there are scary monsters aplenty, including ancient, evil Aztec goddesses, Navajo skinwalkers, and other undead beings enslaved by the dark side. There are strong messages of responsibility, courage, perseverance, loyalty, and friendship. The wild narrative jumps crazily in time and space en route to an epic battle, throwing in a wild mishmash of worlds and genres from the Old West to postapocalyptic pirates. But Wilson makes it all work, wrapping up some storylines while setting up many to come in future installments.

"The Screaming Staircase: Lockwood & Co., Book 1","Exciting ghost-hunter series start  is very, very scary.","Right after Lucy gets a job as a ghost-hunting agent with Lockwood & Co., things start to go pretty wrong. She and her new boss, Anthony Lockwood, accidentally set fire to a client's house when they forget their protective iron chains and are forced to fight off a dangerous Type 2 Visitor with Greek Fire to save their lives. The owners want them to pay up, or else their three-person agency -- the only one in London run completely by teens -- will get shut down immediately. As Lockwood looks for a way to make some quick money, Lucy and her special talent for understanding ghosts' thoughts comes in handy. Before their client's house goes up in flames, she learns that it's the site of a murder unsolved for 50 years. Lockwood takes the story to the press and, bingo, a new, high-profile client comes knocking. He'll pay their debts, but only if they spend the night in the most haunted place imaginable, an ancient monastery famous for a certain Screaming Staircase.
","Get out your iron chains and metal filings and lavender and whatever other ghost wards you can think of before you open THE SCREAMING STAIRCASE: This is scary stuff! And great fun for kids who are really ready for it. (Not 8-year-olds -- geez, publishers. This is not Goosebumps. And that's definitely a compliment.) Rooms look like they're oozing blood, ghosts with curling toenails come at teens ready to give them the dreaded ""ghost-touch,"" and, yes, a staircase really screams in a super creepy old monastery. Let's all stay the night!
	Even without the scares all the other elements are there to make a fabulous mystery. Mainly the three teen ghost hunters; all very talented, especially Lucy, who narrates. And there's Lockwood, full of pride, smarts, cheeky remarks, and bravado, giving off a definite Sherlock Holmes vibe. You never know what's going to happen with the dreaded locket until the end, and they never even get to the source of the Problem: why is the world suddenly full of dangerous Visitors? Readers will have to throw on the iron chains and crack open the sequel to find out.","Parents need to know that the publisher's recommended age for Jonathan Stroud's The Screaming Staircase is 8-12, but this nearly 400-page ghost-hunting mystery feels like a better fit for kids just getting into young adult literature: 11 and up. And readers must like scary stuff, or forget them sleeping in their own room with the lights off for quite some time. The main young-teen characters in The Screaming Staircase are very resourceful, very brave ghost hunters (only kids have ""the Sight"") and inhabit a world where ghosts are nearly everywhere, putting people in danger every night (a ""ghost-touch"" is painful and can be fatal). There are some super-creepy descriptions involving skeletal remains and a ghost making it appear that blood's dripping all over the room. As it gets darker, the presence and malevolence of ghosts get stronger and one of the characters has a sense of how and why particular ghosts died (always violently). The teen ghost hunters are threatened by the living as well, encountering rapiers, fists, and gunfire. All other content is pretty mild, with language no stronger than ""hellish"" and ""screwy.""

The Wild Robot,Robot vs. wilderness in poignant survival tale.,"In THE WILD ROBOT, when a cargo ship goes down in a storm, a crate with a robot washes up on an island. Curious otters activate it, and ROZZUM unit 7134 comes to life and introduces herself: ""You may call me Roz."" Though the island isn't a welcoming habitat for a robot, Roz has been programmed to be curious, so she observes the animals to see how they survive and mimics them. At first, the animals think she's a monster and try to mobilize against her, but Roz wins them over by helping them. She also adopts an orphan gosling and builds a shelter to save her animal friends from a cruel winter. Will she be reclaimed by reconnaissance robots looking for her? ","""Shipwrecked robot"" is the clever twist in this wilderness-survival tale that delivers fun information about animal behavior along with lessons about friendship and a heart-tugging emotional punch. When Roz the robot has to learn to survive on an island, she observes the animals who live there and mimics their behavior. For the most part, the animals are characterized naturally, not anthropomorphized. But Brown takes some liberties -- for instance, the animals observe a ""Dawn Truce"" so they can meet each day as a community without threat of predators stalking prey. Roz encounters numerous obstacles -- the physical terrain, violent storms, the initial hostility of the animals, the loss of a foot, a very harsh winter -- but she's resourceful and overcomes all with grace. And because she's described as female, she can serve as a plucky role model.
The pace of the story is sometimes quiet and meditative, but the chapters are short and punchy, and Brown employs direct address -- ""Now, reader, what I haven't mentioned is … "" -- that draws kids in and lends the book a classic feel. The lesson that kindness and community trump fear and competition shines through.","Parents need to know that The Wild Robot by Peter Brown (Mr. Tiger Goes Wild) is a middle-grade novel about a shipwrecked robot who learns to survive by observing and befriending the animals native to her new island. Set in an indeterminate future when crates of robots are carted on cargo ships and climate change kicks up violent storms, the story mixes artificial intelligence with wilderness survival. Though Roz is a robot and doesn't have emotions, she's thoughtfully observant and programmed to be helpful and kind. With some possibly disturbing scenes with guns, dismemberment of robots, and death in the wild, the story's also filled with lessons about kindness and pluck. The chapters are short and punchy, and the book is dotted with Brown's appealing illustrations.

All Rise for the Honorable Perry T. Cook,"Warm, moving story of remarkable boy who calls prison home.","Eleven-year-old Perry T. Cook has grown up in Blue River Coed Correctional Facility. He's done nothing wrong, but his mother, Jessica, is serving time for manslaughter. When Mr. VanLeer, the new district attorney, learns of the unconventional arrangement, he takes Perry into his own home and interferes with Jessica's upcoming bid for parole. Perry desperately misses the only family he's ever known and feels ill at ease living ""outside,"" but he applies the lessons he learned in the prison to cope in this new household. As VanLeer tries to break Perry's ties to Blue River, Perry fights back by working on a project to share the Blue River residents' stories and show what his real home has meant to him.
","This memorable novel celebrates unconventional families and the resilience of the human spirit in turbulent times. Isolated in prison, the residents build a strong community in which Perry thrives. Thoughtful readers of ALL RISE FOR THE HONORABLE PERRY T. COOK will be challenged to reconsider their presumptions about integrity, justice, and happy families. Perry's family is certainly flawed, but it's given him reason to wrestle with questions of honesty, fairness, and responsibility and equipped him with the skills to weather adversity.
Author Leslie Conner has created a fully realized world with caring, well-intentioned adults and children who are necessarily wise beyond their years.","Parents need to know that All Rise for the Honorable Perry T. Cook, by Leslie Connor (Waiting for Normal), is a sympathetic portrayal of life inside a minimum-security prison. There's none of the prison drama typical in popular media -- no violence, no bitter rivalries, no sense of menace. It's an unconventional family of residents reconciling with their troubled pasts and striving for a better future, trying to rise up together. Several residents talk about why they're in prison, including for manslaughter, and most accept responsibility for what they've done. Perry, age 11, who was born and raised in the prison, is wonderfully resilient, doing his best to maintain his integrity and honor with his prison family without disrespecting his new foster family, headed by a man with a dubious claim to the moral high ground.

"Julian Rodriguez, Episode One: Trash Crisis on Earth","Fans of Wimpy Kid will enjoy this one, too.","Julian Rodriguez is a decorated first officer who is sent to Earth to live as an 8-year-old Earth juvenile. He has endured much on this pitiful planet -- state assessment tests and attacks by girls. After a particular bad day for Julian, the Maternal Unit delivers the ultimate blow: He has to dispose of a pile of stinking, festering remains, otherwise known as garbage. Will he sink to those depths, and if he does, will he recover?
","Alexander Stadler has written a cool, funny, and fast-paced story. It will especially appeal to reluctant readers and fans of other illustration-driven novels like the bestselling Diary of a Wimpy Kid series by Jeff Kinney. And like Kinney, Stadler does a great job appealing to basic kid feelings -- that school is torture and adults are out to thwart fun at every opportunity -- in a clever and entertaining way.
At some point in time, every kid has felt like they were from another planet and just here to observe the weird social interactions among humans. And how strange it is that the parents Julian is ""assigned"" to live with don't understand his need for a steady diet of TV and junk food? Readers will wonder if Julian really is an alien or if he just wishes he were. Either way, referring to his parents as Maternal and Paternal Units and expounding on the value of cartoons is sure to get a couple of loud guffaws. Added to the clever dialog and Julian's rants on favorite kid activities like teasing and standardized testing, are some pretty cool illustrations. The stilted style evokes feelings of ""otherworldliness"" and really make the book come alive.","Parents need to know that there's nothing questionable to worry about in this book. There is typical disagreement between parents' rules and expectations and what kids want.

But the kid narrator remembers that Mom always says to BE KIND and thus tries to make Tanisha feel better. All the kid can think of to say is, ""Purple is my favorite color,"" but that doesn't help. Tanisha runs into the hall, embarrassed. The kid wonders what could have helped and thinks, ""What does it mean to be kind anyway?"" The kid imagines various examples of giving, helping, reaching out to a new classmate, sticking up for someone, and so forth, in the school, in the community, across the country and the world. In the end, the kid paints Tanisha a picture of purple flowers in art class, which Tanisha takes home and puts up on her bedroom wall. ","What could have been a sentimental exercise is elevated to a meaningful exploration of kindness in this lovely picture book with Jen Hill's charming watercolor-and-ink illustrations. The little kid narrator of Be Kind not only offers examples of reaching out to others to make them feel good or feel better when they're down, but also acknowledges that it's not always easy. ""And sticking up for someone when other kids aren't kind is really hard. (And really scary.)""

Mummy Cat,Mummified pet searches for his queen in lively tomb tale.,"The mummified pet of an Egyptian queen comes to life in their shared tomb and looks for the queen he loved. As the cat passes the detailed murals, he recalls the happy life the two shared, playing on a boat on the Nile and napping together by a pool, until a scorpion stung and killed them and priests wrapped their lifeless bodies. Will the MUMMY CAT find ""the queen of his heart""?
","This highly original introduction to Egyptology offers an engaging fictional story told in lively rhyming text embedded in nonfiction detail. The murals on the walls, skillfully rendered in the style of Egyptian tomb art, illustrate the life the cat and his queen shared and show that the scorpion sting that killed them was not accidental. A four-page afterword describes the mummification process in some graphic detail nd offers information about the real Queen Hatshepsut, the importance of cats in ancient Egypt, and hieroglyphs.","Parents need to know that Marcus Ewert's Mummy Cat, cleverly illustrated by Lisa Brown, is a picture book for older kids interested in ancient cultures and ready to think about death and the afterlife.

The Grapes of Wrath,Gritty Steinbeck classic brings Great Depression to life.,"Tom Joad, paroled after killing a man in a fight, returns to the family homestead in Oklahoma only to find his family gone, forced out as the banks seized failing farms. He and Casy, a former preacher, catch up with and join the family fleeing West to California, lured by tales of good work for good wages. At the center of the story is Ma Joad, surrounded by Pa Joad, his parents, six children, and one future in-law. Money and options are in short supply, but the family gets by with help from strangers. Their arrival in California is bitter: Fruit is left to rot as workers compete for low pay. The surviving Joads scrabble for food, shelter, and work. Even when they have nothing, they still find something to give to a starving man.
","This visceral novel succeeds as a gripping story and a piece of history. John Steinbeck, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962, alternates chapters following the Joads’ saga with poetic interludes detailing the larger forces at work against the migrants.   Steinbeck, who visited migrant camps to research the book, skillfully illustrates the widening gulf between the haves and have-nots. His sympathies are obviously with the desperate families (to the point where he was accused of communist sympathies), but he treats the comfortable classes with empathy: Lack of knowledge and understanding reinforces suspicion and hatred of the migrants, who for their part can’t understand why they’re so vilified. It’s an important lesson on perspective, and a fantastic starting point for discussing political, economic, and social issues still very relevant today.
	 ","Parents need to know that this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel about sharecroppers struggling to survive the Great Depression, fleeing the Dust Bowl in Oaklahoma for California, is as harsh and gritty as its time. There’s drinking, smoking, swearing, and extramarital sex, and violence stalks the Joad family and their fellow migrants. But its realism and passion have made it a must-read for generations. Families may want to follow up the book with a viewing of the well-regarded 1940 film version.

","With loose, funny, expressive art that captures the main character's many moods and enthusiastic outlook, this autobiographical coming-of-age story has lots of heart and plenty of universal appeal. Ozge Samanci's DARE TO DISAPPOINT: GROWING UP IN TURKEY meticulously depicts a specific time and place, but it will speak to anyone who marches to the beat of a different drummer.

He invents a machine that turns children into obedient, eager workers, trying it out first on Yesterday Harold and Yesterday George (duplicates from an earlier time-travel experiment). Present-day Harold and George are horrified to see themselves and their classmates transformed by something called Attention Superfluous Lethargy Syndrome into mindlessly obedient workers. As the only children unaffected by the noxious spray, thanks to their stuffy noses Harold and George travel to the future to get help from the only adults they can trust: their future selves.
","This 12th giddy book in Dav Pilkey's much-loved (and much-challenged) series is surprisingly heartfelt. We learn that George and Harold, who exasperate their teachers, worry their parents, and are far from model students, grow up to be successful, happy fathers and husbands. Pilkey takes a few jabs at the ""grouchy old people"" who've criticized his books. He then leads young readers on a merry mockery of grown-ups who seem to forget that being silly and creative is part of being a kid nd part of what will help them become good grown-ups someday. The story builds on twists and turns across the previous 11 books, but newcomers will have no trouble reading this as a standalone book. Pilkey hints this could be the end of Captain Underpants.

They do get into mischief at school but also buckle down and do their schoolwork. Some of the humor will sail over kids' heads (including pop culture-inspired chapter titles, such as ""The Trouble with Zizzles"" and ""Laughter Moon Delight"").

Parents get gentler treatment: When the boys overhear their parents gushing about their seemingly improved behavior, the boys react sadly and feel unloved.

Whether Natasha's wishes will come true remains to be seen, but there are deeper family mysteries to be solved in this series start. ","This emotionally charged fantasy could have used more magic, but the fact that girls are the ones who can be given magic makes it a positive story for and about girls. And there's a mystery beneath the magic that will surely be explored in the other books in the series. But some readers might get discouraged by the lack of the shivery coincidence that makes magic feel real or the shimmery gloss of stepping into another world. And it lacks the storyteller's grace -- and the deep friendships and rivalry -- that, for example, the Harry Potter series radiates. Instead, Natasha reports being pulled ""completely away from the real world by a memory."" And platitudes sprinkled throughout the story serve to distract, such as when Natasha says to a love interest, ""It's hard to know what you really want sometimes, you know what I mean?"" An interesting character, the Bird Lady, appears and disappears, intrigues and confuses Natasha. But she delivers an important message when she states that ""it's the girls who are full of magic."" Hopefully the second book in the series will get down to the business of magic nd deliver by giving the Blok sisters something really enchanting to hold onto. ","Parents need to know that Wishing Day is a middle-grade novel by Lauren Myracle (author of Upside Down Magic and the teen-targeted Internet Girls series) bout a family of sisters who are handed a tradition of magic that they might or might not believe in. Though there's nothing edgy or scary about this series start, the sisters are dealing with the mysterious disappearance of their mother and some otherworldly occurrences. Tweenage crushes and sibling rivalry take center stage more than the magic. And an obsession with beauty that's woven into the sibling rivalry scratches t Natasha's self-worth. Kids who are hoping to be swept away by a fantasy story might be disappointed to find that there's more family lore here than a magical journey.

Don't Let Them Disappear: 12 Endangered Species Across the Globe,Loads of lively animal info and a call to action for kids.,"DON'T LET THEM DISAPPEAR: 12 ENDANGERED SPECIES ACROSS THE GLOBE profiles each animal species, including giraffes, tigers, polar bears, giant pandas, sea otters, blue whales, whale sharks, lions, rhinoceroses, gorillas, orangutans, and elephants. Each spread describes the animal and what it eats, where it lives, its endangered status (vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered), and why it's endangered or vulnerable (causes such as habitat loss, climate change, poaching, pollution). Back matter includes more explanation of why they're endangered, a list of ""What You Can Do"" to help protect them, and a list of special days honoring 11 of the animals profiled as well as May 18, Endangered Species Day.
","This information-packed, beautifully illustrated picture book is both a celebration of the uniqueness of familiar nimals and a call to help protect them to avoid extinction. Don't Let Them Disappear: 12 Endangered Species Across the Globe is written in a lively, engaging style nd illustrated with charming watercolor portraits of animals in their habitats with subtly emotional touches, like seeing a tiger cub nuzzle a tiger parent's nose or two young elephants locking trunks. Each description of the animal species ends with the phrase: ""Don't let them disappear!"" -- driving home the point that we must keep these animals in our world and not let them die off due to inaction on things we have the power to change, like keeping land and water free of pollution, stopping poachers, ddressing climate change. Author Chelsea Clinton's passionate call to action mostly maintains  tone that's encouraging and hopeful rather than preachy. But in the ""What You Can Do"" section, she sounds pushy when she urges: “Tell your family they shouldn’t buy jewelry, trophies or anything else made from endangered animals.”
The sophisticated vocabulary and level of scientific information make it best for elementary school kids, but the fun facts and accessible art will appeal to preschoolers.","Parents need to know that Chelsea Clinton's Don't Let Them Disappear: 12 Endangered Species Across the Globe is a nonfiction picture book that teaches kids about endangered animals -- where the live, why they're endangered, and what kids and families can do to help.

Missy Piggle-Wiggle and the Whatever Cure,Reboot of classic series preserves original's charm.,"In MISSY PIGGLE-WIGGLE AND THE WHATEVER CURE, Missy Piggle-Wiggle is summoned by her great-aunt, Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle, to tend the house and pets while the aunt goes in search of her pirate husband. Missy, who's magic, unlocks a cabinet of potions she made when she was growing up and puts them to use helping the neighborhood kids with their behavior. She comes up with ""cures"" for mild behavior problems such as being tardy, saying ""Whatever,"" and smacking gum. The cures are offbeat. The tardy girl gets a watch with a deafening alarm, and the gum smacker gets a gumball that tastes like a dirty sponge. Before the story's over, Missy even helps some workaholic parents check their own dysfunctional behavior.
","Readers are in excellent hands with this redo of a classic series that updates the books for a new generation while preserving the charm, humor, and warmth of the originals. Missy Piggle-Wiggle and the Whatever Cure uthor Ann M. Martin brings to the project her expertise with series (The Baby-Sitters Club) as well as a deft literary touch. The new book's magical, full of the sort of potions that will excite Harry Potter readers, and it's told in prose so charming and inviting that kids won't care that the stories make fun of their annoying behaviors. The very silly names like Beaufort Crumpet and Edison Tickle clue readers in they're meant to laugh at themselves.
There's also a sweet bit of romance. When the touchingly awkward bookstore owner, Harold Spectacle, meets Missy, ""A shower of sparks glittered briefly in the air and sputtered out."" Readers may feel the same magic sparks when introduced to Missy and this delightful new addition to the series.","Parents need to know that Missy Piggle-Wiggle and the Whatever Cure, by Ann M.

Since Missy sometimes uses potions and pills, parents might have a conversation with their kids about not relying on pills to correct problems or accepting drugs from others. The new book's author, Martin, brings just the right magical touch, in conjunction with MacDonald's great-granddaughter Annie Parnell. Captivating illustrations by Ben Hatke (Zita the Spacegirl) introduce readers to the quirky, wild-haired Missy.

"City Dog, Country Frog",Touching tale of dog-frog friendship depicts cycle of life.,"City Dog meets Country Frog one day, and though neither is the friend the other was looking for, they realize they have a lot to teach each other. As the seasons pass, each animal offers his own tricks and games for outdoor play -- splashing in the spring, sniffing in the summer, and reflecting on the past during the cozy fall. Come winter, things have changed, and Frog is gone. Dog is heartbroken, but soon enough, spring returns, and with it the opportunity for new friendship.
","With its minimalist style and simple, emotional watercolor illustrations, CITY DOG, COUNTRY FROG is deceptively multilayered. A powerful tale of friendship, it doubles as a meditation on the lessons we teach each other, and the influence we have on others, often when we least expect it. But beyond a story of unlikely friendship, there's a heartfelt depiction of the changing seasons and the natural cycle of life: Everything grows old and eventually passes on, bringing a time for reflection and remembrance and a chance of renewal. Kids will love this simple story of the seasons that packs an emotional punch. Parents looking for ways to address the bigger questions of what our relationships mean, and how to manage grief, will find a simple but striking place to start here.","Parents need to know that City Dog, Country Frog is an understated tale about the cycle of life -- in nature and among all living things. It depicts the loss of a friend, and conveys sadness at that loss.

When her chemistry teacher won't let her doodle in the notebook where she jots down ideas for writing songs -- her passion -- she writes the lyrics to her favorite song on the desk. Someone continues the lyrics to the obscure song, and soon they're writing full-on letters to each other. Lily falls for this person who shares her taste in music, ""balances"" her, and gets her sense of humor, but she's afraid she could never be the cool, confident girl she appears to be on the page.

She has a loving family, and she puts her family, friends, and songwriting passion before guys. And even though her self-esteem wavers, she knows deep down that a guy she can't be herself around isn't the right guy for her. The resolution to the letter-writing mystery isn't a surprise, but it's not meant to be.

Goldilocks and the Three Dinosaurs: As Retold by Mo Willems,Silly dino twist on Goldilocks tale is roaring good fun.,"Goldilocks recklessly enters the home of the three dinosaurs, thinking it's the home of the three bears. She goes through two of the three stages of the traditional Goldilocks and the Three Bears fairy tale -- eating out of the residents' bowls (chocolate pudding instead of porridge) and sitting in their chairs (way too tall for bears) -- but realizes her mistake and escapes before trying out their beds.
","It's no surprise that Mo Willems has created another winning picture book, but this one's so funny and clever that it's an exceptional delight. It's ridiculous from the get-go, with not a baby dinosaur rounding out the family of three, as in the bear version, but ""some other Dinosaur who happened to be visiting from Norway."" The fun is in Willems' knowing twists on the traditional story, as when he notes that one day, ""for no particular reason, the three Dinosaurs ... cooked three bowls of delicious chocolate pudding at varying temperatures.""
The art is simple enough for toddlers to enjoy, with sly elements to entertain adults, like a painting of dinos dancing in a circle, modeled after Matisse's painting Dance, a doormat that reads ""Wipe Your Talons,"" and bowls marked ""P.D.""and ""M.D.,"" for Papa Dinosaur and Mama Dinosaur, and D.f.N."" for Dinosaur from Norway.","Parents need to know that Goldilocks and the Three Dinosaurs: As Retold by Mo Willems twists the traditional fairy tale in fresh and silly ways that should delight both kids and parents reading aloud. Some very young and/or sensitive kids may find the dinosaurs and their intentions a little bit alarming, but for kids who live dinos and fairy tales, the prolific author of Don't Let Pigeon Drive the Bus, Hooray for Amanda & Her Alligator!, and many other award-winning picture books has done it again.

The Girl the Sea Gave Back,"Sky in the Deep companion has rich detail, Viking violence.","In THE GIRL THE SEA GAVE BACK, Tova has read the runes for the Svell people since she washed up on their shore at the age of 6. The local holy man who found her and raised her thought she was a gift from the gods. With black tattoos all over her body, it's clear she's of the Kyrr people -- and with the eye tattoo at the center of her chest, she is lso a Truthtongue who can cast rune stones to read their fates. One night she's summoned to the Svell's council, where there are calls for war against the weakened Nadhir clan. The rune is clear to her: Hagalaz, or complete destruction. The chieftan Bekan is concerned and decides to forge peace to save his clan. His brother, Vigdis, has other ideas about what the rune means. He's already raided a Nadhir village and wants complete destruction for them at all costs, even if he has to betray his brother. Meanwhile, Halvard, the chieftan-in-waiting, sets out to meet the Svell people with other important clan members. When he spots Tova among the Svell, both sense an immediate connection -- something that ties their fates together. This feeling is interrupted when swords are drawn all around them and the killing starts.
","Though a much smaller story in scope than the author's last Viking-set fantasy, this companion novel still resonates, with thoughtful characters and a deep sense of place. Sky in the Deep brought two clans and two people together and explored prejudice and empathy. The Girl the Sea Gave Back gives readers a skirmish, a cry for war, and a big battle with far too many flashbacks in between. The goals are simply survival and peace. Secondary to that, Tova would like to know more about where she came from and what her real purpose is. Readers knows long before she does and may wonder why she doesn't escape from the Svell as soon as possible. When she makes the connection with Halvard, it's a long time before anything real can come of it.
While readers are waiting for Tova to come around, there's much to enjoy in The Girl the Sea Gave Back. The setting and the details of this world and the cultures that inhabit it will draw you in. The mystical Kyrr fascinate, even from afar. Author Adrienne Young pulls in close to the Viking-style beards and braids and armor -- and to the hearths where warriors stitch each other's wounds. Time slows in front of a funeral pyre as loved ones are laid to rest. The whole story may keep to a simple plot, but it hones in on its depths quite well.","Parents need to know that The Girl the Sea Gave Back is a Viking warrior fantasy from the same world as Sky in the Deep, but it takes place about 10 years later. A few of the same characters show up, but they have no major role to play, so either book can be read first. As in that novel, the battles and skirmishes are extra bloody here. Expect close-up details of gory action: throats slit with knives, the pop of a knife plunging into a chest, axes digging into flesh, etc. Many die, including a few secondary characters who are heavily mourned and burned on pyres. Many are also wounded, with details about blood loss, infections, and stitching deep cuts. A whole village of innocents is slaughtered, with details of the aftermath (seeing children dead in mothers' arms). A head is chopped off a corpse and carried away. Characters (including teens) drink mead and wine at meals and before and after battle. The main characters are admirable: Tova finally listens to her intuition and escapes her old life to right wrongs, and Halvard grows into the leader his people need in a crisis, one who ultimately chooses peace, even though it's harder to achieve.

The Leaving,Fast-paced thriller seeks to solve mystery of missing teen.,"Five teenagers return to their hometown 11 years after they mysteriously disappeared. They have no memory of who took them, where they’ve been, or even if they've been together during those years. Most unsettling, none of them has any memory of Matt, the sixth child presumed kidnapped with the five. They return to families changed and sometimes broken, and while some seem content to settle into their former lives and identities, two are determined to solve the mystery of their kidnapping. The story unfolds with one tantalizing clue after another -- the discovery of a cult novel whose plot mirrors their disappearance and captivity, notes suggesting Matt may still be alive, recovered memories that hint at a past romantic relationship between Lucas and Scarlett. And why did everyone dismiss a possible link between the disappearance and a school shooting?
","This abduction mystery relies on a fast-paced plot filled with twists and turns rather than the all-too-common storyline of teens being sexually abused by their kidnapper. Interwoven in the story is a provocative question: Who are we without our memories?
While the resolution of the mystery and identity of the kidnapper are believable, packing all this into a two-week time line is a stretch, although it's one not likely to bother readers caught up in the story. ","Parents need to know that Tara Altebrando's The Leaving is the story of six kindergartners who vanished without a trace, leaving no clues as to who might haven taken them. Eleven years later, five of them return home with no memory of where they’ve been or what happened to the sixth child who went missing that same day. As the five begin to recover fragments of memory, two of them set out to solve the mystery of their kidnapping. Taking place over the span of 15 days and narrated in alternating chapters by returnees Lucas and Scarlett and Avery, the sister of the missing child, it’s a fast-paced thriller, full of unexpected plot twists. There's some violence --  man is found murdered, a man falls down steps and dies, and there's a school shooting and references to the original kidnapping -- but none of these incidents is described in graphic detail. Sexual content is limited to  few kisses.

The Century for Young People,A must for serious and casual history students.,"This is history through the eyes of ordinary people who lived through extraordinary times. Premier journalist Peter Jennings has woven together top-notch reporting and compelling first-hand accounts to form an incomparable world history. A profusion of photographs helps bring to life the events that shaped this century. A must-read for both serious and casual history students.
","This treasure trove of information is distinguished by its blend of first-hand accounts and objective reporting. It is an excellent, high-quality reference book that offers a lot to look at and pays excellent attention to detail. Room should be made for this book in the student's home library.
While the text from its predecessor, The Century, has been adapted here for young people, the writing style has not. The prose is direct and intelligent; it's easy to imagine coauthor Peter Jennings reciting these passages on the nightly news. Younger readers accustomed to bold, clipped phrasing may at first find it hard to grab onto the elegantly formed phrases. Still, small touches throughout the book will make the people and subjects come alive for young readers, such as a list of tabloid nicknames for Babe Ruth and unvarnished quotes such as this gem from Charles Lindbergh on his fame: ""I was so filled up with this hero guff I was ready to shout murder.""","Parents need to know that this book focuses on many of the darker chapters in history, but many of these events can lead to stimulating conversations with children.

Allies,"Gripping, must-read novel follows young soldiers on D-Day.","ALLIES begins before dawn on June 6, 1944, as two American soldiers, 16-year-old Dee Carpenter (a German immigrant) and his best friend, 17-year-old Sid Jacobstein, are boarding one of the boats that will take them and thousands of other Allied soldiers to the beaches of Normandy. The invasion of German-occupied France is about to begin. In a plane flying above the English Channel, two Canadian paratroopers, 19-year-old James McKay and Samuel Tremblay, a Cree Indian from Quebec, await orders to jump into a sky already filled with enemy gunfire. At midday, with the battle still raging, a British tank driver, 19-year-old Private Bill Richards, and his crew head ashore from their transport boat only find they've been taken Omaha Beach instead of the beach where British troops had been ordered to land. On Omaha, a 20-year-old African American medic named Henry Allen, a member of the only African American unit on the beach, is treating the wounded, one of them the white officer who'd tormented him throughout boot camp. It's not just soldiers who have important work to do that day. An 11-year-old French Algerian girl named Samira Zidante must take a message to Resistance fighters after her mother is captured by the Germans. And 13-year-old Monique Marchand unexpectedly finds herself aiding the wounded men on the beach. As the day and the story unfold, some characters will briefly meet and team up to work together. Some will witness new friends' sudden and unexpected deaths. As D-Day comes to an end, there are joyful reunions and the knowledge that for those surviving, the fighting will go on.
","Fast-paced and intense, this is a war story that doesn't spare readers the harsh reality of what it's like to be caught up in a terrifying nonstop battle. But Allies isn't just about the battles fought on that June day, it's about friendship, loyalty, heroism, and fighting against prejudice. Its young characters (almost all in their teens) might well be like someone a reader knows. It's about average young people (as one says, he ""never did anything in his life to stand out"") caught up in an extraordinary moment in history.","Parents need to know that Alan Gratz's novel, Allies, takes place from dawn until after nightfall on June 6, 1944. This is D-Day, just as the invasion of France by Allied forces fighting against Nazi Germany is about to begin. The novel interweaves the stories of young soldiers (two American infantrymen, two paratroopers from Canada, an African American medic, and a member of a British tank crew) and two young French girls. The violence builds as the day unfolds and becomes constant, vividly recounted, and sometimes unexpected, as characters that readers have come to know are killed or wounded. Soldiers are blown up by underwater mines, ""obliterated"" by mortar shells, and cut down by machine guns. The Nazis force women and children into a church and set it on fire. Minorities in the novel are labeled with nicknames commonly used in the 1940s (""Yid,"" ""spade,"" ""coon,"" ""boy"") that the author makes clear are offensive. While the publisher recommends the book for kids 8-12, it's best for readers nature enough to deal with the harsh realities of war.

The Turtle of Oman,Poetic story about boy who doesn't want to move to America.,"Having always lived in Oman, Asef doesn't want to move to the United States with his parents for three years while they attend graduate school in Michigan. He's not getting very far in his packing, and is generally gloomy thinking about all the things he loves about Oman, and  how his cousins will be moving into his house and messing with his stuff. His beloved grandfather takes him on a series of adventures -- a trip to the beach, a camping trip to the desert, an overnight on his grandfather's roof -- giving Asef sweet memories and also the insight he needs to have a new attitude about his new adventure.
","THE TURTLE OF OMAN has a lyrical style and languid pace that will stick with readers. The story is both educational in its portrait of the Arabian country and its people (and all the facts Asef lists between the pages about turtles, foxes and more), and moving, as readers see the love Asef has for his home, and especially his grandfather, Sidi. Asef's playful, loving grandfather is well-drawn, and readers can't help but be envious of their endless stream-of-consciousness conversations (""Talking with Sidi felt like a sky of floating words. You could say anything. Words blended together like paint on paper when you brushed a streak of watercolor orange onto a page, blew on it and thin rivers of color spread out, touching the other colors to make a new one."")

Readers will learn something about Oman and its people and pick up on the the various facts Asef lists between the pages about turtles, foxes, and more.

The Boy Who Lost Fairyland,Changelings return to Fairyland in twist to dazzling series.,"As the story opens, Hawthorn, a troll infant dazzled by the blandishments of the Red Wind, is swept away from Fairyland and swapped for Thomas, the baby of a Chicago couple. This doesn't turn out so well, as his human parents can't deal with his wild enthusiasms and just want him to be ""normal."" But on his first day of school, he makes a friend, Tamburlaine, and over time they realize they're both changelings and have unexpected powers. Tamburlaine paints vivid pictures of a place she can barely remember, and one day the kids, accompanied by a suddenly alive stuffed patchwork wombat, a walking gramophone who can only converse in song lyrics, and the baseball the Red Wind had left with infant Thomas, walk through the wall into Fairyland. This is where, after many adventures and the occasional reappearance of characters from the earlier books, their story connects with that of September -- who, at the end of Book 3, was stuck in a very perilous situation.
","Kids who like their language simple and their universes orderly have probably long since bailed on the Fairyland series. In particular, they may have tired of uthor Catherynne M. Valente's fondness for wild images and pure delight in yanking the rug out from characters and readers alike at frequent intervals. But, although she's not going to be everyone's dish, Valente's narrator is that rare jewel: She has ll this under control and dispenses assorted reassuring asides but also doesn't take herself too seriously. Which is a big part of what makes you willing to cut Valente some slack when she launches the fourth book in a five-part series by introducing a protagonist you've never heard of, and she makes you care deeply about the plight and future of THE BOY WHO LOST FAIRYLAND. She dazzles you with language, cracks you up, and breaks your heart, often in the same paragraph, such as this one:
""Thomas Rood had a naked heart, even when the rest of him was bundled up in hats and mittens in the depths of winter. And it was this naked heart that hurled itself at everything, at lamps and toys and flagstones and draperies. Thomas could not help it. All his life he had known that something was wrong. It was only that he did not know what it was. He felt all the time as though there were another boy inside him, a bigger boy, a stronger boy, a boy who knew impossible things, a boy so wonderful he could talk to jewels and make friends with fire. But whenever he tried to let that boy out, he was only Thomas, red-faced, sputtering, gangly, clench-fist Thomas.""","Parents need to know that The Boy Who Lost Fairyland, the fourth book in Catherynne M. Valente's five-volume Fairyland series, throws readers a curve by devoting most of its pages to characters we've never seen before, including the one referred to in the title. Once again, the language is exuberantly lush, the characters intriguing and relatable, and the plot a never-ending series of unexpected developments. It's a natural for kids who love gorgeous words, sly historic and cultural references, and cosmic peril. Some violence is cartoonish (such as a character stabbing a monster), while there's some emotional abuse (for example, a changeling character's parents can't stand the fact that he's not ""normal""). Sex is not really on the radar of the 12-year-old (in human years) protagonists, although a few passing narrative remarks dance humorously around the issue. There's a bit of playful gender-bending, as some female characters have male names and vice versa.

"Steelheart: The Reckoners, Book 1",Teens stand up to supervillains in action-packed sci-fi.,"When 8-year-old David Charleston witnesses his father's death at the hands of the supreme supervillain known as Steelheart, the boy vows to get his revenge. A decade later, he sees his chance to join the \""Reckoners,\"" fellow humans working to depose Steelheart and the other superpowered \""Epics\"" who rule over Newcago. At first, the Reckoners aren't inclined to take him seriously, but David soon wins them over with his eye for strategy and his encyclopedic knowledge of the Epics' habits and vulnerabilities. But will that be enough to bring about the downfall of Steelheart and his minions?
","STEELHEART upends the usual superpowers setup, presenting a world in which the bad guys have already won and there seem to be no heroes willing to stand up to them. David and his fellow Reckoners devise elaborate plans to depose Steelheart and his minions; the action scenes are vivid and full of tantalizing twists. Author Brandon Sanderson's fantasy scenario has great potential: Although this book reaches a satisfying resolution, it's clear readers will have plenty more wrinkles to explore in forthcoming volumes. Fans of X-Men and Batman will rejoice.","Parents need to know that Steelheart is a fast-moving, action-packed, clever take on superheroics, set at a time after supervillains have taken over the world. The body count runs fairly high as David and the ""Reckoners"" use everything from handguns to explosives against their enemies. ""Damn"" and ""hell"" appear a few times each, but the characters mostly employ made-up curses: ""Calamity"" or ""Sparks,"" for example. David is attracted to and flirts awkwardly with buxom and beautiful Megan, but their relationship doesn't become physical.

Queen of Christmas,Christmas lesson about gifts and giving.,"To the Queen, Ann Estelle, Christmas is all about the \""List.\"" Each day she adds something new, hoping not to waste such a \""golden gift-getting opportunity.\"" But in the end, she realizes that her perfect day had included much more than just presents.
","The book's bright colors and happy faces make it seem warm, cheery, and harmless. And ultimately the lesson is that family, friends, food, singing, and stories are the important part of Christmas celebration. But the joy of making a gift list so long that it stretches from one Christmas to the next is unsettling. This might have been a better book if Ann Estelle had added a few things on her list for the other people in her life.
It's hard not to like Ann Estelle, even though she seems to only look out for her own wants and needs. Happily, she gets caught up in the joys of her holiday celebration -- ice skating, baking, caroling, decorating, and playing with her cousins -- and forgets about the list altogether.","Parents need to know that in Ann Estelle's mind, Christmas won't be perfect unless she gets the perfect gifts. This is presented as a cute, kid-thing to do -- part of the charming narcissism of childhood. She does change her mind in the end.

Golem,Giant legend too heady and scary for little ones.,"To combat the persecution of the Jews in Prague, the chief rabbi creates a powerful giant of clay (the Golem). The Golem looks on him as a father, and does all he can to help the Jews fight their enemies. End notes develop the legend further and tell the history of the persecution and repression of Jews.
","The multi-layered cut-paper illustrations of GOLEM are magnificent, and are a good enough reason to own this book. They're definitely the reason it won the Caldecott medal in 1997. The pages with the intricately cut clouds and mist are particularly impressive. Throughout, David Wisniewski has manipulated Color-Aid, coral, and bark paper to create this haunting adaptation of this somewhat scary and sad Jewish legend.
The story here has been simplified, which makes it more accessible to young readers. However, they may not be the appropriate audience. Readers should be old enough to learn about the persecution of the Jews, accept that a man (even the holiest of rabbis) could create a giant from clay, understand why the giant was heroic for his violent overthrow of the oppressors, and most importantly, get why the rabbi has to return the Golem to earth even as the monster pleads, like a child to his father, that he wants to live. Readers who are ready for this story might be better served by Isaac Bashevis Singer's longer, more complete, and richer version, also called The Golem.","Parents need to know that though this book won the Caldecott Medal in 1997, usually reserved for lighter picture books, it contains images that may frighten young children. Also, the story, which is an adaptation of a medieval legend, may unsettle them. It discusses the persecution of the Jews in Prague and shows the violent way the Golem dispatches enemies. More sophisticated readers will find the book more captivating and inspiring, though still somewhat distressing, especially when the Golem is destroyed.

I Am Otter,Adorable otter makes a mess in fun friendship story.,"Otter introduces herself to the reader and shows how her life is full of fun and imaginative play with her best friend, Teddy (a teddy bear), and Otter Keeper, the boy who got her when she was a baby and eventually grew into a man with a job. Otter misses him on the weekdays, so when Monday rolls around she tries to prevent him from going to work by throwing his alarm clock into the fish bowl and eating his lunch. But he still manages to go, and, while he's away, Otter comes up with activities and pretend games involving Teddy and the other toys. She makes a big mess when they open a toast restaurant for the stuffed animals, and, when Otter Keeper comes home, she tries to blame the mess on Teddy but discover's Teddy's missing. After a thorough search, she finds him, calm is restored, and Otter learns how important her friends are. Then she starts to blame things on another stuffed animal, Giraffe.
","I AM OTTER is a delightful story that mirrors imaginative childhood free play and childish self-centeredness in the adorable, irresistible Otter. British author Sam Garton developed the exuberant character on his popular website, I Am Otter, which led to the book. The classic look of Garton's colorful illustrations matches the classic approach to kid fun in which Otter engages. She speaks directly to the reader, so kids can easily connect with her. Kids will love her exuberant attitude -- she's always up for anything -- and creativity. She's never bored, because she can always make up a game to play or project to do with her stuffed-animal friends. And kids will enjoy being a bit more savvy than Otter and spotting how her schemes will backfire before she does. ","Parents need to know that Sam Garton's I Am Otter is a fun picture book inspired by his popular British website I Am Otter. The story is narrated by the self-entertaining Otter, who makes a mess creating a toast restaurant for her stuffed-animal friends while Otter Keeper (the man who has kept her as a pet since he was a boy) goes off to work. Otter is great at imaginative play with her best friend, Teddy (a teddy bear), and her other stuffed-animal friends. She tends to blame others for the trouble she causes (first Teddy, then Giraffe) but feels bad after she's been mean and learns how important her friends are. It's pure silly fun and a great reflection of childhood behavior, with wonderfully engaging illustrations and adorable Otter at the center of the action.

The King of Little Things,Imaginative tale of greedy king has positive messages.,"King Normous wants everything in the kingdom to bow to his power, and he raids all the villages until every last one is within his grasp. But when he finds out about the King of Little Things, who rules all the small things in the land, King Normous figures he's got this one in the bag -- or so he thinks. Along the way he will discover just how important the little stuff is. This is author Bil Lepp's first picture book, and it's illustrated magnificently by Daniel T. Wenzel, who previously illustrated the graphic novel version of The Hobbit.
","This is a clever, imaginative yarn that blends mythology and tall tales to impart an important lesson: Everything has value, and little things often have more power than we give them credit for. With vivid watercolor illustrations that evoke a mystical medieval past (and an almost Grimms'-lite feel), the story reads as larger than life, and the message really pops.
As such, kids who like fantasy and royalty will enjoy the old-fashioned style of this tale, though young kids might find King Normous' anger and bottomless thirst for power a tad frightening. Parents will appreciate the strong message here about generosity and humility.","Parents need to know that The King of Little Things depicts a greedy king on a quest for universal dominance. There's a bit of sneering anger that could frighten young kids, and some crudeness, such a crew of soldiers who are stricken with toe fungus, but overall the message is a positive one about valuing all things big and small (especially small).

When Myrtle and her baby brother go outside to play, Frances sings mean songs about them, ambushes them, and scares them so much they decide to just stay indoors. Their parents bring in the kids' spunky Aunt Tizzy, just back from a safari in Africa, who, with her stories of bravery and some African masks, helps Myrtle fell strong enough to stand up to Frances. Myrtle asks Aunt Tizzy if she was scared of the lions in Africa, and Tizzy says when they roared, \""I told them to stop being rude, and if they continued, I'd simply roar back. ... Or sometimes,\"" she adds, \""I would just sing and dance until they were gone.\"" Myrtle tries both strategies and finds they work.
","MYRTLE does an excellent job of tackling the bullying issue at a little kid's level. The art is irresistible, from the soft pastel tones of Myrtle's world to the bright African dress and masks of Aunt Tizzy. It' not always easy for kids to articulate their emotions, especially fear, but this story helps draw them out in Myrtle, and should do the same for readers.","Parents need to know that this cute picture books about a little girl rat and the rat bully who moves in next door deals with the issue of bullying in terms a little kid can understand and relate to.

"Get Mooned: Joey & Johnny, the Ninjas, Book 1",Giddily fun start to ninja series has lots of fighting.,"Best friends Joey and Johnny are students at Kick Foot Academy, a very traditional -- and dangerous! -- ninja school in Lemming Falls. Though they're devoted to becoming spectacular ninjas, they seem to cause chaos wherever they go. Nevertheless, their intimidating headmaster taps them to keep tabs on a suspicious exchange student, who turns out to be a superhero sidekick-in-training. On their mission, the boys discover that their rivals in Red Moon Clan have been arming themselves with mechanical suits and high-tech weaponry -- which is so not ninja. The two ninja schools must face each other in the traditional Test of Three to determine which school will survive -- and which will shut down for good.
","Joey and Johnny hurtle from one amped-up adventure to the next in a lively world filled with ninjas, superheroes, con men, and shadowy villains. The silliness is sometimes crammed to overflowing.
The plot of GET MOONED unspools loosely, with meandering asides on pop culture or the astral plane. There's hardly a line of dialogue or a descriptive sentence that doesn't aim for a chuckle. But most of those chuckles are well-earned with engaging wordplay and clever writing. Comics panels and spot illustrations add to the fun and help draw readers, even reluctant ones, in.","Parents need to know that Get Mooned: Joey & Johnny, the Ninjas, Book 1​ kicks off a funny, frenetically paced series. Spot illustrations and intermittent comic-strip sequences add to the appeal, especially for graphic novel fans. The violence -- and there's a lot of it -- is over-the-top ridiculous: daily battles with a venomous mountain-dwelling octopus, school lunch turned into a contact sport, a class focused on wielding and avoiding all things sharp and pointy. The octopus’ venom causes victims to behave similarly to someone under the influence of alcohol or drugs; they speak nonsense, appear to hallucinate, and ultimately pass out.

He doesn't really mean to leave them there for long, but his plans go awry, and soon the terrified but resourceful kids are imprisoned by toothy creatures and creepy adults in this strange academy -- not for long, if they can help it.
","Kids who have a hard time seeing the funny side of emotionally harrowing situations, from scary monsters to mourning and parental abandonment, might want to pass on this book. But readers steeped in Neil Gaiman and Lemony Snicket will find Witherwood Reform School a fast, entertaining read. Some will gripe that very little is resolved at the end of this volume, which is largely a setup for future installments.

"The Hunger Games, Book 1","Exciting, provocative tale of lethal reality show.","THE HUNGER GAMES is set In the future, after the United States is gone. In its place is Panem, in which the city of Capitol, somewhere in the Rockies, rules over 12 rebellious districts. To maintain an iron grip, the Capitol holds an annual televised reality show, a lethal form of Survivor to which each district must send one boy and one girl. Out of these 24 teens, only one will survive. Katniss, who volunteers to take her sister's place, and Peeta are District 12's competitors, but their competition is complicated by Peeta's announcement that he is in love with Katniss.
","For her first young-adult novel, Suzanne Collins has mixed together elements both classical and modern to produce a story that, if not entirely new, nevertheless bears her unique imprint. Beginning with elements of the Theseus myth, she mixes in a large dollop of Battle Royale by Koushun Takami, elements of Shirley Jackson's The Lottery, reality TV shows Survivor, American Gladiators, and Project Runway, and an extrapolation of current political and social trends. But she makes it her own, and The Hunger Games voids feeling derivative through her complex and poignant characterizations of both major and secondary characters, and the bewildering interplay of personal feelings and political machinations.
Collins does all this in the context of an all-out action-thriller told in straight-ahead yet subtle prose with a carefully calibrated level of edgy violence that never goes over the line. A story of teens massacring one another could, in the hands of a different author, have been sensationalistic and even sick but, by keeping the focus relentlessly on the personal, Collins makes it both moving and thought-provoking. This will be a terrific discussion starter for middle-school literature groups, in which students will quickly make fruitful connections to our own society. Her novel Gregor the Overlander series is brilliant. With this second series, Collins shows that she's  major voice in children's and young adult literature.","Parents need to know that Suzanne Collins' The Hunger Games is a story about a reality show where 24 teens must kill one another until only one survives. They do so with spears, rocks, arrows, knives, fire, and by hand. It's not unduly gory, but there is lots of violence, all of it teen on teen. The Hunger Games was adapted for a 2012 film, and the second book, Catching Fire, was adapted for a 2014 film.

Assuming her identity, Emma is soon living a life of luxury, but is being threatened by her twin's killer. Soon, she starts suspecting everyone in her twin's prank-playing clique, including Sutton's own younger sister.

","Parents need to know that this is the first book in a series written by the same author who penned Pretty Little Liars. Like that series, this one features a group of rich, popular, label-loving Mean Girls who backstab each other and pull pranks. At the heart of this book is the murder of a teen girl -- and her twin is in constant danger as she tries to solve the crime, suspecting Sutton's sister, friends, and more. Emma is a bit of an outsider, and is shocked by the girl's behavior, providing readers with a more relatable narrator than many of these kinds of books -- but the pranks are intense enough that the author includes a plea to her readers to ""please don't try any of these Lying Game pranks at home.""

Mammalabilia,Witty words with whimsical illustrations.,"Twenty-one extraordinary poems about twenty-one extraordinary creatures! Witty words are whimsically accompanied by childlike illustrations of original mammals: an oddly shaped tapir, a sneaker-wearing rhebok, a bactrian camel donning a dapper hat. The spiraling word format reinforces the energy of the language.
 ","Douglas Florian's paintings -- done on primed brown paper bags -- energize the mammals, and his words cleverly describe their idiosyncrasies. The hippo who ""eats and eats and eats and eats"" has a table and a place setting inside his mouth. With the text ""Madagascar leaping lemurs breeze through trees without breaking femurs,"" three gleeful primates fly off branches as crutches float around them.
For one 5-year-old reader, MAMMALIBILIA was a good introduction to animals he hadn't heard of before, and the silly verses encouraged him to remember some of the animals' characteristics, such as the lynx's sought-after coat and the tapir's hefty head. Florian presents wonderful examples of how cool words can be.","Parents need to know that there is nothing of concern in this book of humorous poems with inventive paintings.

Chrysanthemum,Cute story about the perils of an unusual name.,"Hooray! said Chrysanthemum. \""School!\"" Her joy is short-lived, however, as students tease her about her name. Reassured by her parents that she is loved and that her name is perfect, Chrysanthemum returns to school the next day, to more teasing. Engaging illustrations captivate young readers, who will be eager to know the outcome.
 ","Children will feel Chrysanthemum's despair, and her hope that each day will be better, and author Kevin Henkes takes care that the teasing students are won over, not put down. Parents and perceptive children will enjoy Henkes' wordplay. Her father is a walking thesaurus, sprinkling synonyms that follow her mother's adjectives: When her mother says, ""Your name is beautiful,"" he follows with, ""And precious and priceless and fascinating and winsome.""
Watercolor-and-ink illustrations capture Chrysanthemum's moods and the superior attitude of the other mice children at school. One page contains 16 portraits and the names of each of the students written in their individual handwriting. Another shows the worried father surreptitiously reading a book titled The Inner Mouse, Volume One: Childhood Anxiety.","Parents need to know that art and story mesh perfectly in this delightful tale, though the ending is a bit too coincidental.

Scary Stories for Young Foxes,"Intense, violent horror adventure is riveting and haunting.","In SCARY STORIES FOR YOUNG FOXES, fox kits Mia and Uly are separated from their litters and find themselves thrown into a dangerous world full of terrifying unknowns as they try to make their way home. Far from their dens, they have to navigate dense forests, open fields, river monsters, and homicidal humans, and other scary monsters that lurk in the dirt and snow. Beyond the environmental treachery, they have to face their own inner demons, the nagging self-doubt and emotional pain inflicted by their own families who might not even want them alive. The book is a collection of short stories told campfire-style to a dwindling number of fox kits, with each story blending into the next.
","Heavy, violent, and thought-provoking, this is the rare horror story that's also heartwarming. Scary Stories for Young Foxes takes readers on a terrifying ride, masterfully combining the feelings of inadequacy and fear that come from being rejected by family with the optimism and courage of young hearts. Uly's father's domination helps readers consider the complicated choices surrounding family violence, and his siblings' bullying because of his disability will hit sensitive readers hard.
Each story is complex and riveting, and while author Christian McKay Heidicker takes some time to get through the first few stories, the pace picks up midway. He weaves the tales together seamlessly, somehow bringing heart and depth to these harsh, terrifying adventures.","Parents need to know that Christian McKay Heidicker's Scary Stories for Young Foxes, illlustrated by Junyi Wu, is a 2020 Newbery Honor Book. It's a gorgeously written, no-holds-barred set of intertwining horror stories centering on Uly and Mia, two young foxes separated from their litters and in constant fear of death. The book is layered and complex, combining themes of domestic violence, bullying because of a disability, shame, fear, and pain with the deep love between a mother and her kits, and the growing loyalty between friends. None of the violence or pain is gratuitous, though: The hunts, the methods of survival, the dominance of some and shunning of others are all accurate, and the violence is similar to that of realistic nature shows. This book is not an easy read academically or emotionally, but it's intensely rewarding and thought provoking.

All We Can Do Is Wait,"Teens face tragedy in compelling, edgy coming-of-ager.","In ALL WE CAN DO IS WAIT, a group of teens gathers in a Boston emergency room, each waiting to learn the fate of loved ones when a busy road bridge over the Mystic River collapses. As the wait drags on over many hours, the teens get to know one another bit by bit: who they're waiting for, what their lives are like, what events in the past have shaped them, and what they hope for the future. As they worry about the present and the future, they remember past events, exploring a wide range of emotions and experiences. But can they learn how to face grief, love, fear, determination, friends, family, and lives that will never be the same?
","Richard Lawson's debut is an edgy, compelling, unique, and moving tapestry of teens' lives and emotions. All We Can Do Is Wait plunks a group of teens into the not-terribly-interesting setting of a hospital waiting room and allows the drab backdrop to fade away as the spotlight shines on each character, taking them in turns while also weaving back and forth in time. There's always something to keep the pages turning, whether it's what happened that fateful summer or what happened to a sister who was driving across the bridge the moment it collapsed.
Although some characters are more likable than others, we can all feel empathy for them as they go through what for many of us is our worst nightmare realized. And amid ll the grief, fear, and anxiety there's also a lot of hope for what we can become, and how we can get through the tough times together. Best for mature teens and up who can handle some of the edgy content involving alcohol, marijuana, and sex.","Parents need to know that All We Can Do Is Wait is an edgy coming-of-ager that explores grief, death, fear, friendship, love, family, and more. The plot centers on teens waiting in an emergency room to learn the fate of loved ones missing after a bridge collapse involving massive casualties; death, fear of the unknown, and grief are prominent themes. Other violence includes memories of an abuser who slams the girl into a mirror, grabs hard enough to leave dark bruises, and throws things. Blood's mentioned a few times along with some injuries, but there's no gore and no detail. Sexually active teens, in same-sex and opposite-sex couples, mention kissing, making out, and having sex, but nothing's described in detail. A gay character struggles with hiding his true self and coming out to his family. Strong language includes ""s—t,"" ""f—k,"" ""tits,"" and more. A few characters drink heavily and regularly use marijuana and regulated drugs like Adderall and Xanax. Drinking at parties or while hanging out is frequently mentioned. A minor character smokes, and two teens share an electronic cigarette. Positive messages reinforce the need for people to be there for each other in bad times, and not to be afraid of the future but to face whatever it has in store for you.

His father and his best friend, Billy, are both killed accidentally within a month, and Eddie is the one who finds both bodies. Now he's being haunted by Billy, who's lso the narrator of the story. His mother is being drawn further in to a fundamentalist church, led by Reverend Tarter, who's lso an English teacher at Eddie's school and is trying to manipulate Eddie into joining the saved, while working with his congregation to get a book banned at school. That book, Warren Peece, is a made-up book by the real author of this book, Chris Crutcher, who becomes a character in his own book when he gets involved in the effort to stop the banning. And that book happens to be the only meaningful thing Eddie has found to help him deal with his grief. So Eddie, though he hasn't spoken since he found Billy's body, is determined to save the book, and to take down the reverend at the same time.
","This story of a book-banning makes a provocative case for freedom, but sometimes the characters seem to act s the author's mouthpiece. The Sledding Hill is a diatribe cloaked in humor, a mostly enjoyable read that addresses a compelling issue in a way that will get kids talking.
In real life, Chris Crutcher's books have been the target of censorship efforts, and here he takes on would-be book-banners directly by writing a book in which they will find no bad language, sex acts, or violence, but the content is designed to be objectionable to them anyway.

Julie of the Wolves,Thought-provoking saga of Inuit girl adopted by wolf pack.,"In JULIE AND THE WOLVES, Julie/Miyax escapes her village and her husband, becomes lost and lone on the Arctic tundra, and survives by joining a wolf pack. Lyrical text portrays the interdependence between people and animals in the harsh but beautiful Alaskan environment. As Miyax learns to communicate with the wolves, her physical hardships mirror the plight of Inuit culture s it faces Westernization and modern technology.
","This tale of a young girl's harrowing trek across the Arctic tundra thoughtfully explores the situation Native peoples face when their culture is threatened by Westernization. As Miyax recalls her ""Eskimo"" upbringing and learns to survive on the tundra, readers learn about the science of ""Eskimo"" culture and its interdependence with native plants and animals. Miyax uses native and natural wisdom to gain acceptance by the wolf pack that saves her life.
As Miyax (and the reader) becomes more steeped in ""Eskimo"" ways, she reconsiders her decision to leave Alaska. Julie and the Wolves invites readers to decide whether traditional Inuit culture can survive in the face of Americanization, and whether individuals can make a difference within their society.","Parents need to know that 1973 Newbery Medal winner Julie and the Wolves, by Jean Craighead George, is the story of a young ""Eskimo"" girl (actually Inuit) named Miyax.

Forced into an arranged marriage at 13 to the mentally challenged son of her father's best friend, she flees after he tries to rape her, and survives in the Alaskan tundra by joining a wolf pack. Other violence incudes the wolf pack attacking and killing a straggler wolf, a hunter shooting  wolf from a plane, and a bird dying. Poetic text, simple illustrations, and the exploration of the impact of Western civilization on the natural world and Native culture enrich the saga of Miyax's adoption by the wolves and her trek across the Arctic. The book is considered a classic and often assigned in middle and high school.

Observation of the natural world, the author proposes. This deceptively simple idea forms the basis of this stunning picture book. Composed without words, Anno's work relies on detailed illustrations to stimulate children's natural curiosity, gently encouraging them to compare and count.
 ","This extraordinary counting book has both great kid appeal and a sound educational basis. Mitsumasa Anno's systematic increase of objects in the illustrations naturally leads young children to count. His illustrations invite extended examination and are the source of the book's success.
The pictures' myriad details are real kid-pleasers -- careful observers can seek out subtle hints indicating what will develop next in the town, discover what the woman is hanging on her laundry line, notice what the children are playing with, etc. All the while, the reader is absorbing fundamental ideas and basic building blocks of mathematical understanding. Very young children can benefit too, with the assistance of an adult.","Parents need to know that pastoral scenes, rendered in bright watercolors and containing a multitude of intriguing details, capture readers' attention, and the format invites them to respond to the changing landscape of objects.

The Girl Who Soared Over Fairyland and Cut the Moon in Two,September goes on a moon mission in compelling installment.,"As September's 14th birthday comes and goes and she takes on more adult responsibilities, she fears that maybe she's too old to go back to Fairyland, that the place she loves no longer wants her. When her transport arrives unexpectedly, she's quickly sent on a mission to Fairyland's moon. Her joyous reunion with friends Ell and Saturday soon leads to many dangers on the quest, encounters with strange characters, and challenging surprises as they cope with the growing complexities of inter-species, inter-world friendship.
","Author Catherynne M. Valente's vivid imagination and prose continue in epic form in THE GIRL WHO SOARED OVER FAIRYLAND AND CUT THE MOON IN TWO, the third volume of the Fairyland series. Her narrative voice hustles September along the path of adventure, often pausing to deliver pithy lectures on subjects from the troubles caused by lies to fate vs. free will, all the while throwing off hilariously erudite one-liners and heartrending bits of emotional insight on the way to a cliff-hanger ending. Once again, Ana Juan's illustrations are surreal, poignant, funny, and immensely appealing.","Parents need to know that the fantastic imagination, exuberant narrative, unforgettable characters, and ethical quandaries that make the two previous Fairyland books so compelling are back in full force in The Girl Who Soared Over Fairyland and Cut the Moon in Two. Protagonist September is now two years older than when the series started and grappling with grown-up issues, from helping her family to the heartbreak of living between two worlds and constantly being torn from her loved ones. Some of the teen-parent relationship nuances, romantic misunderstandings, and urgent conflicts may be lost on younger readers. World War II still weighs on the story. There are scary scenes of earthquakes, conflict, and cataclysms, and many species seem to have been annihilated; the missing paw of a mutilated creature plays a fateful role. Two young characters kiss and hold hands. A being gives birth in a joyous event that involves a lot of gore.

"Rattlesnake Dance: True Tales, Mysteries, and Rattlesnake Ceremonies","Gripping, first-rate storytelling.","First-rate storytelling keeps readers on the edge of their seats as they follow the fate of a plucky nine-year-old snakebite victim. The author--the subject of the snakebite tale that opens the book--weaves true-life stories of her encounters with snakes in the American West with rattler lore and facts. Her fascination with--and respect for--rattlesnakes is infectious.
 ","Warning: Once readers fall under the spell of RATTLESNAKE DANCE, they'll have a hard time wrestling loose from its reptilian grip. The book's descriptive passages are as sharp as rattler fangs.
The autobiographical tales provide the perfect backdrop for amazing rattlesnake facts: Heart patients take rattlesnake venom as medication (it poses no danger when swallowed), human saliva is as toxic to rattlesnakes as their venom is to us, and more people die of lightning strikes each year than from snakebites. The author's third autobiographical story, about a pair of rattlers engaged in a macho wrestling match, lacks the human-interest angle that fortifies the first two. Still, readers will be entertained by the tale of two male snakes at odds in the Wyoming prairie. And the thoughtful, subtle illustrations, punctuated by vibrant detail, add another dimension of reality to the bracing stories.","Parents need to know that fascinating facts punctuate these first-person tales, which reassure that most snakebite victims survive.

Between the Lines,"Mother and daughter team up to write fun, modern fairy tale.","Misfit Delilah is embarrassed to be so obsessed with a fairy tale she finds in her school library, but when she realizes she can communicate with the story's handsome prince, she really has a secret to keep. Meanwhile, Prince Oliver is quite taken with the brown-eyed reader and wants to get out of his scripted world and into hers (even if he's quite confused about how a computer works and why Delilah would choose to wear something as immodest as blue jeans). Can they work together to set Oliver free? Or will he be stuck rescuing a vapid princess forever -- while Delilah faces off against vapid high school royalty on her own?
","Written by a famous author (Jodi Picoult wrote Change of Heart and My Sister's Keeper, among others), and her teen daughter, this YA novel takes a bit of time to get into. Part of this pacing problem is due to the story's structure:  Delilah and Oliver not only take turns narrating from their points of view, but the original fairy tale is also told in interstitial chapters.
Even so, tweens will eventually be swept up in BETWEEN THE LINES' romantic premise and in the clever idea that characters have rich lives when readers aren't reading their stories; for example, when the book is closed, Prince Oliver finds the main villain putting sprinkles on cookies. In the end, there's enough humor and clever plot turns to keep the story moving. It's hard not to smile when a vapid princess realizes that she's actually in love with the prince's loyal basset hound -- or when a misfit girl risks everything to rescue her prince.","Parents need to know that Between the Lines is a romantic fantasy about a girl who can communicate with a prince in a fairy tale. There's some kissing, hand holding, confessions of love, and even a marriage proposal. Within the fairy tale itself, Prince Oliver is in peril, facing the dragon who killed his father, being imprisoned by pirates who threaten him with torture, and battling a sword-wielding villain. In real life, Delilah and Oliver don't always act perfectly (she sneaks out of her room, leaving her mother frantic, and he takes Delilah into his fantasy world without asking her whether it's what she wants). Even so, they risk everything to be together and ultimately learn to think about more than their own happiness.

Witch and Wizard,"Clever premise, but charmless, dark, and too violent.","Fifteen-year-old Wisty Allgood and her 17-year-old brother Whit awaken to a nightmare: soldiers invade their home and drag them to prison. Overnight, a new world order is established, and witchcraft, along with science and other magic, is outlawed. Wisty and Whit are convicted as witch and wizard and sentenced to death as soon as they turn 18. Although they had no idea they had magical powers, Wisty discovers the ability to start fires and turn people into animals. They break out of prison to find their parents, but find a resistance army of other teens and children, multiple realities, and a very violent world in chaos. Troops patrol the streets and children are living like refugees. As they search for their parents they also discover they are the subjects of a prophecy that only Wiccans can save the world from the new evil empire.
","WITCH AND WIZARD is too scary and violent for young readers, and not likely exciting or engaging enough for older teen readers. Patterson is known for his action-packed thrillers, but this one is hardly compelling. Whit and Wisty are likable, and the Allgood family dynamic is close and caring, but the teens soon learn that their parents kept many secrets from them, and there is no discussion of their duplicity or their motives. The military enforcers are portrayed as stupid, but how did The One Who Writes Decrees find enough stupid and willing soldiers to overthrow the entire world? And why in the world are these witches and wizards Wiccan?
There is no charm or whimsy, none of the fresh world building found in other popular fantasies of the past decade. There is nothing about this story that is new or thrilling. It makes an un-challenging, OK, light read. The most entertaining part is the list of ""Especially Offensive Books That Have Been Banned"" in the postscript.","Parents need to know that this is a dystopian novel that pits adults against children. While there's no gore, the violence is pervasive and intense -- the opening scene is two teens being led to death in a public execution.

The Allgood family is eventually revealed as Wiccan, and there are prophecies that Wiccans will save the world.

When Dimple Met Rishi,Opposites begin to attract in sweet arranged-union tale.,"WHEN DIMPLE MET RISHI, it didn't go at all well -- no big surprise, as Rishi blurted out,""Hello, future wife,"" and Dimple had absolutely no idea who he was or why he'd say such a crazy thing. While Rishi knew that Dimple would be attending the website and app-development competition, Dimple's family had not let her in on the parents' plan to fix up their teens. To complicate matters even more, Dimple (on her way to Stanford) has absolutely no interest in finding the I.I.H. (Ideal Indian Husband) while Rishi (on his way to MIT) thinks the idea of an arranged marriage might be quite a sensible one. Dimple's determined to never ever have anything to do with Rishi, but then they find themselves partnered up at the competition. A truce ensues as they begin to work together and even venture out on a ""non-date."" As the opposites begin to attract, they learn how small their differences really are, and Dimple gives Rishi the courage to tell his parents what he really wants to do with his life. ","This heartwarming, funny, romantic tale explores serious coming-of-age issues: honoring tradition in a modern world, becoming independent, and making good choices about love. When Dimple Met Rishi portrays Dimple and Rishi's blended world of conservative Indian culture and tech nerds in a way that will be instantly relatable not only to readers who come from Indian families but also to any teens who've ever been misunderstood by their parents or felt like an outsider. Dimple and Rishi might be geeky, but they're feisty, funny geeks who will constantly surprise readers as their true personalities emerge. Who would have expected Rishi to be confident and take charge on a first date or that Dimple would find she could dance like a character out of a Bollywood movie? While the idea of arranged marriages is central to the plot of the novel, it's made clear that neither set of parents would ever pressure Dimple or Rishi to marry someone they didn't love.

","As in his previous novels, Schmidt throws a lot of complexity and subplots in here, and this time not all of them are a comfortable fit or lead anywhere.
There are horror stories that involve werewolves, vampires, and other monsters of myth and fantasy, creatures that crawl out of overwrought imaginations and nighttime fears. And then there are the horror stories that involve the ordinary, everyday ways that human beings treat and mistreat one another. The first type can be fun, if you have a taste for that sort of thing. The second, especially in the hands of a master, is simply horrific; the kind of thing that, while you are reading it or thinking about it, makes it hard to breathe, or swallow, or see clearly through unshed tears.
And that's just the first half of what is really two stories in one novel. The second half, considerably lighter than the first, though not without its own horrors, is the road trip of three teen boys, each of them unknowingly seeking understanding and redemption. All the different subplots are fascinating, and each, such as a crew race or the discovery of the wreckage of a slave ship, has metaphorical resonance with the main story. Schmidt has emerged as a writer of rare power who spins emotionally and intellectually complex tales in a gorgeously literary style that makes every scene, every setting, every passing breeze, spring vividly and completely to life.","Parents need to know that this book will encourage teens to think about racism and what its effects can be. The central event is a gruesome accident in which a boy's arm is torn off, and from which he eventually dies.  There is racial bullying, name-calling, and other violence -- but teens will be moved by the story here as three teen boys seek understanding and redemption.

Honor Girl,"Absorbing, bittersweet, same-sex camp romance.","Maggie's been spending her summers at Camp Bellflower since forever, mostly because both her mother and grandmother went there too. The summer she's 15, she finds herself falling for 19-year-old counselor, Erin. First love is a rollercoaster ride, and Maggie experiences ups and downs as she tries to figure out her feelings. One thing that helps is the rifle range, where she's able to clear her mind and get to within two targets of a Distinguished Expert certificate. But summer passes quickly, and before she knows it it's time to go home, without even a real good-bye from Erin. Two years later, Maggie's traveling with her family and arranges to see Erin again. Are the same feelings there, and are they real?
","Maggie Thrash's debut graphic-novel memoir is absorbing, intriguing, and bittersweet, nd teens will easily and immediately relate to the ups and downs of first love. Thrash's confusion about falling for a girl is explored, although it seems no more or less confusing than being 15 and falling for someone of the opposite sex. HONOR GIRL succeeds because instead of focusing only on the same-sex aspect of the experience, Thrash takes the reader through the wide range of feelings involved in falling in love, giving the memoir universal appeal.
The illustrations have a child-like charm, use an appealing color palette, and are equally effective conveying action and a sense of place -- both emotional and physical. Thrash's unusual treatment of the eyes is a bit disconcerting at first, and occasionally it's a bit difficult to tell what you're looking at, but even so, it's easy to become absorbed in both the graphics and the narration. Maybe it's even fair play to catch the reader as off-guard as Thrash herself sometimes feels.","Parents need to know that Honor Girl is a graphic-novel memoir. Author Maggie Thrash (a staff writer for the online magazine for teen girls Rookie) looks back at her first love at an all-girls summer camp when she was 15, where she falls in love with 19-year-old counselor Erin. There's a lot of talking and thinking about being in love, crushing on someone, and feeling attraction. And there's a lot of confusion because Maggie didn't expect to fall for a girl. She hears some thinly veiled homophobic remarks from camp personnel, but her friends are unconcerned about the same-sex issue and are supportive. Hand-holding is illustrated several times, and a couple of fantasy/dream sequences show two girls kissing. Strong language is infrequent but includes ""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" and ""bitch.""

"The Hangman's Revolution: W.A.R.P., Book 2",Time-travel series by Artemis Fowl author stays amazing.,"In an alternate present, 17-year-old Chevie is in big trouble with her superiors at Boxite Youth Academy. She's hearing voices and having visions of her FBI agent self from the former present trying to tell her about a Timepod, its creator Professor Charles Smart, and some boy named Riley in the past. The alternative present is a dictatorship led by ""blessed"" Colonel Box. Box knows about the old Chevie, too, and knows it'd be dangerous if her FBI self came roaring back and suddenly knew all about him. Box used the very same FBI Timepod with a plot to take 21st-century weapons back to Victorian England and take over the world. It'd be bad news for him if Chevie found him out. With the help of two of his Thundercats -- steroid-fed warrior women from the Boxite academy -- Colonel Box sends Chevie to Professor Smart's house with an order to kill him. Chevie's pretty sure the Thundercats are ordered to kill her next. Luckily for her, Charles Smart lives up to his name. As soon as Chevie arrives with the Thundercats, he starts secretly booting up his Timepod. But, sadly, Smart is shot and killed by one of the Thundercats before the machine is ready and ends up sending Chevie and the Thundercats into the wormhole back to Victorian London instead. But all is not lost. As Chevie's two selves combine, suddenly her mission is crystal clear. She must be the one to find Colonel Box before he launches his revolution. To do that she'll need her old friend Riley's help, especially with two merciless Thundercats on her tail. 
","Wading through the sewers is 100 percent worth it for this book's explosive, nail-biting ending.
Readers at the end of The Reluctant Assassin (spoiler alert for Book 1) had to be wondering how the series could go on without the deliciously evil Garrick. He was such a riveting and unforgettable bad guy. But, shockingly, in THE HANGMAN'S REVOLUTION you hardly miss him. Colonel Box and Farley, the hangman of the title, are both fantastic, power-hungry bad guys. And there's so much conniving and scheming between the fanatical Thundercats and the nefarious Rams gang, Chevie and Riley have their hands full trying to save the world from some pretty awful alternate present/future.
Most of the story takes place in Victorian London, and readers will find themselves totally immersed in that world, through the rich, playful language of the characters (Figary the butler and King Otto in particular) right down to the rich, powerful smells of the city and its sewers. Yes, just as in Book 1, readers will need pretty strong stomachs (wait until you find out what ""toshing"" is -- ew). Worth noting for families looking for books with diverse characters: Chevie is a Native American teen who embraces her heritage.","Parents need to know that The Hangman's Revolution is the second time-travel novel in the fantastic W.A.R.P. series by the author of the bestselling Artemis Fowl books. Just as in Book 1, The Reluctant Assassin, the level of violence is best for kids already well versed in PG-13 action movies. Not only re there lots of gun deaths and explosions but also sewer rats that eat people alive and graphic fistfights. Language sticks to variations of ""hell"" and ""damn,"" and plenty of drunk people wander Victorian London -- Figary the butler is drunk most of the time. Chevie and Riley continue to be equally resilient and smart main characters, making this the rare sci-fi read that will appeal both to boy and girl readers.

Grandpa's Great Escape,"Hilarious, poignant tale of boy and grandpa with dementia.","Steeped in World War II lore, GRANDPA'S GREAT ESCAPE is the tale of 12-year-old English village boy Jack, whose best and only friend is his beloved grandfather, a heroic World War II flying ace with many thrilling tales. Trouble is, it's 1983, but the old man's mind has been slipping, and now he's living in 1940, ll the time. Jack's happy to relive his exploits with him, but he also knows the old man's unpredictable ways and the aftermath of their adventures are going to be trouble. When trouble finally comes and Grandpa is carted off to the horrible Twilight Towers, where the prisoners -- er, patients -- are drugged, robbed, and otherwise ill-treated, all seems lost. But the wily old Wing Commander and the brave young Squadron Leader are anything but defeated.
","David Walliams and Tony Ross return with a harrowing, hysterical, heartfelt tale of a World War II flying ace and his loving grandson as they battle dementia and authority figures. It's an affectionate tribute to a heroic generation and its exploits -- particularly, as it turns out, with regard to escaping from POW camps. There's a lot of historical detail here (including a helpful reference at the end) about World War II and the battles the characters are reliving, the fine points of various airplanes, etc.
While Grandpa's Great Escape delivers plenty of the intrepid derangement readers expect from Walliams, this one feels more tender and personal than some of the others. You might even want a Kleenex now and then.","Parents need to know that, as the title hints, Grandpa's Great Escape is best-selling British author David Walliams' homage not just to the love between a 12-year-old boy and his grandfather, once an RAF flying ace but now suffering from dementia, but to the entire genre of WWII prisoner-of-war sagas, especially The Great Escape. Set in 1983 in an English village, the story finds young Jack having epic adventures with Grandpa -- or rather, Wing Commander -- s the old man relives the past. After one adventure too many attracts the authorities and lands Grandpa in a creepy, prison-like ""home,"" where the patients are drugged into a stupor and the matron steals their money, the stage is set for stealth, heroics, airplane theft, and other outrageous but cheer-worthy moments. As in other Walliams books, expect some bathroom humor, underwear humor, and occasional nudge nudge, wink wink. But also, a lot of loving, heartfelt, affectionate detail about the Battle of Britain, those who fought it, and those who loved their stories.

Beyond the Bright Sea,Moving adventure story of tween's search for her origins.,"Twelve-year-old Crow may have to look BEYOND THE BRIGHT SEA when a bonfire on a nearby island sparks her curiosity about who her parents were and where they came from. Crow was taken in by Osh, the only person living on a tiny island off the coast of Massachusetts, when she was only a few hours old. She and Osh work hard for the things they need, but they don't need much and have always been content together. But as she grows older and learns more about the world around her, Crow really wants to know more about herself, too. Her search takes her to an orphanage in the city, to a tiny graveyard on a nearby island, and across the path of a madman who'll stop at nothing to find a pirate's treasure.
","Author Lauren Wolk weaves a beautiful tapestry of pirate-treasure adventure, suspense, a search for family, and warm family bonds that'll keep the pages turning and the heartstrings tugging. Beyond the Bright Sea is not as dark and intense as Wolk's YA debut, Wolf Hollow, but the mystery, characters, and vivid sense of place make it hard to put down.
Tweens will relate to Crow as she explores how her family origins define, and don't define, who she is. The rhythmic writing and suspenseful chapter endings make it great for reading aloud, too. Everyone from big kids up to adults will be deeply moved by Crow's adventures and the lessons she learns about family and happiness. Keep a tissue nearby when you get to the end.","Parents need to know that Beyond the Bright Sea is the second children's book by the author of Wolf Hollow. It's not as dark or emotionally intense, but there are themes of loss in the story of a stillborn child in the past nd a 12-year-old adopted child's search for her birth parents. There's  scary bad guy and suspense, and blood's mentioned a few times but not described in detail. The book explores themes of family (especially adoption), identity, and belonging. Great messages about how the family you make isn't less real or important than family you're born into, and the main characters all are positive role models for love, loyalty, and unwavering support of one another.

Three Truths and a Lie,"Teens are stalked by killer in fast-paced, edgy thriller.","THREE TRUTHS AND A LIE begins in a tattoo parlor as high school seniors Mia, Galen, Rob, nd Liam wait their turn to get matching spiderwebs inked on their arms. Galen is Mia's part-hipster, part-jock boyfriend, nd Rob (who narrates the novel) is Liam's new boyfriend. After some tough criminal types show up at the tattoo shop looking for Galen, the two couples decide to escape for the weekend to an isolated lakeside cabin owned by Mia's parents. The first night, they play a party game called Three Truths and a Lie, which reveals one of them may have committed a murder several years before. After that, things begin to go terribly wrong. Their satellite phone disappears, there's a mysterious fire, their car is disabled -- nd they're being stalked by a killer.  ","Two teenage couples, a long-buried secret, lots of sexual tension, a creepy cabin in the woods, and a killer on the loose make for a chilling page-turner. Brent Hartinger's novels featuring gay and bisexual teens are both popular and well-reviewed, so his handling of the relationship between Liam and Rob and the pair's conflicts with Galen is both sensitive and insightful.
Teens who are regular viewers of shows such as Game of Thrones or fans of writers such as Stephen King may find the novel's ""scare"" quotient a bit low, but it will suit readers who want a thriller that isn't nightmare-inducing and lacks large quantities of gore. A clever twist should surprise most readers. ","Parents need to know that Brent Hartinger's Three Truths and a Lie is a psychological thriller about two teen couples (one straight and one gay) who spend a terrifying weekend at an isolated cabin in Washington state. Soon after their arrival, strange things begin to happen, and it becomes apparent that someone is stalking them with murderous intentions. Sexual tension between the couples is constantly in the background, both couples have sex during the weekend, and the sex between Liam and Rob is somewhat graphically described. Strong language (""a--hole,"" ""f--k,"" ""bitch"") is used casually in conversation. Violence is graphic (there's a vicious attack, a poisoning, and a strangulation -- one of which may not be what it seems), but it's not as intense or explicit as the violence in many popular books or on cable TV shows. Hartinger is the Lambda Award-winning author of young adult novels about gay and bisexual teens, including Spilt Screen and Geography Club.

The Lo-Down: Life and Love in the Hollywood Hills,"Friendly, positive relationship advice for teens.","Lo Bosworth, made famous on MTV’s Laguna Beach and The Hills, shares her advice for finding – and landing – the perfect boyfriend. Geared toward teens and very young adults, she describes warning signs of bad relationships, encouraging signs of good ones, and discusses how both men and women can nurture or sabotage a relationship. Her essential message to be true to yourself, and true love will follow.
","Bosworth’s casual, intimate style comes across as a girlfriend trying to help a younger friend. Her advice is fairly conventional, but her strength is her understanding of how teen girls think and act (she published this at the ripe old age of 24). There are quizzes, recipes, and plenty of anecdotes to draw readers in. Bosworth even offers practical advice for dating in the age of social media, addressing texting and Facebook etiquette.
Even so, her values are more of the old-fashioned variety -- and she puts a lot of emphasis on being true to yourself. Bosworth uses puzzle pieces as a metaphor, arguing that only two pieces are an exact fit, and there's no point trying to force a match. Relationships require flexibility and work, she says, but girls shouldn't reinvent themselves or it won't work. Readers won't respond to everything in this book, but they will be encouraged by the overall message: Believe in yourself, and don't settle for a relationship that makes you doubt your worth.","Parents need to know that this chatty book offers a self-confidence boost to girls wading into the dating scene. Sexual behavior is barely touched on as focus is on nurturing confidence and maturity, with respecting yourself before trying to develop a serious relationship. It doesn't offer much in the way of deep insights, but it's a harmless, fun choice for the genre. Teens will recognize the name Lo Bosworth: The author is a reality television star who appeared on Laguna Beach and The Hills -- and she launched a relationship website along with her book.

Monstrous Devices,"Toy robots come to life in fun, creepy European adventure.","In MONSTROUS DEVICES, tin toy robots are anything but toys and a boy's trip to Europe with his granddad is anything but a vacation. Alex lives a quiet life in a British suburb with his mother, going to school and putting up with vicious attacks from bullies. He has a small collection of old tin, wind-up robots from his grandfather, his dead father's father. One day, he receives another robot in the mail, with a note telling him this particular one is very special. Little does he know that this small toy is about to set off a series of chases, battles, and investigations into old legends across France and Prague. Danger lurks around every corner in the form of a mysterious, violent gang and toy robots come to life. While on the run from (and sometimes straight into) perilous situations, Alex tries to unravel his grandfather's secrets, the true story of his father's death, and the mystery around his own early health issues. He learns he's stronger and more resilient than he ever imagined.
","In this fun, fast-paced adventure story, 13-year-old Alex gets way more than he bargained for when he receives a small toy robot from his grandfather. The robots in Monstrous Devices are just that: monstrous. Many come to life and are used as weapons by a mysterious crew hunting Alex and his grandfather in pursuit of Alex's latest robot, which possibly holds the secret to a powerful legend. Author Damien Love creates a wonderful duo in Alex and his grandfather. Alex is a nice, sensible, relatable character, and his grandfather is funny, dashing, and brave. The imagery throughout the book is beautiful. Like the creepy toy robots in the story, the places and unusual characters come alive on the page, putting the reader right in the action with the characters.
The story itself is structured as a series of chase scenes and fights held together with a golem legend and mysteries around Alex's father and grandfather. The excitement in the various battles is well executed and fun, but some of the action gets repetitive after a while. When it comes to many of the questions involving Alex's dad and grandfather threaded throughout the action, the book leaves a little too much hanging. In fact, there's so much left unresolved, it seems a Book 2 must be in the works.","Parents need to know that Damien Love's Monstrous Devices is an adventure and mystery story involving a 13-year-old English boy and his daring grandfather. Alex's grandfather has given him many wind-up toy robots over the years. The latest one is highly sought after by some dangerous people, which sets off lots of dangerous chases and fights in France and Prague. The crew pursuing Alex and his grandfather are creepy, violent, and relentless, and some of the scenes might be too intense for younger readers. The Golem of Prague legend is central to the story, which could interest kids who like myths and fantasy. Family bonds and trust feature prominently and make for good discussion points for families. Other than the chases and attacks, the content is tame, with no swearing or sex and very little drinking or smoking.

Charlotte's Web,"Gentle, much-loved barnyard classic delights all ages.","When Fern convinces her father not to kill the runt pig of the litter, she names him Wilbur and raises him with a bottle. Soon Wilbur goes to live in her Uncle Homer Zuckerman's barn down the road, where she visits him every day. But when she's not there, Wilbur is lonely -- the sheep, cows, geese, and even the rats don't want to play and be his friend. Then he meets Charlotte, a gray spider whose web is in a corner of the barn door, and they become good friends. But soon after, they learn that Wilbur is to be slaughtered next Christmas to make ham and bacon. So Charlotte hatches a plan to make the Zuckermans want to keep Wilbur around forever.
","One of the all-time great classics of children's literature, this gentle story with its kindly wisdom about friendship and love has survived and prospered even in the digital age. That's because its themes are universal and timeless: It will inspire readers to think about how we should make and keep friends, and how we should treat each other. Though most readers will cry near the end, it's never maudlin or sappy. Indeed, it's New Yorker editor and author E.B. White's avoidance of cuteness, astringent prose, whimsical humor, and matter-of-factness about life-and-death issues that sets CHARLOTTE'S WEB apart from the pack.
His heroine is a hairy spider who sucks the blood out of flies, aided by a rat, and they're working to save Wilbur from the reality of every working barn. Kind people can be ugly and sometimes cruel, others can be greedy but helpful, snooty but caring. The world can be harsh but also beautiful and warm.

The advice of experts proved useless, and he found no easy tricks for ""making it"" -- but he did realize that ""making it"" might not matter much. He did learn how it feels to struggle, despair, hope, and doubt. And he learned that he's far from alone. It takes faith to jump anyway, despite fear and uncertainty -- and support and understanding can help dreamers find the courage to make that leap.
","Kids hear lots of sunny platitudes about believing in their dreams, but Jason Reynolds gets honest in his book-length poem: Chasing dreams can be hard, lonely, confusing, infuriating -- and worth it. He describes For Every One as a letter he began writing years ago for himself, riddled with self-doubt and frustration. Now a successful author, Reynolds (As Brave As You) still isn't convinced he's ""made it,"" but he's learned that feeling the passion is more important than the destination.
Reynolds writes vividly, using rich similes to describe his dream as a rabid beast that infected him in one section, and in another comparing it to a colicky baby: ""Sometimes I think/ it needs to be changed./ Usually it just/ needs to be fed./ So I feed it everything/ I have./ And/ it feeds me everything/ I have."" He may not have easy answers, but he has generous compassion fellow travelers will treasure.","Parents need to know that For Every One is a stirring free-verse book by Jason Reynolds (The Boy in the Black Suit) about the frustration and rewards of pursuing your passion. Reynolds, who originally presented the poem at the 2011 opening of the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial, writes frankly about his own self-doubt and pain as he became a successful writer. He rejects any notion that he has advice or tips to share, and discourages readers from getting too caught up in realizing their dreams. Instead, Reynolds notes that the struggle itself is enriching, and offers compassion, empathy, and words he hopes might provide comfort and encouragement. As lonely as the road can seem, he offers reassurance that plenty of dreamers are following the same path.

The Fowl Twins,Artemis Fowl spin-off is clever and action-packed.,"In THE FOWL TWINS, 11-year-old Myles and Beckett are on their own for the weekend on their family's Irish island. Their parents are on a short trip, and big-brother Artemis and his bodyguard, Butler, are on their way to Mars. Well, they think they're on their own until a sniper on a neighboring island, the nefarious Lord Teddy Bleedham-Drye, takes a shot at a toy-size troll breaching the surface of the Earth. Three things happen at once: The toy troll, shrink-wrapped by the special bullet, is pocketed by Beckett -- he thinks it's an actual toy and not a fairy; the Fowl's fancy security system shuts down the compound; and a police fairy flying by in an invisible suit sees the whole thing. Nothing should be able to get in or out of the Fowl compound, but somehow a nun, Sister Jeronima, from a secret organization (acronym of ACRONYM) intent on finding and experimenting on fairies, breaches their system and whisks the boys away. The twins wake up in a secret prison in Amsterdam ready to do anything they can to escape.
","This spin-off series is both exceedingly clever and action-packed, and will satisfy readers who miss the fairy world and Artemis Fowl's genius antics. Myles can easily be compared to Artemis, and always wants to one-up his older brother's accomplishments. And while Butler was always the one keeping Artemis in check, here we have Myles' twin, Beckett. He runs on pure instinct, performs expert-level martial arts moves (guard your knee caps), and has a secret connection to all living things that we won't give away here. Author Eoin Colfer also presents us with some fabulous villains, as he always does: the eternal-youth-obsessed evil genius Lord Teddy Bleedham-Drye and the militant interrogation expert Sister Jeronima Gonzalez-Ramos de Zarate of Bilbao. The names alone are priceless. As is the name of Sister Jeronima's secret organization, with an acronym of ACRONYM.
The Fowl Twins takes these unforgettable characters and puts them in plenty of nail-biting chase scenes and double-cross situations. There are boat chases, plane ejector seats, cliff dives, and prison breaks. And there's not one, but two, private islands full of high-tech gadgets. Strap into your self-regenerating fairy suit. This series is off to an exciting start.","Parents need to know that Eoin Colfer'sThe Fowl Twins is the first book in an Artemis Fowl spin-off series that involves the exploits of Artemis' 11-year-old brothers, Myles and Beckett.

Escape involves some fighting (though Beckett is talented enough at martial arts to incapacitate and not harm the goons after him), a boat chase, falling buildings, cliff dives, and firing weapons (mostly the kind that simply shrink-wrap prey, but real bullets once). Terrible injuries are magically mended. Language is mild and rare (""damned,"" ""bloody,"" ""blooming hell""), and one adult drinks brandy until drunk and smokes a cigar. Readers will enjoy how different the twins are from each other. Myles is what we'd traditionally call a genius, but Beckett is the one with the great instincts, and some great advice for Myles. When one of Myles' plans doesn't work and he feels like he failed, Beckett tells him not to mope about the past. ""Say good-bye to old-failure Myles, and hello to new-plan Myles.""

The Gruffalo,Clever mouse puts brains to work in this children's classic.,"A little mouse walking through the woods encounters a series of would-be predators, but he scares them off by telling them that he's on his way to meet a fierce gruffalo (""His eyes are orange. His tongue is black. He has purple prickles all over his back."") But after escaping a fox, an owl, and a snake, the mouse actually comes face to face with the creature from his imagination.
","The short rhymes and their repetitive structure make THE GRUFFALO a fun book to read aloud. It's true that the mouse is constantly in peril: he's threatened repeatedly by a series of animals who want to eat him -- from a fox to an owl to the gruffalo himself -- but kids won't really worry about his fate. Instead, they'll be impressed with his composure and cleverness. And even with his spiky back and black tongue, the gruffalo manages to look more silly than truly terrifying. Parents, get ready: Your kids are going to want you to read this one again and again -- and they might enjoy the animated special based on the book, too.
The illustrator uses vibrant colors to create the mouse (and gruffalo's!) forest world. His cartoons are all set in the daytime -- so the illustrations never feel ominous. He has been quoted as saying that his original gruffalo was too terrifying -- but readers will be sure to find the final version more silly than scary.","Parents need to know that this classic children's book teaches kids that might doesn't always make right as a clever mouse outsmarts predators much bigger than he is. The mouse is threatened repeatedly by a series of animals who want to eat him -- from a fox to an owl to the gruffalo himself. But he never looks afraid, and kids won't really worry about his fate. Kids will have no trouble rooting for the little mouse who uses his brain to outsmart would-be predators.

Touch the Earth,Cartoony mix of fun and soft science in environmental tale.,"In TOUCH THE EARTH, a feather becomes a magical plane, the White Feather Flier, that takes the reader on a ""helping adventure,"" traveling to areas of the Earth that have problems with water. It delivers drinking water to people who need it, cleans up the ocean and returns the fish, irrigates the desert, and delivers a water-filtration machine, before returning home. Readers push flat ""buttons"" on the page and tilt the book to pretend they’re flying the plane and fixing problems, and they can see the changes they've made when they turn the page.
","This picture book about environmental problems and their solutions is playful and fun and may work as a very basic introduction to the issues. Touch the Earth has some fun interactive elements, successfully involving kids as it teaches concepts such as the directions north, south, east, and west. But it sometimes oversimplifies problems -- for instance, having kids address them merely by touching the flat ""buttons"" on the page. ""Push the FISH button to bring the fish back."" When the reader turns the page, fish have magically returned to a clean ocean. Similarly, after the concept of irrigation is explained -- we ""bring water to where the land is too dry"" -- readers see the desert bloom, but there’s no illustration of how irrigation might actually be brought in. In trying to be kid-friendly, the text sometimes underestimates kids' ability to grasp information -- nd their need for it.
Illustrator Smiljana Coh's art has a fun cartoony look. But it strikes an uncomfortable note when it pictures three of the four kids in the plane as white, while all the people in water-challenged areas are brown-skinned. Still, the book might teach kids that our water supply is vulnerable and help develop kids' sense of responsibility.","Parents need to know that Touch the Earth by singer-songwriter Julian Lennon with Bart Davis, illustrated by Smiljana Coh, is an environmentally themed book with an interactive element, the first in A Julian Lennon White Feather Flier Adventure trilogy. Readers are prompted to touch ""buttons"" on the page to address a variety of water-related environmental problems, and when they turn the page, the problem's fixed. The scientific information is basic, but the book might serve as an introduction to the idea that there are water challenges on the planet and that we have a responsibility to address them. The following books in the trilogy are Heal the Earth and Love the Earth.

Sparkle Boy,"Strong family, acceptance rule in sweet stereotype-buster.","Like younger siblings everywhere, 3-year-old Casey, soon to be known as SPARKLE BOY, falls hard for the cool things his older sister Jessie likes -- and shimmery skirts, glittery nail polish, and sparkly bracelets are no exception. Their parents and grandmother are cool with it, but Jessie's not so sure -- that stuff is only for girls, right? When Casey wants to wear all the shiny stuff to the library, their mom says he looks like Casey. Jessie says he looks silly. But when the older kids at the library say he can't be a boy and dress that way, she's suddenly not so sure about that either.
","Skillfully avoiding drama, hysteria, and preachiness, Lesléa Newman delivers a sweet, level-headed story steeped in love and family values about  3-year-old boy obsessed with all things glittery. Peer pressure, gender stereotypes, and a lot of relatable sibling dynamics all play a role here. Supportive adults really shine, but kids, especially big sis Jessie, have to think for themselves and make their own choices. Illustrator Maria Mola brings the characters to life with lots of color, and facial expressions that add a lot to the story.","Parents need to know that Sparkle Boy, by Lesléa Newman (Heather Has Two Mommies), features a 3-year-old boy who loves all the glittery stuff his older sister loves, and causes a stir when he goes out in his ""girly"" finery.

A Weekend With Wendell,Clever writing keeps this humorous tale on target.,"Three days of her cousin Wendell? How can Sophie endure it? Wendell is thoughtless, rude, and selfish. He scares her from the closet and pinches her under the breakfast table, while Sophie does her best to be polite to him. Humorous illustrations, on-target story, and clever writing make for a delightful read.
 ","Kevin Henkes excels in presenting common childhood issues within a humorous, intelligent story. Wendell behaves as a typical 5- or 6-year-old child would like to act. He does everything he wishes, with little consideration for others. And, of course, children know who's right and who's wrong. They naturally empathize with polite Sophie and see the error of Wendell's ways. One 7-year-old said Wendell ""was not being very nice. He was treating Sophie as if she wasn't important, and all people are important.""
The bright, cheerful watercolor-and-ink illustrations capture the characters' emotions, and the illustrations often add extra humor. On one page, the text reads, ""Sophie helped Wendell carry his sleeping bag and suitcase upstairs,"" and the accompanying illustration shows a boisterous Wendell zipping up the stairs empty-handed, while Sophie struggles to carry both the suitcase and the sleeping bag.","Parents need to know that their kids will find a positive role model in Sophie, but there's a bit of tit for tat in the way she ultimately retaliates against her misbehaving cousin that could send the wrong message. Still, children will identify with Sophie and cheer when she stands up for herself. Expressive and amusing illustrations, occasional tongue-in-cheek writing, and a sympathetic main character are a winning combination.

Down and Across,Teen searches for grit in sweet coming-of-age story.,"In DOWN AND ACROSS, Iranian American teen Saaket, or Scott as he prefers to be called, is desperate to break free of his suffocating parents and find his own way in life. His father keeps pushing him toward prestigious, high-earning career paths, but Scott isn't interested. The problem is that he doesn't have any of his own ideas about his future. He's never found a passion or stuck with anything. When his parents leave him alone for a month, Scott abandons the research internship his dad set up for him and takes off for a few days in Washington, D.C. His goal is to get advice from a renowned Georgetown professor famous for her theories on success. On his way to D.C., he meets Fiora, a free spirit and crossword enthusiast. As two days turn into more than three weeks, their friendship leads to some interesting adventures and new friends for Scott, who learns a lot about the world, his family, and himself.
","This coming-of-age story is cute but a little too fill-in-the-blanks formulaic, which is ironic given the crossword theme that runs throughout. In Down and Across, author Arvin Ahmadi writes teen dialogue well and creates in Scott a character you want to root for. Scott feels the push and pull of loving his parents but also chafing under their overbearing demands. Arvin shows the stress some children of immigrant parents experience. Scott's parents sacrificed to come to America and put their hopes and dreams onto him. Because so much of his life has been planned for him, Scott's never had a chance to figure out who he is or what he wants to do. The book doesn't have much of a plot: It's a series of Scott's interactions and adventures when he runs away to Washington, D.C. The characters he meets are fairly standard YA fare: Fiora is straight out of the manic pixie dream girl trope, but with a little bit more depth; Trent is an over-the-top nice Southern gentleman; and Jeanette is a high-strung religious conservative.
On the positive side, in meeting these people who are so different from him, Scott learns to be a keen observer of human nature and learns a lot about himself. Though the story drags here and there, Down and Across is a sweet and earnest read.","Parents need to know that Down and Across is a coming-of-age story about an Iranian American teen boy who runs away on a quest to learn about perseverance and success. Scott lies to his parents about where he is and takes off for Washington, D.C., where he meets new friends and tracks down a Georgetown professor he believes can help him sort out his life. The story examines the effects of the pressure some immigrant parents put on the their children to succeed. Scott learns a lot of good lessons about responsibility and honest relationships. Characters drink in many scenes, including Scott, who's underage. There's some kissing and making out, but it's tame and not graphically described. Characters swear a little (""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" and ""a--hole) and make some questionable decisions, but it is a realistic representation of how young adults behave.

"The Reptile Room: A Series of Unfortunate Events, Book 2","A clever, suspenseful mystery in series.","The welcome return of the ill-fated Baudelaire orphans, whose dark-humored circumstances brighten older readers' days. Here in their second book they again match wits with their greedy and evil Uncle Olaf, and here again Lemony Snicket delights us with entertaining wordplay, the poker-faced narrator, and a droll, but cliff-hanging story.
 ","Snicket does not rely on shock value to keep his audience's interest, but rather animates his bleak comedy with a suspenseful mystery that gathers momentum. He ably handles unhappy emotions that steal over the Baudelaire children -- and probably are experienced by some readers as well -- such as the ""dark and curious feeling of falling that accompanies any great loss.""
This is the second in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events books that follow the rotten, cursed life of the Baudelaire children. This installment plays less on their ill luck -- that can safely be taken for granted -- and more on the story at hand, a mystery cunningly unraveled by the children. Snicket presents it almost like a play, with plenty of detail and a drawing-room atmosphere.","Parents need to know that figuring out what the hideous Uncle Olaf is up to, other than no good, will keep readers' interest roused.

"The Tournament at Gorlan: Ranger's Apprentice: The Early Years, Book 1",Slow start to prequel series with stalwart characters.,"Disturbing rumors have reached Ranger Crowley and Ranger-in-training Halt. The king has gone from being under the protection of Baron Morgarath in Gorlan to potentially being his prisoner. And Prince Duncan is said to be raiding villages in the north and damaging his reputation. Crowley and Halt are determined to find out if there’s truth to anything Morgarath says, but the cunning Baron is a step ahead of them. He's firing all the Rangers and putting foppish men who answer to him in their place. Now it's up to Crowley and Halt to gather up all the fired Rangers, rescue the king, restore honor to the prince's name, and quash a tyrant. Sounds impossible for even an army to accomplish. But for 12 Rangers? No problem.
","This prequel to the Ranger's Apprentice series moves slowly and predictably, but the characters are admirable and stalwart. Readers who enjoyed that series will dig right in, as will anyone who loves a good joust and a look back into medieval times.
THE TOURNAMENT AT GORLAN takes its time getting to the actual tournament, slowly gathering the Rangers, camping with them, buying horses with them, traveling with them. Readers will almost forget what's at stake. Even Crowley and Halt's bold rescue feels five parts set-up and one part breaking-free action. The tournament brings all to a head and finally throws in an unpredictable twist -- and, predictably, sets up an intriguing premise for the series to continue.","Parents need to know that John Flanagan's Tournament at Gorlan is the start to a Ranger's Apprentice prequel series. You can read the prequel series without reading the main series first -- there's even a foreword to get you caught up -- but readers who have read the original series will feel more drawn into this medieval-style world where highly skilled fighters called Rangers are called on to protect a king. The Rangers' weapon of choice is a longbow -- they kill a few enemies that way. Mostly they get past enemies by hitting them on the head or punching them in a few skirmishes. There's only one sad death of a good guy, and he's found after the fact. Ale, wine, and brandy wine show up in many scenes (no one is underage, and one Ranger promises to stop drinking when he gets his job back). Readers familiar with either the Ranger’s Apprentice or Brotherband Chronicles series know what to expect out of Flanagan's characters: The good guys are loyal, resourceful, conscientious, born leaders … the list goes on. Think Captain America with a longbow and camouflage gear.

Their teacher turns out to be patient and kind, helping to bring out the best in each pet as they go through familiar school activities: circle time, arts and crafts, show and tell, and so on. Kitty doesn't seem to have learned much in her day at school, but Miss Dee knows better -- and gets Kitty purring.
","This is another winning entry in Nick Bruel's Bad Kitty series. Kitty certainly isn't a cuddly cat, but she shows here she really can be a good friend. BAD KITTY SCHOOL DAZE will have kids howling with laughter, even as they absorb solid lessons on how to behave and why. They'll see the importance of kindness and empathy, even when it comes in a prickly package.
The bonus material explaining why cats and dogs are so famously incompatible underscores the book's message on redemption and the importance of trying to understand and appreciate each other.","Parents need to know that Bad Kitty School Daze, like the other books in this popular series, delivers some very good messages through the outrageous behavior of its bad-tempered heroine.

Mary Poppins,"Delightful tale of nanny who brings order, magic to family.","When the Banks family of Cherry Tree Lane needs a new nanny to take care of their children -- Jane, Michael, and twin babies John and Barbara -- bossy Mary Poppins appears and ""accepts"" the position on her own terms. She's a woman of few words, and insists on order and excellent manners and conduct, but she also leads the children in magical adventures, where they take tea on the ceiling, visit the North Pole, and watch stars get placed in the sky. The Banks children often wonder if their outings were just dreams. Mainly, they hope that the wind doesn't change.
","MARY POPPINS, the classic children's novel that inspired the beloved Disney musical, is an absolute delight. Readers will notice that the filmmakers took considerable liberties with P.L. Travers' plot and characters, but the spirit and cleverness of Mary come through in both versions. Unique to the novel are Jane and Michael's twin siblings, babies John and Barbara. A chapter entirely devoted to the infants creates a fascinating perspective where babies have special wisdom. Mary Poppins' world is magical and fascinating, and full of life lessons told in strange and wonderful ways.","Parents need to know that Mary Poppins, P.L. Travers' classic children's novel, has some different different plot points and characters from the beloved Disney film adaptation, but the original's charming and magical in its own ways. The book is old-fashioned, with dated gender roles and ideas about child-rearing and manners, but it offers timeless lessons about good conduct and understanding other points of view. Note that early editions of Mary Poppins included a different version of the chapter called ""Bad Tuesday,"" in which Mary, Jane, and Michael use a magical compass to travel around the world in minutes. Travers' original portrayed people of different nationalities (Chinese, Eskimo, African, American Indians), and she was accused of stereotyping. She then wrote a new version, where the travelers encounter local animals instead. In its revised version, Mary Poppins is pure delight. This book also figures in Disney's film Saving Mr. Banks, about the movie giant's efforts to adapt the novel for the big screen. A beautiful illustrated gift edition (shown here) and a lovely picture book adaptation of Mary Poppins come out Oct. 23, 2018, both published by HMH Books for Young Readers.

Popular: Vintage Wisdom for a Modern Geek,Middle schooler tries '50s popularity guide in fun memoir.,"Maya is a self-described ""Social Outcast"" at her middle school in Brownsville, Texas. When she comes across a guide to popularity written in the 1950s, she decides to follow the advice written by a young model -- including wearing pearls, a girdle, and even planning a social event -- to see what will happen to her social world. Along the way, she answers her initial question -- ""Can popularity advice from half a century ago still be relevant?""-- in a sweet and heartfelt way.
","POPULAR: VINTAGE WISDOM FOR A MODERN GEEK has a fun premise, and sweet, smart, sensitive Maya is a girl lots of tween and teen readers can relate to. Her crazy antics -- like wearing a girdle to school! -- will leave readers laughing. But they'll also be touched by some of the personal details she shares: She feels overwhelmed on the her dead sister's birthday, and also when a beloved teacher dies; her school is on the border with Mexico and students face lockdowns and searches from drug-sniffing dog; kids and adults often say hurtful things to her -- and she also catches herself saying inane things to them!.
Readers get a clear look at Maya's home nd school life, and understand that while both can be hard, she sees what's special about them, too. It's these great details and Maya's authentic voice that make her realization that ""most people are waiting to be discovered too"" both believable and poignant.

There's some talk of crushes and some dating. Maya's teacher uses some pretty frank words about body parts and STDs when it comes time for sex education.

A boy on the autism spectrum tells Maya she's beautiful every time she sees him; a teacher tells her to let her know if it ever makes her feel uncomfortable.

One Too Many: A Seek and Find Counting Book,"Great for counting, adding, detail-seeking, and giggling.","A flea bounces over a trough of water in the first scene, and he’s gradually joined by more and more barnyard animals -- two cows, then three horses, and so on until 12 bats swoop over the teeming, chaotic spread. Then one more surprise visitor arrives, and there’s a flutter of hooves and feathers before the trough is still for the night.
","Author/illustrator Gianna Marino serves up a refreshingly vibrant counting book, sure to engage kids just learning to count and those with more sophisticated math literacy skills. Each page introduces a new animal to the increasingly crowded barnyard scene, counting both the number of species and the number of animals: The fifth spread, for example, introduces five sheep. Through it all, the primordial flea leaps on one of the new arrivals in each two-page spread -- a clue to help kids spot the newcomers.
Kids can enjoy this as a rich seek-and-find, and can find a multitude of things to count. Marino includes a few suggestions for making new discoveries, such as searching for animals with their eyes closed, counting the cumulative number of animals, and identifying the unfortunate pig who always has something nibbling his ear. The interaction of the animals infuses the book with sly humor -- their faces speak volumes as they climb atop each other or find their tails being nibbled, make new friends, and just plain get in each other’s way.

Turning 15 on the Road to Freedom: My Story of the Selma Voting Rights March,Vivid recollections of a teen girl in the Selma march.,"Lynda's  student who's ready to make life better for the people she loves. As a civil rights protester, Lynda joins hundreds of students who, each day, stand up in the face of violence and hatred to gain ccess to the basic rights that all other Americans have. She's arrested for protesting nine times before her 15th birthday. After marching on what will be known as Bloody Sunday, Lynda, battered and bloodied, has  choice to make: continue to march or let fear overcome the desire to be free. Does she have what it takes? ","Author Lynda Blackmon Lowery does a nice job adapting her story in an easy-to-follow format for a wide range of readers. Her voice is one that's not often heard; this is a story told from the perspective of a young student protestor involved in the movement. Often the adults and their impact are the main focus of such historical ccounts, but Lowery shows clearly that students were charged with organizing and carrying out daily protests -- missing school to do so. Through her vivid recollections, Lowery deptly conveys the excitement, terror, hesitation, fear, and determination the students experienced.
The addition of both archived photos and illustrations help support the story well. TURNING 15 ON THE ROAD TO FREEDOM would be a great resource for any discussion of the civil rights movement or modern youth-led protests, including those in Ferguson, Missouri, New York City, and beyond. ","Parents need to know that Turning 15 on the Road to Freedom is the memoir of Lynda Blackmon Lowery, who s a young girl participated in the voting rights march of 1965 from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. It discusses the use of racial epithets and intimidation used against protesters during the march nd shows some historical violence against both children and adults, violence that has been well documented in the media and historical accounts. But here, readers get the rare perspective of a young schoolgirl. The publisher recommends this for kids age 12 and up, but the simple prose is easy to read, so it could be OK for younger readers. It's a great resource for conversations about social injustice in the United States.

Kira-Kira,"Girl faces racism, sister's cancer in touching tale.","When Katie is 5 years old, her family moves from Iowa to Georgia, where they become one of only 31 Japanese-Americans in town. Katie adores and admires her older sister, Lynn, who sees everything as kira-kira -- shining and glittering. Before Katie starts school, Lynn tells her that people may not want to talk to her because of her race, but Katie isn't really bothered by this. She's more interested in following her sister around and doing whatever she does, and, when her baby brother is born, taking care of him. Her parents both work in chicken-processing plants and are made to work inhumane hours -- for example, her mother has to wear a pad because she's not allowed to go to the bathroom -- but they withold support of a union out of fear of losing their jobs. Though Katie finds school boring, she finds joy elsewhere -- she loves camping with her uncle, looking at the stars with her sister, and playing with her little brother. When Lynn becomes very ill, she feels as if she's losing her whole family, as her parents must work extra long hours to pay medical bills, and Lynn no longer seems like Lynn. Ultimately, it falls to Katie to hold the family together.
","Historical fiction lovers will find an easy entry into KIRA-KIRA, as Katie's an immensely likeable narrator. She manages to remain optimistic about her future despite her family's struggles to stay afloat financially and, later, to get through her sister's illness. Her experiences as a Japanese-American girl living in the Deep South in the 1950s are fascinating and sometimes amusing (as when Katie talks about her Southern accent and her celebrity status as ""the little Japanese girl who said 'you all' instead of 'you'"") and touch on political and social issues without being heavy-handed. Readers not interested in history may find it rough going, however, since it sometimes seems as if nothing good ever happens to Katie, and the bad times accumulate, especially toward the end.","Parents need to know that Kira-Kira is a story about a poor Japanese-American family living in the South during the 1950s. Katie's sister becomes deathly ill with lymphoma, and it tears the family apart. The family encounters racism, although narrator Katie is matter-of-fact about it and only gradually realizes the limitations she'll face because of it. The only violence occurs when Katie's brother gets his ankle caught in an animal trap that a rich man put in his field to prevent trespassing. Katie's uncle chews and spits tobacco. There's one use of a drawled version of ""s--t."")

George and the Big Bang,Odd mix of cartoony space exploits and cutting-edge science.,"Distracted by having to find a new home for his pet pig and by his best friend Annie's sudden interest in a new boy, George is eager for an adventure of his own. When he uses Cosmos the supercomputer to follow Annie's father, Eric, to the Moon, he unwittingly creates an opportunity for Eric to be discredited and kidnapped by protesters who object to his work on the Large Hadron Collider. In trying to save Eric, George and his friends journey to a far-flung galaxy, to a strange house with an unguessable location, and to a booby-trapped underground lab.
","Like the Hawkings' previous George books, George's Secret Key to the Universe and George's Cosmic Treasure Hunt, this one presents a strange mix of fact and fiction. This book's short essays about the creation of the universe, string theory, quantum mechanics, dark matter, and gravity are sophisticated, yet comprehensible, at least to older readers with some background in science. The fast-paced sci-fi exploits of George and his friends are clever and fun but cartoonish, sometimes seeming to rely more upon magic than upon plausible science. It's hard to imagine how many readers will be satisfied with both modes of discourse, but George and the Big Bang manages to be both silly and profound.","Parents need to know that George and the Big Bang is an odd mix of goofy sci-fi adventures and nonfiction essays by famed British theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking and his author daughter, Lucy Hawking, that address the latest theories about time travel, quantum mechanics, and the origins of the universe. The youngest readers aren't likely to glean much from the mind-bending essays, while the older ones may find George's exploits too cartoony. Not much violence -- one kid subdues the villain with a single karate chop, and the threat of a bomb explosion hangs over the second half of the book.

"The Invaders: Brotherband Chronicles, Book 2",Teen shipmates take on pirates in high-seas series sequel.,"After losing the prized treasure of their Skandian town to the pirate Zavac and his men, Hal and his loyal crew, plus Hal's mentor, Thorn, cast off on the Heron to get it back, since they know they'd never be welcomed home empty handed. A very long storm forces the crew to set up camp in a secluded bay and wait. And wait. But the time doesn't go idly by: Hal constructs a makeshift wood shop and gets busy inventing a new and dangerous weapon to mount on his ship, and the seasoned Seawolf Thorn starts to train the boys in fighting so they'll stand a chance against Zavac. Just as the weather clears, Zavac and his men board a ship and torture the captain into telling him about treasure in neighboring Limmat. Which is just where the Heron will find them a-plundering. But when the Heron gets there, the town is completely overrun with pirates. They're going to need Hal's ingenious new weapon, a clever plan of attack, and lots more fighters.
","It's a long haul before the real action in THE INVADERS, but readers won't be bored. These boys are fun to be around, whether it's training hard on the beach with Thorn's curious methods or watching Hal invent in his shop.
After all the training in The Outcasts, now the Brotherband is officially on the move, ready for adventure ... and pirates. But wait -- a storm hits, and they're stuck in camp. For more than 100 pages.
Then the alliances form as everyone gets ready for battle against the pirates. Finally, there's a strong girl character, Lydia, in the mix. (She got a great introduction but could still use a bit more character development. Maybe in Book 3?) The climactic battle is worth the training, planning, and waiting. And Hal's big invention doesn't disappoint. It's going to be hard to wait for the Heron's next adventure.","Parents need to know that The Invaders is the second book in Brotherband Chronicles, the companion series to the popular Ranger's Apprentice series. There's more violence here than in Book 1, The Outcasts, because the seafaring teens are done with their official training and are facing real pirate enemies. But only two scenes stand out as being gory: one in which an unknown captain is tortured for information before being killed and another in which a more major character has an arrow removed from his side. Most other violence is battle-related and barely described. More central to the story are the growing skills and maturity of this underdog group of boys. Main character Hal continues to be a great model of leadership and ingenuity.

Will Eden go his own way, or will Daniel be able to curb his risky impulses?
","Sometimes a successful trilogy will accommodate a follow-up, and this engaging coda to a popular dystopian saga proves its worth. Author Marie Lu's tale of brothers in conflict isn't mandatory for her fans, but it's a smartly conceived action-adventure, perhaps a little muted compared with its predecessors.

"The Unwanteds, Book 1","Magical fantasy has peril, battles, positive messages.","Quill is a gray, oppressive world where -- on one day each year -- 13-year-olds are separated into three castes: Wanted, Necessaries, and Unwanted. Wanteds go to the Academy, Necessaries get to work, and the Unwanteds, mostly creative kids, are sent to the Death Farm to be thrown into a lake of boiling oil. Told from the point of view of one boy, Alex, marked Unwanted because he draws pictures in the mud, the story really begins when the Unwanteds arrive at the Death Farm and instead discover a place called Artime, which is very different from their terrible expectations. There, they meet Marcus Today, the magician-leader of Artime, who has created a world where each individual is valued and encouraged to grow. But it's not long before Alex and his fellow Unwanteds will have to use their creativity in a violent battle between the two societies.
","The beginning chapter is a bit shocking, though most kids, especially those who love touching the edges of terror, will find themselves pulled into the story immediately. The rest is filled with fast-paced action and magic, and kids who were labeled as ""Unwanted"" are empowered through their own talents. The writing is not complicated, which makes the story approachable for reluctant readers. More mature readers may wish the characters, societies, and plot points were a bit more developed. Overall, this is an entertaining read: the characters are likeable, the good guys win, and the message is a positive one. ","Parents need to know that this dystopian novel begins with a rather disturbing scene: frightened teens are sent to a death farm, thinking they will be exterminated in a lake of boiling oil. What follows is a fast-moving fantasy for kids, especially the more reluctant readers, who are not quite ready for Harry Potter, but are looking for an adventure -- and a little magic.  There is a very obvious good-vs.-evil storyline and readers get the message that creativity is essential to a thriving society.

The Great Gilly Hopkins,Brash foster-kid tale a great choice for reluctant readers.,"Gilly is one tough kid. She intends to destroy every one of her foster mothers so she can live with her mysterious real mother. She meets her match in Mrs. Trotter, an overweight, uneducated woman whose only weapon is total love for her foster kids. Can Gilly prevail against that?
","Katherine Paterson has created a believable character in Gilly, and readers learn how pain drives the bad behavior of this foster kid. Gilly ridicules Mrs. Trotter's deep religious faith and defies her at every turn, but she just can't escape the woman's relentless love. Readers will be satisfied with the ending, as Gilly resolves her issues and learns to love and be loved. A great choice for reluctant readers.","Parents need to know that Newbery Honor book The Great Gilly Hopkins, by Katherine Paterson (Bridge to Terabithia), is the story of a girl who's been in foster care all her life and is fixated on the notion that everything would be better if her mother, who abandoned her, would come back to her. She holds onto this idea, especially when she's placed with the quirky Trotter family, which she eventually sees as not so bad after all. Gilly's intent on being unpleasant -- she beats up boys and terrorizes her teachers and a series of foster parents -- will appeal to kids beginning to rebel against authority. Fresh and inventive writing keeps readers engrossed, making this a great choice for reluctant readers.

Bad Kitty for President,"Smart, savvy civics lesson served with lots of laughs.","In BAD KITTY FOR PRESIDENT, Kitty is fed up with stray cats coming into her neighborhood, so she decides to do something about it by running for president of the Neighborhood Cat Club. She tries to crown herself president but learns that it takes a lot of work to get elected. Still, she wins the primary (by kissing a baby) and becomes the nominee. Then she has to seek endorsements, hit the campaign trail, and figure out how to use mass media to her advantage. After a lively debate with her opponent, she and her fellow cats head to the polls on Election Day to find out who will lead the neighborhood cats for the next four years.
","Bad Kitty is expertly used here to humorously illustrate the best and worst of the American election process.
The idea of democratically electing a president is easy enough for a young child to understand -- but the actual mechanics of the process are much harder to grasp. Bad Kitty is certainly true to her moniker: She's selfish, devious, rude, and petty. (Insert your own joke about politicians here.)  Nick Bruel, author-illustrator of seven previous bad Kitty books, including A Bad Kitty Christmas, presents a nice piece of political humor built on the metaphorical race to lead the Neighborhood Cat Club. Kids will be so tickled by Kitty's antics -- she mistakes the idea of a ""grassroots campaign"" to mean she should use a lawn as a litter box, for example, and a video of her going ""nutso"" goes viral on ""VueTube"" -- that they'll sail through a complex discussion of American politics. Unlike more idealistic introductions to civics, this slim volume manages to equip kids with the know-how to be savvy participants in the democratic process. Bruel's winning illustrations add to the fun.","Parents need to know that despite a bit of coarseness, this latest in the New York Times-bestselling Bad Kitty series is a terrific primer on the election process. Kitty makes plenty of ugly missteps, including defecating on someone's lawn and smearing her opponent in an attack ad that she claims to know nothing about. Kids will get a healthy dose of skepticism along with their civics lesson.

A Light in the Attic,Poet delivers both a moral lesson and mischief.,"In light verse Shel Silverstein delivers both a moral lesson and mischief. Had everyone who ever read these poems followed their teachings, we would live in a funky, imagination-fevered world free of whiners, charlatans, spoiled brats, and losers.
 ","For many modern children, Shel Silverstein is their introduction to the joys of poetry. For decades he has tickled and enchanted generations of kids, and acted as a counterweight to the insipid poems they encounter in their basal readers. Silverstein looks at life from unexpected angles -- full of spirit and merriment and salad days. He sticks it to the naggers and the greedy and the lazy; their only recourse is to get a grip.
He gives voice to fears that are hard to express: ""Last night, while I lay thinking here, / Some Whatifs crawled inside my ear."" Said Whatifs quickly get to work: ""Whatif they start a war? / Whatif my parents get divorced? / Whatif the bus is late? / Whatif my teeth don't grow in straight? / Whatif I tear my pants? / Whatif I never learn to dance?"" The poems are complemented with Silverstein's expressive and innovative pen-and-ink illustrations.","Parents need to know that the playful language and light look at (sometimes serious) subject matter keep kids entertained.

Shiva's Fire,An introduction to India's complex social system.,"A girl is born during a cyclone. Surviving villagers blame the female infant for the death and destruction. As the girl grows, she is isolated until a great master of Indian classical dance recognizes her extraordinary talents. This lyrical story encourages readers to ask how and why some people are accepted into society and some are not.
 ","The slow and descriptive literary rhythm of this meditative story line captures mature readers. Suzanne Staples' main character, Parvati, faces young adulthood in a way that feels familiar to many young readers. Is friendship and love more important than self-realization? Must a girl make sacrifices to learn her art?
Staples is known for her meticulous research: She lived in India for four years and returned there to finish the book. Her stories are so dense and her descriptions so involving, some readers may give up -- but the author does provide a useful glossary. SHIVA'S FIRE is most gripping in its tense scenes of the cyclone destruction and of a tiger's attack. The author often builds drama in a way that unnerves the reader for many pages.","Parents need to know that the minute details introduce American readers to India's complex system of social levels.

There are magic frogs, evil stepsisters, talking animals, giants, elves, magical quests and terrible curses -- all the items young readers expect when they hear the name ""Grimm,"" plus beautifully rendered paintings and drawings that capture the action and mood splendidly.

For Darkness Shows the Stars,Riveting dystopian take on Jane Austen's Persuasion.,"In the dystopia of FOR DARKNESS SHOWS THE STARS, Elliot was born a Luddite, one of the privileged class of people who survived the Wars of the Lost and are allowed to own property and people. Her best friend has always been Kai, who was born to work for someone else. Kai decides to break free and follow his dream to become an explorer, and he invites Elliot to go with him. When she refuses because she feels responsible to the people who work on the land her family owns, Kai can't forgive her. Four years later, Kai returns, now a successful explorer; meanwhile, Elliot's father's farm is slowly sinking into ruin. Though Elliot still harbors deep feelings for her former friend, he seems interested only in showing her how well he's done. But the world around them is changing, and the new questions that arise about things they've always accepted as fact just may change them as well.
","Elliot is a richly developed character, and readers will sympathize with her difficult decision: being loyal to her family's workers or following the love of her life for new adventures.
Though the repetition of some of the concepts can get tiresome, and the language is occasionally imprecise, For Darkness Shows the Stars is a well-paced story that will keep readers quickly turning pages as more of the past is revealed and Elliot's dilemma becomes increasingly difficult. In an abundant field of dystopian YA literature, For Darkness Shows the Stars stands out because its underlying concepts are fascinating and relevant, and its characters are real and relatable.","Parents need to know that the dystopian world in For Darkness Shows the Stars is a feudal society in which the lords, called Luddites, for decades have eschewed technology and used mute, unintelligent people called the Reduced as their slaves. Questions about human rights and scientific progress influence many of the characters' life choices. The novel was inspired by Jane Austen's Persuasion, and readers of that classic will recognize many plot points (though not all: Most noticeably, the persuasion that drives Austen's Anne Elliot to make an important choice is absent here). But it's certainly not necessary to have read Persuasion to enjoy For Darkness Shows the Stars. As for sex and violence, prostitution and rape of the Reduced is alluded to but not discussed in graphic detail. Luddites are allowed to own guns, and at one point one character threatens another with a pistol.

This certainly is a book that encourages interaction. Not only will kids enjoy petting the horse's mane or pushing the tab to watch a chicken eat, but families who read this book together can also have fun picking out their favorite animals and even making their favorite barnyard sounds!","Parents need to know that this is an interactive book about farm animals by the same author and photographer who produced Tails.  Even your youngest will learn about the family of animals that live on the farm, and as they get older they can learn to pet, unfold pages, pull tabs, etc. The tabs may be a little tricky for the youngest fingers to manipulate -- although they might have some success ripping out fold-out pages.

Snow,Words and artwork create a magical winter wonderland.,"This book celebrates falling snow and the different kinds of feelings and moods it evokes. Primarily told through the eyes of a young girl and her grandmother, it begins with one tiny flake that becomes a full-fledged snowfall. Rather than being a story of their day, it's more a description of the different experiences people have of snow, how it falls, and how it changes the world. Snow might quietly fill the world at night, drift down enticingly outside the window during the day, whirl and swirl, drive people indoors, or call them outside to play. It stirs up a cheerful excitement, but also silences a noisy world. Most of all, it brings a comfortable, magical joy to the winter world.
","With a tone as delicate as the first tiny snowflake that begins to fall inside its front cover, this captures the joys of snowy days in its simple, beautiful text and icy blue-toned acrylic artwork. It's hard to describe how the words create such a magical tone, but somehow they do. Obviously they have been written by someone who knows what she is talking about. With a text that is gently poetic and touchingly genuine, Cynthia Rylant expresses what truly must be her love of snowy days and nights. And Lauren Stringer's snow-filled illustrations capture the tone perfectly. Peaceful scenes are quiet and cold, joyful scenes squeal with excitement, and cozy scenes couldn't be cozier.","Parents need to know that the words and pictures of this book celebrate the many moods of snow, from the first flake that swirls to the ground to the moment when snowdrifts have blanketed the entire world outside. Those who have lived in snow will recognize the different stages, and feelings. Those who have never had the experience will want to get acquainted.

When he arrives, he has one dog show him how to herd sheep and nother how to sniff out and dig for truffles, and he even learns to ride a bike to join the Tour de France when it blows through the town where he's staying.

Time Riders,Time-traveling thriller puts three teens in NYC on 9/11.,"Three teens are plucked from the edge of death and given the choice to become time riders, whose mission is to move back and forth in time, protecting the world from potential alterations by other time travelers. Liam was about to go down with the Titanic in 1912, Maddy was on an airplane that was about to be blown-up by a terrorist's bomb in 2010, and Sal was caught in a fire in Mumbai in 2026. Based on the premise that meddling with time can have disastrous results, their job is to keep a look out, find meddlers, and make sure that true history remains unchanged. Using a time bubble centered on the 9/11 attacks as their headquarters, they hide their identity as agents, and under the tutelage of an older time rider and Bob the robot, they begin an adventure that includes war, Nazis, carnage of all sorts, missed rendezvous, a doomsday machine, cannibalistic mutants, and some very hard choices.
 ","This book's idea is creative, the writing engaging, the adventures fast-paced, and the main characters seem like people you might like to know. On the other hand, some characters, like Kramer and his neo-Nazis, seem like comic book heroes, and there is more violence than necessary.
Many sci-fi time-traveling books deal with the idea that messing with time is a bad idea that usually makes things worse than they are. This book takes that one step further by creating an agency of time riders to make sure that does not happen.
In spite of all the high-tech talk about why things work and why they should be monitored, the story seems grounded in reality, and a complicated idea comes across clearly. Subheadings that give the time and place help the reader track the story threads, and intense moments sprinkled with philosophy and a bit of humor make this a very enjoyable and readable book. Most readers, especially sci-fi enthusiasts, will look forward to the other books in this series: Time Riders: Day of the Predators, Time Riders: The Doomsday Code, and Time Riders: The Eternal War. They may also enjoy the interactive missions offered on the Time Rider website.","Parents need to know that this fast-paced adventure takes the idea of time traveling to a different level, and is a hard book to put down. The first of four books (with more to follow), it centers on three time-riding agents whose mission is to save the world from the interference of other time-traveling manipulators. It does contain quite a bit of violence, and the three protagonists are endangered by evil characters and cannibalistic mutants. But overall, good triumphs over evil and the three protagonists grapple with some important issues and hard choices. The Time Rider website also offers interactive missions to play.

Moxie,Empowering story of girls standing up to sexual harassment.,"Viv Carter creates the first issue of MOXIE, her feminist zine, because she's had it with boys who have no hesitation about demeaning, touching, verbally tormenting, or sexually harassing the girls in her small-town high school. She distributes the first issue anonymously, and no one suspects that always-follows-the-rules Viv could be behind it. At first, only a few girls show their solidarity by drawing stars and hearts on their hands, but as Viv secretly distributes more issues around the school, more girls join in. They wear bathrobes to school to protest an unfairly applied dress code and slap ""You're an A--hole"" stickers on the cars, lockers, and backpacks of boys who've harassed girls. In the midst of all this, Viv begins a first romance with Seth, who supports the Moxie Girl movement (but not always strongly enough for Viv). But the more empowered the girls become, the more school administrators become determined to stop them. When a girl comes forward to accuse the principal of refusing to listen when she told him she'd been raped by a football player, the Moxie Girls decide it's time to risk it all by staging a walkout.
","Inspiring and insightful, this feminist coming-of-age story has a strong message of can-do empowerment for readers who feel helpless in the face of sexual harassment. Moxie should open the door to serious and honest discussions between teens (both girls and boys) and their parents about what constitutes sexual harassment and what can be done if that culture exists in their school.
There's lso a discussion to be had about how far the actions of a movement like the Moxie Girls can go in real life. While identifying harassers with stickers or staging a walkout work well in the novel, they might not be the most productive actions in all situations.","Parents need to know that Jennifer Mathieu's novel Moxie is set in a small-town Texas high school that has long tolerated boys sexually harassing and even assaulting their female classmates. Then one junior girl, Viv Carter, decides it has to stop -- that the girls need to fight back. She anonymously publishes a call-to-action feminist zine titled Moxie nd secretly distributes it around the school. Viv's campaign starts small, with girls identifying themselves as Moxie Girls by drawing hearts and stars on their hands. As the school year progresses, the number of Moxie Girls grows, and by the novel's end, they find themselves in a showdown with school officials. Boys are allowed to ""bump and grab"" girls in the hallways and hold a contest to find the ""Most F--kable"" girl in the junior or senior class. Profanity is used fairly regularly: ""f--k,"" ""d--k,"" ""bulls--t,"" ""hell,"" and ""a--hole."" This book can lead to serious discussions between parents and teens about sexual harassment.

Dial L for Loser: A Clique Novel,"Tween book is S for superficial, C for catty.","Having been expelled from Octavian Country Day School, the Pretty Committee members (Massie, Dylan, Alicia, Kristen, and newcomer Claire) are up to their elbows in shopping, hanging out, and talking about themselves. An opportunity arises to audition in L.A. for a part in a tween film that stars their favorite teen actors.
Surprisingly, Claire -- the least glamorous of the bunch -- beats out Massie and Alicia for the part. She develops movie friendships with two teen stars, aggravating the others even though they land roles reporting on the movie happenings for an early-morning news show.
Tricks, miscommunications, and back-stabbing put Claire right back where she started -- at the bottom of the clique heap -- though there's a hint of potential film career.
","There's no doubt that author Lisi Harrison, a writer for MTV, knows the female tween crowd -- what appeals, what's trendy, what's enticing. And clearly with the following of the Clique series, she's touched a nerve with this demographic.
But instead of creating a novel that helps girls see through the shallow world of cliques like the book's Pretty Committee, DIAL L FOR LOSERS perpetuates stereotypes of kids, specifically girls, being malicious, gossipy, jealous, materialistic, and unable to learn from experiences in a way that shows maturation and taking responsibility for yourself. While the ""nerdy"" (and most sympathetic) character does appear to get a taste of popularity and learn something about herself, the others are as self-involved at the end of the book as they were in the beginning.","Parents need to know that this novel is the sixth in a series about wealthy, privileged girls who are obsessed with material items, boys, and themselves. This book continues the degradation of the ""new"" girl, a middle-class ""nerd"" desperate to fit in. Most of the dialogue is about purchasing of designer labels, finding ways to ""lip-kiss"" boys, or scheming to bring another kid down.

"Undying: Unearthed, Book 2",Alien-invasion sequel earthbound but still action-packed.,"Picking up where the first volume left off, UNDYING continues the adventures of Mia and Jules as they frantically try to stop an alien invasion of Earth. Having uncovered the secrets of a giant spacecraft, they stowaway on a shuttle bound for their home planet, accompanied by two of the Undying, Dex and Atlanta. They crashland in Europe and are taken into custody by agents of the International Alliance. No one believes Mia and Jules, though, insisting the invasion to be a hoax. Jules and Mia must escape and find absolute proof that Earth is about to be taken over by hostile extraterrestrials.
","Moving from the marvelous to the mundane can be jarring, and this mostly earthbound follow-up to a high-flying adventure in space may slightly disappoint faithful readers. Authors Amie Kaufman and Meagan Spooner make their lead characters Jules and Mia as adorable as ever, but running around Europe isn't quite as interesting as exploring an ancient, puzzle-filled, alien spacecraft. There's still plenty of crisp, quirky dialogue, and the action never flags, which may be enough for readers seeking a new spin on alien invasions.","Parents need to know that Undying is the second half of the science-fiction adventure begun in Unearthed, from the writing team of Amie Kaufman nd Meagan Spooner. Main characters Mia and Jules work to stop and fight an alien invasion, but since they've crashlanded in Europe, they're working on it from there, not outerspace.

Peter Pan in Scarlet,Official Peter Pan sequel doesn't soar.,"Some 20 years have passed since the events chronicled in Peter Pan. The Lost Boys have grown up, little Michael has been killed in WWI, and the rest have careers and families. But dreams are leaking out of the Neverland, disturbing their sleep, and leaving all-too-real souvenirs. Gathering together with Wendy, they decide they must become children again and fly back to Neverland to find out what's wrong.
Once there they discover a land that is deteriorating, but they forget their mission. Finding the derelict ""Jolly Roger"" and a treasure map on board, they join Peter on an expedition to find Hook's treasure. They are joined by the mysterious Ravello, a circus-master, who becomes Peter's butler. But in Neverland, adults can only mean trouble.
","McCaughrean has sucked out the joy, the effervescent spirit, the humor -- everything that made Peter Pan a classic -- and produced a plodding slog of a story. The original may have been dark, but it was never dreary; it was woven of dreams and fairy dust. But here a scene involving quicksand is all too emblematic.
The journey to and up the Neverpeak alone is so tedious and sprawling, not to mention grinding and miserable, that many readers who have hung in that far will drop out. Now Peter seems like a crabby old man who grumbles about pains in his joints. This joyless, forced march badly needs an infusion of happy thoughts.","Parents need to know that several characters nearly die but don't, and there I's a lot of threatened violence -- though little actually occurs.

Melody reminisces about her childhood and takes us up to fifth grade, when she acquires a machine that helps her communicate better than she ever could before. When she gets on a school team with the ""regular"" kids that finally allows her to show off her intelligence, Melody thinks she's on the road to being accepted by them -- until she learns the heartbreaking truth that her differences will always set her apart.

With the help of her parents and some supportive friends and teachers, Melody acquires a machine that allows her to communicate better than she ever has before.

But as summer begins, there's trouble ahead: Lucy's family is moving to the other side of the country, and instead of spending the summer with Lucy at camp, Ashley's stuck at home taking care of relentlessly cheery Claire, a 7-year-old whose late mom was a friend of Ashley's mother. Also, she's accidentally discovered a mysterious jar filled with scraps of paper, each of which propels her to the past and the adventures of two girls her own age.
 ","Middle-grade girls will find it easy to relate to Ashley and the situations she finds herself in.

And, of course, time travel and the ability to see life in the past up close and personal.

They are becoming cliquish and a bit too obsessed with piercing their ears and shopping. Cinderella doesn't fit in with them like she used to, and she is not sure what to do about it. When she gets the lead in the dance recital, things look a bit rosier ... that is until she loses yet another shoe, this time her new red tap shoe.

Though not all the loose ends are connected, there is nothing objectionable or particularly complicated about the story, and it would be a good chapter book for younger school-age readers. A sequel will be published in April 2012. ",9,,8,Stephanie Barden,Coming of Age,Great Girl Role Models,Fiction,Harper,"April 26, 2011",8 - 12,148,,"July 13, 2017",Diane Goode,,,,,
Curses! Foiled Again,Teen girl defends Faerie in lively graphic novel sequel.,"Recently appointed as the Defender of Faerie, high school fencing whiz Aliera Carstairs must learn to walk the border between the magical and the mundane. She is hampered by the presence of Avery Castle, an annoying troll-boy who has sworn allegiance to her. When Aliera's aunt is attacked and her wheelchair-using cousin, Caroline, disappears, Aliera must journey back to Faerie to rescue her.
","This is an engaging new volume in the fantasy graphic novel series begun with Foiled. Aliera Carstairs is a well-designed protagonist: capable yet not overconfident, caring but with an edge. Her adventures in contemporary suburbia and Faerie are both exciting and well observed. Mike Cavallaro's artwork is expressive and clear in its storytelling, with a nice use of color to distinguish the magical aspects of the tale. Although Curses! feels much like a middle volume in a series, it has sufficient plot development and reversals to satisfy return readers and new ones alike.","Parents need to know that Curses! Foiled Again continues the adventures of Aliera Carstairs, Defender of the Seelie Court, begun in Foiled. Celtic and other folklore is used as a springboard for a charming contemporary fantasy that features magic and swordplay. The violence is generally cartoonish, with no human fatalities. The language is unlikely to offend anyone, and there's only the vaguest hint of romance between any of the teen characters.

"The Nixie's Song: Beyond the Spiderwick Chronicles, Book 1",Spiderwick series continues with new characters.,"With his mother dead, Nick is none too happy when his father remarries and he has to give up his bedroom to his new stepsister, Laurie. He's even less happy to find that she's a weirdo who believes in the fairies and the unseen magical world she has read about in The Spiderwick Chronicles. But he's really unhappy to discover that she's right.
","This doesn't have the freshness and exciting suspense of the original series, and Nick and Laurie are rather unlikable protagonists. It does have one bit that long-time fans will enjoy, though: an appearance in the story by the author, illustrator, and the twins on whom the series is supposedly based. Nick and Laurie go to see them at a book signing, hoping for some advice in dealing with a problem with a giant, and are vastly disappointed. The author has fun razzing herself and her partner, and it provides a little metafiction interlude that jazzes the proceedings up for a while. But in the next book the basic story will have to pick up considerably, and Nick and Laurie will have to become a whole lot more appealing, to hold onto fans of the original series.
This is the beginning of a new series spun off The Spiderwick Chronicles. The characters are new, the setting changed to Florida, but the concept is the same: we are surrounded by an unseen, mostly malevolent, world of magical creatures, and certain magical items (here a four-leaf clover and the water a nixie has swum in) can give one the Sight to see it.","Parents need to know that there's a bit of violence at the end, but otherwise this is pretty mild, milder than the original Spiderwick series, and not too scary or suspenseful.

"The Final Warning: Maximum Ride: The Protectors, Book 1",Uninspired sci-fi adventure won't leave kids wanting more.,"Max and the flock go to Antarctica to try to stop global warming in some unspecified way. While there robots sent by the evil Uber-Director capture them and take them to Miami to be auctioned to the highest bidder, right in the middle of a hurricane caused by -- you guessed it! Global warming.
","If this is the best Patterson can do, it's past time for this series to end. All books are written to make money, and there's nothing wrong with that -- authors and publishers have livings to make, just like anyone else -- but usually, absent true artistic inspiration, an effort is made at least to disguise that crass reality. Not here -- and it's painful to watch the author struggling to fill up the pages when he is out of ideas. Nine chapters of Angel wandering off to pet a penguin and getting stuck in a crevasse. Interspersed chapters of Fang responding to inane postings on his website (there's a reason nobody's rushing to publish books of blog comments). Most of the book is about traveling to Antarctica for no discernible reason. Periodically one of the flock randomly develops a new power which is then not used at all in the plot. Gazzy can now fart a noxious green cloud -- how's that for pandering? Reading this one might reasonably assume that the author doesn't have much respect for his audience's intelligence.
	Patterson clearly has nothing left to say, at least about these characters, and is just cynically cranking out books because he knows fans of the series, which at least used to be fun, will buy them anyway. Making it worse is that he has a lot to say about global warming, all of it trite, didactic, and obvious (Evil Corporations! Pollution is bad! We'd better do something soon!). The scene in which Max testifies before a Congressional Committee about global warming, because she has, you know, been to Antarctica, so she's an expert, is so ludicrous that at least you might get a chuckle out of it, especially when she dramatically tosses aside her notes to speak from the heart and awes the crowd (now where have you seen that before?).
 From the Book:
	Okay, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that funerals suck. Even if you didn't know the person, it's still totally sad. When you did know the person, well, let's just say it's much worse than broken ribs. And when you just found out that the person was your biological half brother, right before he died, it adds a whole new level of pain.
	Ari. My half brother. We shared the same ""father,"" Jeb Batchelder, and you can believe those quotes around ""father.""","Parents need to know that there is a bit of violence here, but not nearly as much as in previous books in the series.

The Nonsense Show,"Bright, silly scenes of world turned upside down.","THE NONSENSE SHOW is framed as a circus sideshow. It opens with a rabbit pulling a boy out of a hat, with text that reads ""Welcome friends! Don't be slow. Step right up to The Nonsense Show!"" The pages that follow each feature some rhyming text and a silly scene that upends our expectations -- for instance, a snake with two heads or a man in a doghouse. At the end of the book, the boy who was pulled out of the hat gleefully pushes the rabbit offstage, with a cascade of words in a speech balloon emphasizing the nonsense: ""preposterous, poppycock, baloney, hogwash."" The rabbit holds his arms out in triumph, shouting ""THE END!""
","This whimsical book, which bills itself as an homage to surrealism, will appeal to young readers as pure nonsensical fun. A mouse chases a cat, a kangaroo has a kid in his pouch, a bird in a fish tank talks to a fish in a bird cage. The spirit isn't that much of a departure from vintage Carle, in which a hungry caterpillar eats salami, a pickle, and chocolate cake.
Kids will have fun spotting characters similar to ones in other beloved Carle books. That kangaroo looks familiar -- though this time he has a boy popping out of his pouch. And the moon? Straight out of Papa, Please Get the Moon for Me, another book with a fanciful premise. Here, some jokes are funnier than others, and the rhyme's occasionally choppy. But Carle's signature bold, bright art is catnip for the youngest readers, who're still piecing together the world nd therefore very happy to be in on the joke that something doesn't make sense.","Parents need to know that The Nonsense Show is Eric Carle (The Very Hungry Caterpillar) at his silliest. The dedication page mentions French artist René Magritte, and Carle says the book is his homage to surrealism, but it's as much Monty Python as Magritte, a sideshow of nonsensical visual jokes:  jungle cat sporting both tiger stripes and leopard spots, and a lion taming a pair of humans on circus pedestals. Each spread has rhyming text that points readers to the element that's nonsense, though the rhyme doesn't flow from one spread to the next; each can be taken as a separate episode, as if Carle were illustrating a volume of Shel Silverstein's poems. Some of the most successful spreads feature animals, which kids love nd which Carle renders with characteristic color nd appeal.

The only trouble is, she won't go to sleep, and her ""Peep, peep, peep!"" is keeping everyone else on the farm wake and exhausted. So Duck finally gets Baby Duck to fall asleep by driving her back and forth in the tractor, ccidentally crashing though the farmer's fence in the process.

Touching Snow,"Vivid, violent child abuse story sure to leave mark.","Karina lives in New York in the 1980s, but her family comes from Haiti where she says adults often use corporal punishment on their kids. But her stepfather's beatings are extreme -- one beating left Karina with head trauma that causes her to have fainting spells. When her stepfather nearly kills her older sister Enid, someone anonymously turns him in. But Karina's mother and relatives pressure her to cover up the truth from social workers and even a judge, because they need him to help pay the bills. Her mother says she won't let her stepfather beat them anymore, but what will happen when he comes home?
","There are some complicated ideas here that require a sophisticated reader. For example, after Karina murders her stepfather, her life -- and the lives of her family members -- is greatly improved, and she suffers no guilt or consequences because of his death. Also, the author touches on some culturally sensitive issues around parenting and discipline that parents may want to help their teens sort through. Even so, this is a vivid and powerful novel that readers will remember. Karina is a very real narrator, made so believable by the casual way she drops in details about her horrific situation, like that you have to ""try and stand still when a belt is coming at you.""","Parents need to know that this National Book Award finalist features horrifying child abuse, and a girl admits right in the beginning that she killed her stepfather before revealing the story of what he did to her family. There is some drinking and swearing, a bulimic character, and Karina and her female friend kiss, sleep in the same bed, and look at pornography together -- but it's really the images of the abuse that mark this book for mature readers. It's a moving story with a hopeful ending as the abused sisters realize they are ""guardian angels for one another"" and they are going to work to protect each other and the other people they care about.

The Great American Whatever,"Wry, heartfelt tale of teen trying to move on after tragedy.","Quinn Roberts is 16 going on 17, and he's trying not to think about anything at all. Since the death of his older sister -- who also happened to be his best friend and filmmaking partner -- he's stopped going to school, writing his screenplays, showering, or even leaving the home he shares with his mother, who's similarly frozen with grief. When his best friend, Geoff, drags him out to a college party, he meets Amir, an older (and very cute) college student whose flirtatious interest coaxes Quinn out of hiding. Quinn knows how he'd like this story to play out, but he finds that reality tends to stray from his script.
","Author Tim Federle has a gift for blending witty humor with pathos to create charming antiheroes, and he brings it all to this touching story about coming out to live life fully and unapologetically. Tragedy pulses through THE GREAT AMERICAN WHATEVER, but it's kept in check by Quinn's irrepressible spirit. He's an observant and self-deprecating narrator, able to laugh at his own insecurities. As his idealized heroes are revealed as flawed -- and more human -- Quinn's faith in himself grows ever stronger.
Some readers may find the sexual content awkward or too edgy, but for most teens Quinn's anxiety over sex and relationships will strike a very familiar chord. It's a classic coming-of-age tale with a very modern sensibility: Quinn is nervous about coming out, but the big reveal proves to be no big deal. His relationship with Amir isn't a love affair for the ages, but it's no less consequential for a boy figuring out how to be his own man.","Parents need to know that The Great American Whatever is a coming-of-age story about a gay teen struggling with grief and guilt after his sister's death. Author Tim Federle previously has written gay-friendly books for tweens (Better Nate Than Ever), but this book is for an older audience: It has mature themes and sexual content and language (references to ""boners"" and ""getting laid""; some casual swearing, including ""s--t"" and ""f—k""). Quinn, who's trying to avoid wrestling with his feelings and adjusting to a future without his sister, seeks out new, distracting experiences -- such as drinking beer and considering smoking pot and engaging in serious flirting with an older, experienced man. He's embarrassed by his virginity and wants to have a sexual relationship.

The Extraordinary Adventures of Alfred Kropp,Likable loser tries to save world in action-packed novel.,"Oversized, clumsy, luckless, untalented, unmotivated, slow-witted Alfred has not had it easy. His father disappeared when he was a baby, his mother died of cancer, and his guardian, Uncle Farrell, is a night watchman with big dreams and a small mind. When Farrell forces him to help steal a valuable sword, neither of them know that it is Excalibur, the most powerful weapon on earth -- or that their employer plans to use it to rule the world. Swept up into a world of international intrigue that combines black ops agents in attack helicopters with medieval knights who fight with swords but drive Ferraris and motorcycles, Alfred stumbles forward trying to fix what he has messed up, only to see nearly everyone around him get killed. But there are secrets within secrets, including why Alfred is involved in this at all.
","Though well-written, this book doesn't withstand literary, or even logical, scrutiny. There's been an interesting trend in kids' books in the last few years toward stories that are the literary equivalent of The Terminator movies -- well-made, cinematic, edgy, violent action-adventure thrillers that are just pure, ridiculous fun. This book is one of those. But that doesn't matter, because the story carries the reader along so rapidly, and with so much satisfaction and pleasure, that harping on its flaws seems positively curmudgeonly. This ain't made for English class; it's made to remind young teen boys how much fun reading can be -- and it does so admirably.
From its terrific opening hook to its obviously-this-is-going-to-be-a-series ending, this has what many young readers are looking for: a mystery, a bit of fantasy, humor, nonstop action, violence edgy enough to be cool and bug your parents, a nice array of weapons, cars, and planes, and, of course, a likable orphaned loser as the protagonist. Only at the climax does the author lose focus for an instant, making the resolution a bit fuzzy. Otherwise, this is high-quality escapism -- let's hope more is on the way.","Parents need to know that there is a lot of rather extreme violence referred to in this fantasy adventure. Though not graphically described, there are many deaths by beheadings, a throat stabbing, and a disembowelment -- plus weapons and explosions. In addition, names of fast food restaurants, sodas, cars, and clothing labels are mentioned. But Alfred is a loveable loser who makes a pretty major mistake -- but then does work hard to correct his error (and, you know, save the world along the way). This could be a good choice for reluctant readers: This ain't made for English class, but rather to remind young teen boys how much fun reading can be -- and it does so admirably.

Dark Night,"Darkly comic, empowering take on tackling nighttime fears.","Little Felix is walking, alone and scared, in a forest at night when he hears a terrifying noise. He hides in a hollow tree as a wolf arrives and starts a fire. This is bad -- but then it gets worse. The wolf is scared away by a tiger, and then the tiger is frightened off by a crocodile. Terrified Felix finds his way into the cozy kitchen of a smart rabbit who offers to help him return safely home with the aid of a fearsome disguise.
","Dorothee de Monfreid, the French illustrator of I’d Really Like to Eat a Child, serves up another slightly subversive tale. This one is about confronting fear: Holding hands with a good friend, reasoning with the animals, and tricks of the mind won’t solve Felix’s problem -- those are wild beasts, after all! There’s no way around it: He will have to turn the tables on those frightening creatures, with bravery and a clever ruse.Kids will be gratified to see Felix and the little rabbit prove themselves bigger and scarier than the intimidating beasts. Felix, clad in cheerful red pajamas, is an endearing young hero. Some kids might be a bit nervous as the story begins, but they’ll laugh at the sight of the formerly fierce animals quivering behind trees as costumed Felix makes his way home. The sky lightens to bright pink, banishing the dark night, and Felix and the rabbit celebrate with a hot chocolate toast. Cheers, indeed!
The mood is a bit surreal and spooky, but the cartoonish illustrations provide warmth and comic relief.","Parents need to know this sly book is quite dark at the beginning -- the young, quaking hero seems to be in a tough spot. But the rest of the story will ease any jitters and get kids giggling as fears are conquered. There’s not much of concern here -- just some sharp-toothed creatures and dark shadows.

He's worried about his older brother, Rowan, who hasn't been heard from for weeks.

The Dog Who Lost His Bark,Abused puppy learns to trust in perfect boy-and-dog tale.,"Born in a puppy mill to a loving mom who can only protect him with good advice, then sold to an abusive family who eventually dump him with the garbage, THE DOG WHO LOST HIS BARK is shut down and determined to never trust another human. Then Patrick, who's wanted a dog all his life, goes to the shelter and decides he's the one. Dubbed Oz because he has an Australia-shaped spot, and because Patrick's fiddler father is on a seemingly endless tour there, the puppy is determined not to be fooled by human tricks again. But Patrick is patient (even when Oz poops in his shoes). When Oz starts howling along to Patrick's violin from Beethoven to Star Wars, it's a breakthrough. But there's still a lot of stuff ahead for these two.

Against all this, young Patrick, his mom, and his grandfather show a lot of heart, wisdom, patience, and creativity in helping puppy Oz learn to trust and enjoy life -- often through the healing power of music.

Brief Chronicle of Another Stupid Heartbreak,Uneven take on summer breakups and teen love.,"In BRIEF CHRONICLE OF ANOTHER STUPID HEARTBREAK, a teen girl flounders after a breakup and spends most of her summer avoiding a writing deadline and obsessing over the nature of love. Lu's boyfriend breaks up with her at the start of summer, crushing her notion of the two having a few wonderful, carefree months together and possibly a long-distance relationship when they start at different colleges in the fall. As for college, she's received a scholarship to NYU that's tied to a writing gig she has with a hip online teen magazine. The column is about love and relationships, and the breakup spurs writer's block of epic proportions. She's at risk of losing her column and her scholarship if she doesn't get something -- anything -- written soon. She happens upon another teen couple on the verge of a summer breakup and decides she wants to write about them. But still, the words don't come. She's convinced that these new friends have the answers to love and relationships she's hungry to learn, but in spending so much time with them, she blows off her boss, her mom, and her best friend. Lu is emotionally stuck in so many ways and needs to figure out how to dig herself out of the mess she's created.
","This tale of teen summer breakups is equal parts frustrating and endearing. In Brief Chronicle of Another Stupid Heartbreak, author Adi Alsaid accurately captures the highs and lows of that unique summer between high school and college. Teens that age are technically adults, but they have one foot in the world of independence and the other still accountable to parents. The characters' musings on love, and teen love in particular, are interesting and engaging. The intelligence and kindness of the secondary characters add a certain sweetness to the story. Lu is awkward and sarcastic, which is sometimes relatable, but throughout most of the book she is so self-absorbed, in denial, and clueless that she ends up not being a sympathetic main character.
Writer's block and shirking aren't compelling story topics, and Alsaid doesn't do a great job of making them so. The story is told in first person with Lu as narrator, and her head's not a fun place to be, making a too long book feel endless when she's not moving forward with anything in her life. The repetitive thoughts and conversations become tiresome. There are sections of the book that are funny and charming, but the slow place and frustrating main character bog down the narrative.","Parents need to know that Brief Chronicle of Another Stupid Heartbreak by Adi Alsaid (Let's Get Lost, Never Always Sometimes) is about a teen girl, Lu, reeling after a post-graduation breakup and trying to figure out whether teen love is ""real"" love. The breakup has led to a case of writer's block, which has serious consequences, because her scholarship to NYU is tied to her regularly writing a relationship column for a magazine. She procrastinates all summer, while hanging out with two new friends she considers to be the perfect teen couple. The book depicts 18-year-old high school graduates wandering in New York City, thinking about their futures, going to parties, missing curfews, and talking about love and relationships. Love is a central theme of the book. Characters kiss, touch, and make out, but nothing too steamy is shown. There's lots of strong language, including ""s--t,"" ""f--k,"" and ""a--hole."" Some of the characters get drunk a few times, and it is portrayed as fun and funny. The story provides good discussion points around trust, love, and what it takes to make any kind of relationship -- love, family, friendship -- work.

All the Greys on Greene Street,Girl copes with mom's depression in colorful '80s mystery.,"In ALL THE GREYS ON GREENE STREET, set in gritty SoHo in 1981, Olympia (also known as Ollie) is the only kid living on her New York City block. Most of the buildings are abandoned factories -- with a few artist lofts like her own sprinkled among them. Her best friends, Richard and Alex, live within a few blocks of her, and they walk to school together, go the park, hang out in Olympia's dad's studio, or work on Richard's journal of monsters. What Olympia does the most is draw in her notebook. Ollie's parents are artists, and they live, breathe, talk, walk art. But her dad has disappeared under a cloud of mystery, and her mom has taken to her bed and isn't responding to Olympia's pleas to get up and start working again. Ollie is convinced that if she solves the mystery surrounding her dad's disappearance, he'll come home. But what will she do if she can't put the pieces together in time? How can she ask for help when she thinks she's betraying her parents? ","Rich in detail and aching with sadness, this story unravels what it means to live among artists who see art in everything. All the Greys on Greene Street, Laura Tucker's debut, invites readers to step into another place and time, when New York was dirty, the punk women at the adult parties wore silver combat boots, street artists jumped fences to paste up posters, and artist lofts in SoHo were a new idea. Kids with an artistic eye or urban tastes will enjoy this honest rendering. The sounds of the trucks outside of the window unloading their wares, the slurping of noodles at a favorite restaurant in Chinatown, the colors springing to life in the studio's mixing palette are vividly and memorably rendered. However, for a book claiming to be a mystery, the mystery reads like a side note. It can't really compete with the throb of the city and the emotional riptide dragging Olympia's mother deeper into depression. The reactions that the characters have to the mysterious disappearance are more compelling than the mystery itself. Like the description of a city kid being taken outside of the urban core for the first time; it's riveting to get a glimpse of a boat ride through Olympia's eyes, and to feel her fall asleep in a room that is really, truly quiet. At its core, this book is a trip through the lens of an artist. Its appeal to ask for help when things are too overwhelming is on point. Though it seems to end a bit too conveniently, the destination is worth the ride.","Parents need to know that All the Greys on Greene Street is a mystery that deals with parents' separation and a mother's descent into depression. Olympia, the 12-year-old main character, describes a tween's-eye view of neglect and abandonment. She doesn't know where her meals are going to come from, and whether her artist dad will come home, or when her mom will finally get out of bed. The year is 1981, and the story takes place in downtown New York City, where Olympia's mom sends her to buy cigarettes at the local bodega. Olympia's friend's mother is always on a diet, which affects the kids because the food in the house changes with her diet whims. Adults drink casually but keep a careful eye on the kids, for the most part. The book includes spot pencil illustrations by Kelly Murphy.

He is just trying to serve his middle school sentence and move on. On his first day, his first encounter with another student is with Miller the Killer, the class bully. Rafe’s plan to try to ""keep [his] head down, try to blend in, and don’t get on anyone’s bad side"" doesn’t work, and Miller makes him his target. During the school assembly, Rafe gets the idea to systematically break every rule in the Hills Village Middle School Code of Conduct. He and his best and only friend, Leo the Silent, create a reality-show game with points and exciting twists. Rafe’s unusual friendship with Leo will surprise most readers.
","This irreverent story pokes fun at everything about middle school while creating a fresh, indelible character in Rafe. The wonderful cartoon illustrations by Laura Park (ostensibly done by Rafe's friend Leo) will attract Diary of a Wimpy Kid fans, but these detailed drawings also reveal much about Rafe’s character and how he views the world. Teachers and parents might be offended by the harshness and irreverence with which Rafe portrays Hills Village Middle School, but kids who feel as trapped and alone as he does will relate. Rafe sees himself as a geek, but readers will see his other side -- a sweet boy trying to do what's right.
 ","Parents need to know that Middle School, the Worst Years of My Life, by James Patterson and Chris Tebbetts and illustrated by Laura Park, tells the story of Rafe, a kid who sets out to break all the school rules and is disrespectful to teachers and staff. The humorous drawings poke fun at teachers and just about everyone else at Hills Village Middle School. And Rafe suffers bullying at school and at home.

Obsidian Mirror,Complex time travel page-turner starts sci-fi trilogy.,"Jake can't take a minute more of boarding school. He knows his father has been murdered and that his best friend and godfather Oberon Venn is to blame. Injuring a student gets him gratefully expelled and on a plane back to England to confront the recluse Venn, unfortunately with his teacher Mr. Wharton as chaperone. When Jake and Wharton arrive at the remote and ancient Wintercombe Abbey, Wharton is reluctant to leave Jake there. Venn is short-tempered and distant and has taken in a teen girl named Sarah, who claims to have escaped a mental institution. And hidden in a locked room: the Obsidian Mirror, Venn's obsession. Jake's father is lost in time thanks to the mirror, an artifact of ominous origins Venn is desperately trying to use to get his deceased wife back. And Sarah has agreed to risk her life to help. She's as desperate as Venn is to get close to the mirror -- for her own mysterious reasons.
","Here's a time-twisting tale without a minute wasted on long exposition. OBSIDIAN MIRROR not only keeps readers guessing about just about everything (Who's Sarah really? And Piers? Why do you need a special bracelet to enter the mirror? How is that journal answering Sarah? How did Jake get a letter from his dad?), it also weaves together such curious elements that, at first, you think there's no way they'll ever meld into one story. But they do. Eventually. And sometimes at a much deeper level: What is the nature of time, really? What if it didn't really exist, like in the land of Lady Summer?
	If those questions are beyond readers, it's no matter. The story moves much faster than you can chew over it, through time, through another world, and through the characters' revealed deep, dark secrets. Readers are swept back and forth, forward and back, every few pages. Then, Obsidian Mirror lets you close the book and ponder exactly where it's taken you on your own time.","Parents need to know that Obsidian Mirror is the start of a new time-travel series by Catherine Fisher, the popular author of the Incarceron series. As in Incarceron, the themes here are complex (nothing more mind-bending than the idea of time travel), but the violence is milder. There are mentions of a dystopian world in the future, but most of the action takes place in the present day, where a wolf attacks and there are gunshots and a stabbing. A trip back to Victorian London brings about a mention of prostitutes and a walk through an opium den. At the center of the story, both teen Jake and his godfather Venn deal with the loss of loved ones and will use any dangerous means to get them back. The strongest language is  ""hell.""

Incantation,Young teens may find powerful Inquisition book too violent.,"Estrella lives a comfortable life as a Catholic in Spain around 1500, the era of the Inquisition. She and her best friend, Catalina, are as close as can be, her brother is studying to be a priest, and her grandfather is a respected teacher. The anti-Jewish riots that sweep through her town barely touch her life at all. But then two events change everything. She discovers that her family are Marranos, Jews who pretend to be Christians while secretly holding on to their faith. And she falls in love with Catalina's cousin, Andres, which turns Catalina against her. In 1500s Spain, Catalina has an easy weapon for revenge, and she doesn't hesitate to use it. But even she is shocked by the life-destroying results.
","This book is not long, and the reading level is accessible to 10-year-olds, but the author does not flinch from matter-of-factly depicting the hate-filled violence of which humans are capable. There are parents who believe children should face the horrors of the world head-on, and those who believe children should be shielded from them; if you are the second type, you do not want your children to read this book. As her family is rounded up by the Inquisition, Estrella witnesses torments that are almost be beyond belief. In our era of growing worldwide religious tension, this book reminds us of the extremes to which religious intolerance and hatred can so easily lead. But that doesn't make it any easier to read.","Parents need to know that this book doesn't flinch from the excesses of the Inquisition era. It describes grisly, gruesome violence against men and women, young and old. But through this powerful story, teens learn about an important time in history and may be inspired to think about and discuss the cost of religious intolerance and hatred. Readers will appreciate Estrella's discovery of who she really is, her fight for survival, and her instructions that others not forget her story.

I Lost My Bear,Text and pictures work together perfectly.,"Oh, no! A little girl's favorite stuffed toy is GONE! Her parents won't help, but her sister thinks she should throw another toy and see if it finds the first one. But which to pick? And how to avoid hurting any of the toys' feelings? The always hilarious Feiffer captures the inner workings of a preschooler's mind with impressive perception.
 ","Jules Feiffer's seamless blend of scribbled text and cartoon art captures every nuance of the young heroine's feelings. The reader stays in complete sympathy with the little girl even when she's pouting. Adults can expect their kids to squeal with delight at the girl's all-too-recognizable antics.
Rarely do text and pictures work together this perfectly. But in the hands of a master the tiniest curlicue carries a tremendous freight of character, hilarity, and poignancy. It's a good thing this book is so much fun for adults, because their children will want to hear it again and again. And while kids point and laugh at the little girl's ever-changing expressions and the havoc she makes of the house, parents and grandparents will smile in recognition of Feiffer's wise insights into young children.","Parents need to know that comic-style pictures and uproarious text keep kids interested.

Masterpiece,"Brilliant, suspenseful, satisfying art mystery.","James is a quiet boy living with, and mostly ignored by, his divorced, social-climbing mother and stepfather. Marvin is a beetle living with his supportive, if perhaps overwhelming, family behind the kitchen sink. When James' artist father gives him a pen-and-ink set, Marvin -- who can understand but not speak English -- discovers a talent for art, and makes a tiny, detailed drawing for James, which everyone assumes James did. As they become friends, his drawing brings James to the attention of a curator at the Met, who enlists his aid in catching an art thief -- but James can only do it with Marvin's help.
","In the small subgenre of art mysteries for children, author Elise Borach has produced one of the best yet. Take the miniature world elements of The Borrowers, the art mystery of Chasing Vermeer, and the human-bug friendship of The Cricket in Times Square add in suspense, philosophy, and art history, and you get this exceptionally appealing, satisfying page-turner. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this multifaceted story is the way the interspecies friendship improves and enlarges the lives of both friends, boy and beetle. Marvin expands his horizons and becomes braver and more forceful. James improves his relationship with both of his parents. Though the resolution of the issue of everyone thinking James is an artist seems a little odd, the rest of the book is fast-moving, thought-provoking, and delightful.","Parents need to know that there is a scene where a boy gets his hand crushed under a car trunk lid, possibly on purpose, though this is never clear. Otherwise there is little of concern, and some good conversation about friendship, art, and philosophy.

The Center of Everything,"Sweet, funny story of girl recovering from grandma's death.","Ruby's always done what she's supposed to do. Calm and competent, everyone relies on her not to be any trouble. But when her grandma Gigi dies, Ruby can't seem to get back on track even weeks after everyone else seems to have moved on. When she's chosen to be the Essay Girl at Bunning Day, the town's annual holiday to celebrate the inventor of donuts, she places all her faith in a wish made on a quarter tossed though a bronze donut. This, she hopes, will mend her relationships with her longtime best friend and a new friend, as well as fix the mistake she made on her grandma's last day. In chapters that alternate between the Bunning Day parade and flashbacks of the events since her grandma's death, Ruby waits for the sign that everything will be all right.
","As in her previous novels Hound Dog True nd A Crooked Kind of Perfect, Linda Urban perfectly captures here the essence of being a sensitive tween girl wrestling with an internal problem. She addresses Ruby's grief with delicacy while highlighting the humorous aspects of her quirky town. Though this could not be called fast-paced, patient readers will stay interested as Urban gradually reveals the roots of Ruby's problems and retraces the events leading up to the Bunning Day celebration -- all of which adds up to a satisfying resolution.","Parents need to know that Ruby's beloved grandmother dies before The Center of Everything begins.

When he finally lets them (and a few tears) out at bedtime, Grandpa brings out his own boyhood stuffed llama and offers it to the youngster to snuggle with.

Once and for All,Grieving girl learns to love again in sweet romance.,"Louna has no illusions about love in ONCE AND FOR ALL. She's seen too much while helping her wedding-organizer mother and godfather handle every nuptial drama imaginable -- and a personal tragedy has left her emotionally raw. She's immediately annoyed by Ambrose, the quirky girl-magnet brother of an important client. She's even more irritated when her mother hires him and assigns Louna to keep him out of trouble. Louna finds Ambrose exasperating but is surprised by his enthusiasm and kindness. The pair make a bet: Ambrose is challenged to settle down with one girl, and Louna is challenged to start casually dating. As the summer goes on, what began as a lighthearted bet begins to feel much more important -- and confusing.
","Prolific author Sarah Dessen delivers another solid, charming romance with this story of a grieving girl learning to embrace life -- and love -- again after being shattered by a shocking tragedy. Set against a busy summer of wedding planning, Once and for All confronts cynicism over true love and arrives at a gentle conclusion: Worrying too much about how things could end means you risk missing out on all the wonderful moments possible along the way.
Louna is a smart, grounded teen, which makes her struggle all the more touching. Dessen portrays Ambrose with classic romantic charm without exploring why he's struggling to get along in the world. Despite the heavy backstory, this proves to be a warm and light romance -- perfect summer reading.","Parents need to know that Once and for All is a tender romance by Sarah Dessen (Saint Anything) about taking chances and looking beyond first impressions. There's a lot of heartbreak in the characters' backgrounds: Louna's first real boyfriend died violently, her father died in an accident after walking out on his family, both her mom and her gay godfather immerse themselves in work to avoid taking chances on romantic relationships, and her new friend Ambrose is considered the black sheep in his family. The story includes a very romanticized account of a girl's first time having sex. Teens drink at parties, and one has a hangover. The main characters appear to be all white, and there are some awkwardly forced, stereotypical descriptions of nonwhite characters who make fleeting appearances.

"The Golem's Eye (The Bartimaeus Trilogy, Book 2)","Bartimaeus returns -- alas, not to center stage.","Nathaniel, the main human character (though certainly not the hero) of the first book, is now the youngest junior minister ever in the government of an alternative British Empire run by magicians. To him falls the job of dealing with the increasingly annoying anti-magician resistance movement. When the destruction grows in scale, no one will believe Nathaniel that it's unrelated to the resistance, that it is in fact the work of a golem, controlled by a traitor in the government. So he summons Bartimaeus, as snide and reluctant as ever, and travels to Prague to find the secret of the golem.
Meanwhile Kitty, a member of the commoner resistance introduced briefly in the first book, is part of a group planning to raid Gladstone's tomb for artifacts of great power. Both her plans and Nathaniel's go badly wrong, setting the stage for a climactic confrontation with the golem.
","The good news is that Bartimaeus is back; the bad news is that there's not enough of him. What made the first book in this series a standout was his sarcastic commentary, self-aggrandizing descriptions, witty banter, and delightful footnotes detailing the workings of magic and demons in this alternative world. They're all still here, just less of them.
Meanwhile Nathaniel and Kitty alternately take center stage in a complex and often exciting, if too loosely edited, adventure involving, among many other things, grave-robbing, a demon living in Gladstone's bones, political intrigue, war, werewolf police, destruction, and a shadowy figure who seems to be playing all sides like puppets. Nathaniel, one of the least likeable main characters in children's literature, continues to fascinate and frustrate the reader with his growing power -- and obtuseness. The stage is clearly set for a grand finale in Book 3, presumably including Nathaniel's reclamation.","Parents need to know that this book is full of amoral and immoral characters. There's only one semi-admirable character, but most readers won't be rooting for her to succeed.

The Story of Owen: Dragon Slayer of Trondheim,Intriguing fantasy mixes modern-world dragons and politics.,"When a famous family of dragon slayers moves to her small Canadian town, 16-year-old Siobhan McQuaid quickly befriends Owen, the family's heir apparent and dragon-slayer-in-training. Humans have been fighting to survive against dragons forever, but lately the attacks have become more frequent and may soon become more than the dragon slayers can handle. Siobhan, Owen, and new friend Emily try to find out why the dragon population is on the rise and how they can stem the tide before all of southwest Ontario is engulfed in flames.
","With THE STORY OF OWEN: DRAGON SLAYER OF TRONDHEIM, E. K. Johnston creates a vivid, realistic modern world -- in which there are dragons. The level of detail is remarkable, encompassing everything from the effects of dragons on daily life to popular culture, as well as small-town and global politics. As a result, the dragon-fighting action tends to get lost in the shuffle, and kids looking for traditional dragon-fantasy lore might be disappointed. The premise, overlaying the world we all know with the fantasy element of dragons, is engaging and unique. Late middle-school- and high-school-aged kids ready for some broader context for their world, or perhaps who are budding politicos themselves, will enjoy the seamless integration of dragons into human history.
The backdrop of an evolving friendship between Siobhan and Owen as they navigate 11th grade will give kids relatable, admirable characters. Telling, small moments between the two create a touching friendship worthy of emulation. The action builds slowly between long passages of history and politics, but for the more mature teen reader it strikes a good balance and builds well to the final action-filled climax.","Parents need to know that The Story of Owen: Dragon Slayer of Trondheim is more of a geo- and socio-political history of North America (with dragons) than a traditional dragon-based fantasy. Seekers of magical realms with talking dragons, princesses, and knights in shining armor won't find them here. The dragons are wild animals that attack because they're hungry, and humans have been fighting them since prehistoric times. The few scenes with dragon attacks are brief and not gruesome, although there's a short but gory description of one burned dragon egg.

Sure Signs of Crazy,Unforgettable story of girl moving beyond her tragic past.,"The summer she turns 12, Sarah Nelson is still defined by her tragic past: Her mother, Jane, is prison for drowning her twin brother and trying to kill Sarah when the siblings were 2. Her alcoholic father relocates Sarah whenever the locals discover who they are. Lonely and secretive, Sarah has two diaries -- one real, one fake -- and writes letters to Atticus Finch, the lawyer dad in To Kill a Mockingbird. Her best friend is a plant, and she's worried she'll end up crazy like her mom. Sarah wants this summer to be different: She wants to fall in love, understand what the big deal is about kissing, be acknowledged as her own person, and have friends. To do that, she decides, requires confronting the person who changed everything: her mom.
","This book is a winning combination of empathy, tragedy, heroism, and humor -- an unforgettable read.
 Much like Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird, Sarah is a precocious, charming misfit trying to understand an often disappointing world. In SURE SIGNS OF CRAZY, Karen Harrington tips her hat to Harper Lee's classic while creating her own memorable heroine. It's a heartrending story that manages to avoid sentimentality. In many ways Sarah's a typical preteen: She's obsessed with piercing her ears and wants to be cool and sophisticated, and to fall in love, whatever that really means. Though she's clever and wise beyond her years, she's just as awkward and insecure as the next 12-year-old. ","Parents need to know that Sure Signs of Crazy is written from the perspective of a 12-year-old girl whose mentally ill mother killed her twin brother and tried to kill her when they were toddlers. Sarah's father is an alcoholic who means well but can only be counted on to let her down. Sarah snoops, lies, and steals, but not maliciously. She develops a crush on her 19-year-old neighbor and discovers romance novels. She gets her period and is coached by a college student on getting supplies and managing the discomfort.

Instead, they are soon lost in a scary forest, home to another witch, and a hunter she's cursed with hunting down children she's transformed into animals. Things get even scarier when Sol starts turning into a deer.
","THE WITCH'S CURSE is scary, funny, and heartfelt, and author Keith McGowan, helped by Yoko Tanaka's distinctive illustrations, manages this difficult balancing act in style.

Vincent and Theo: The Van Gogh Brothers,"Riveting story of art, mental illness, brotherly devotion.","VINCENT AND THEO were best friends from childhood, brothers with a bond that was sometimes shaken but never broken. Raised in the Netherlands by parents who loved nature, the arts, and books, both left home in their middle teens to begin working for their uncles, who owned prestigious art galleries in several European cities. While Theo was set on a career as an art dealer, Vincent struggled. Fired from his uncle's gallery, he had  religious reawakening, taught t a boy's boarding school in England, and attended theology school in Amsterdam and an evangelical training school in Brussels. Finally he decided to become an artist. Unable to support himself, he spent the rest of his life largely depending on Theo to send him money for food, shelter, and painting supplies. Both brothers had chaotic love lives, falling in love with women who either didn't return their affections or were ""unsuitable,"" and both had mental breakdowns.

"Changeling: Order of Darkness, Book 1","Tantalizing mix of historical romance, supernatural epic.","It's 1453 Italy, and gorgeous 17-year-old novitiate Luca Vero is accused of heresy for using logic. As punishment for his crime, Luca (who is rumored to be a changeling because he's so much cleverer and more beautiful than his thought-to-be barren parents) must join a secret order to investigate possible demonic activity across the papal realm. Along with his faithful and funny squire, Frieze, and a by-the-book clerk, Vero goes to an abbey where strange things are happening. The abbess turns out to be the lovely, grieving Isolde, who only agreed to be named head of the nunnery because the abbey sits on her family's property -- land she thought she would inherit upon her father's death. While exploring the seemingly possessed behavior of the abbey's nuns, Luca begins to wonder whether Isolde and her non-believer attendant, Ishraq, are actually witches, as one of the other nuns suggests.
","Unlike Philippa Gregory's thick tomes for adults, Changeling feels light -- too light. Best known for her sweeping historical romances The Other Boleyn Girl and The Red Queen, Gregory tries her hand at the young adult genre here. As in her other novels, there's plenty of intrigue, many class issues, and the beginnings of an epic romance here. Despite the many (often heavy) religious references -- mostly to Catholicism but also to Islam -- teens will be able to follow Gregory's flowing plot thanks to her progressive characters.
But teenagers are more than capable of reading 300-plus pages (just ask J.K. Rowling's fans); this one could have gone on longer but instead offers an abrupt ending. Isolde and Luca might be the main protagonists, but as is often the case, it's the two sidekicks, Frieze and Ishraq, who are more interesting (and get the best lines). Ishraq is more likely to pull a sword on a man than flirt with him, and Frieze is an amusing combination of verbose bravado and quiet tenderness (especially toward animals). Luca, although clearly handsome and brilliant, is almost unlikable at times, and it's a shame that Gregory didn't further explore the titular idea that he's indeed of fairy blood. Still, this is a fascinating page-turner, leaving readers hopeful for a heftier second installment.","Parents need to know that Changeling is the first young adult novel by best-selling historical romance author Phillipa Gregory (The Other Boleyn Girl). There are many references to Catholicism and the sacred vows observed by priests, nuns, and other religious officials. Because it takes place in the 15th century, much is made about the limited roles for women. There's some violence (characters are burned, poisoned, tortured, and nearly killed by a mob), but most of it stops just shy of an actual death. Sexuality is limited to mentions of impropriety and an affair and several longing looks between characters who are forbidden to act on their desires. A young man flirts with several women, and a young priest accidentally sees (from afar) two beautiful women taking a bath. Teens will have plenty to discuss, particularly about gender politics.

Don't Need Friends,Undeniably sweet tale avoids being saccharine.,"Rat lives in a friendly community of junkyard-dwelling animals, but when his best friend leaves, he becomes bitter and aloof. He meets his match in a new arrival, Dog, who is even more antisocial than he is. Exploring ideas of community and friendship, the story shows how individuals can deal with hurt and can bravely form new attachments.
 ","Although undeniably sweet, the story avoids being saccharine. Much of the credit goes to the illustrations, which effectively convey the atmosphere of the junkyard and the personalities of the characters. Author Carolyn Crimi looks at one of the ways in which we try to protect ourselves from hurt and disappointment. Children can readily see that Rat's attempt to deny his need for friends is self-defeating, but they also sympathize with his bluff and are touched when Rat and Dog gain enough trust to reveal (rather backhandedly) the kind hearts beneath their rough exteriors.
The scruffy denizens of the junkyard are a refreshing change from the many cuddly, bucolic animals usually residing in children's literature. Rats, possums, pigeons, and ownerless dogs: They live on the edges of ""official"" society in their own messy but companionable world, preoccupied with food and warmth -- both physical and emotional. Rather like children, in fact.","Parents need to know that the story line is greatly enhanced by the illustrations, which sympathetically portray the lives and looks of the junkyard creatures without sentimentalizing them.

Pieces and Players,Kids from various books unite in muddled art-heist story.,"After a small Chicago museum loses 13 priceless art works in a bold heist, the trustees call in help: 13-year-old Petra, Calder, and Tommy (Chasing Vermeer, The Wright 3, The Calder Game), Zoomy (The Danger Box), and Early(Hold Fast). As they seek the stolen objects, they travel to many Chicago sites of interest, get to know a lot of art installations, deal with adults behaving oddly, and cope with the challenges of getting to know one another and working together. (The fictitious Farmer Museum and its art are based on Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, from which the 13 works were stolen in 1990 and remain missing.) ","This story throws together a lot of disparate elements and often doesn't quite gel; readers who don't know the previous books (mentioned frequently) will often find themselves at sea. There's an oddly matter-of-fact acceptance in PIECES AND PLAYERS not only of the existence of ghosts but of the ability of long-dead people to communicate telepathically with people through images and poetry. Many readers will find the frequent emoting over artworks a bit much. But most off-putting is the chore of dealing with several characters' idiosyncratic quirks; Calder's constant fiddling with pentominoes (a math toy) and stream-of-consciousness, apparently oracular word associations; Zoomy's note-taking and punctuating his sentences with ""hodilly-hum"" and ""jittery-splat""; as well as several characters' tendency to burst out in Mother Goose rhymes. In the end, the payoff may not be worth the trouble.
For whatever reason, the book does not include actual images of the stolen art, which includes works by Rembrandt, Vermeer, and Degas, still missing in real life, even though it devotes much space to describing and analyzing them. Images are readily available on the Internet nd may help you follow along.","Parents need to know that Pieces and Players unites the now-13-year-old protagonists of various Blue Balliet books (including Chasing Vermeer) in yet another search for stolen art. Sometimes aided by the adults who want them to find the art, they break into buildings, get hauled to the police station, climb onto train tracks, befriend a ghost, use a Ouija board, and attempt to form telepathic bonds with the people in the stolen paintings. Meanwhile, they're also dealing with puberty-related awkwardness, from acne and BO to hoping members of the opposite sex like them. Though there are some mildly scary moments, there's no real violence; the only fatality is from natural causes.

Fangirl,Beautiful coming-of-age story about fandom and first love.,"Cath is a freshman in college with a lot of social anxiety and only two things that make her feel completely at home: her outgoing identical twin sister Wren (who chose to live in another dorm) and her love of the fantasy book series Simon Snow (an obvious tribute to Harry Potter). The ultimate FANGIRL, Cath writes popular fanfiction for the Simon Snow fandom. Stuck with Reagan, a surly, opinonated upperclassman roommate with no sense of boundaries, Cath barely leaves her dorm room. Despite her desire to stay away from people, Cath must deal with the near constant presence of Reagan's smiley, friendly, chatty boyfriend, Levi -- who begins to draw her out of her shell, and even more frightening, charm his way into her heart.
","Fangirl isn't just a charming love story about people, it's also a love story about fiction and the power of books and fandoms. Rowell, whose first book Attachments was a ""chick lit"" romantic comedy, burst onto the YA scene early in 2013 with the critically acclaimed misfit romance Eleanor & Park. She's apparently cranking out the quality realistic fiction with her follow-up out a scant eight months later. Fangirl shares a few similarities with E&P: the Nebraska setting, an intelligent, introverted girl who doesn't say much, and a guy who's almost too good to be true.
Every chapter begins with excerpts from not only Cath's fanfiction but also the ""canon"" of the Potter-like Simon Snow books. If you pay even cursory attention to the book-within-a-book, it's obvious that Simon, Baz, and Gemma T. Leslie are stand-ins for Harry, Draco, and author J.K. Rowling. Through her writing, Cath can express things she can't in real life, where she's extremely reclusive and socially inept. The only person besides Cath's party-girl sister, Wren, who can see the real her is Levi -- the kind of swoon-worthy guy that's sure to become any reader's literary crush. Cath and Levi have a host of issues, but their romance, slow and steady and startlingly real, will make anyone a believer in how books and love go hand in hand.","Parents need to know that Fangirl is the second young adult novel by New York Times bestselling author Rainbow Rowell. Set in a present Nebraska college (instead of an '80s Nebraska high school like Eleanor & Park), Fangirl follows an 18-year-old introvert's first year away at university. A hermit who only leaves the room for class, protagonist Cath is secretly a prodigious fanfiction writer in the Simon Snow fandom (think Harry Potter). While Cath is a virgin who doesn't drink or even really curse, other characters use strong language pretty regularly (""f--k,"" ""a--hole,"" ""douche,"" ""s--t,"" etc.) and discuss their sexual experience. The actual sexual content is fairly tame for a college-set story: limited to kissing and making out partially undressed in bed. Through Cath's introversion and Levi's dyslexia, the book also explores social anxiety and learning disabilities, as well as the importance of taking risks, academically and personally.

Alligators All Around,Alligators take readers through the ABCs.,"F is for fooling. G is for giggles. In this primer a family of alligators take readers through the ABCs. Maurice Sendak's little book is charming, and even though it's dated, it conveys the warmth and humor little ones desire always.
 ","The words are fun and effective and the illustrations are charming, but they may seem simplistic to today's audience. They're done in black and white with a few colors added, a printing style common in the early '60s. The expressions, however, are right as rain. In the illustration accompanying ""never napping,"" the young alligator has rings under the eyes and a deep slouch to the shoulders; in the art that goes with ""having headaches,"" the two adult alligators are lying in bed with damp cloths over their eyes.
Maurice Sendak has a way of blending the everyday with the bizarre, extending the possibilities of life. These alligators may be throwing tantrums and acting spoiled and fooling around, but they are also riding reindeer and entertaining elephants. The discontinuities penetrate, and in the process so do the letters.","Parents need to know that the words have been chosen for their memorability and the alligators are highly emotive -- it won't take long before read-alouds become harmonies.

I See Santa Everywhere,Funny but rough-looking Santas make this older-kid fare.,"This twisted take-off on the ""Santa Claus Is Coming to Town"" carol that most kids know takes that song one step further. A rather neurotic young boy begins to see Santas everywhere, and most of them are far from being the kindly old gent of more classic Christmas stories and songs. In fact, most depictions are rather menacing looking and definitely unbecomingly portrayed. The boy feels he is being stalked by this scary, judgmental Santa that he sees everywhere, and he seeks out a psychiatrist, hoping to get a little help with his fears. A surprising twist at the end will leave older readers wondering ... and chuckling.
","Overall, this book is clever and funny though not really appropriate for the young kids who are part of its intended audience. Those readers might be better served with one of the many versions of the original story, which has a number of illustrated versions. While I SEE SANTA EVERYWHERE derives easily from the traditional idea that Santa is everywhere, keeping an eye on every child's behavior, this version is an obvious exaggeration that is raised to the level of the absurd.
Whether readers appreciate it will rest partly on their relationship with Santa, and partly on their appreciation of cartoon artistry. Readers old enough to understand the playfulness of Santa's image, especially his judging of whose ""naughty"" and ""nice,"" will appreciate the strange, sometimes bizarre humor with which Glenn McCoy has created his imagined Santas. His cartooning is excellent. In fact, it's the best part of the book, and the part that redeems the questionable tone.","Parents need to know that they may find this book very funny, but its brand of humor is not geared toward younger kids. And the Santa lookalikes are rather rough looking, sporting tattoos, smoking, and toothless. For those who are ready for its message, the story does capture the stress many kids feel at Christmas time, especially the part about being judged ""naughty"" or ""nice"" on Santa's list.

The Peculiar,Half-faery boy fights to save his sister in magical fantasy.,"In a vaguely Victorian/steampunk alternate world where the Industrial Revolution is infused with magic and science fiction, the faeries (trapped in the human world by a cosmic mishap) and humans coexist with great suspicion, and the children of human-faery unions, called changelings or THE PECULIAR, get the worst of it. Changeling Bartholomew Kettle spends most of his time keeping himself and his sister Hettie (who has tree branches for hair) out of sight, but when he looks from his attic room to see a mysterious lady talking to the Peculiar boy across the street and spiriting him away in a puff of feathers, he has a bad feeling and suspects he or Hettie might be next. Magical powers, strange machinery, and universe-altering plots come into play in the adventures that follow, along with unlikely friendships and insights into those who aren't what they seem.
","Still in his teens as The Peculiar hits shelves, author Bachmann creates a compelling world, appealing characters, lurking humor, and a convoluted plot with a steady stream of revelations. Some readers may bog down in the descriptions and world-building, while others will revel in the detail. The book closes with a dramatic cliffhanger, but there's a sequel in the works.","Parents need to know that The Peculiar, by first-time author Stefan Bachmann -- a teen -- conjures up a scary, compelling alternate world in which kids with the wrong genes (known as changelings) are frequently murdered, and adults use magic, treachery, and physical violence to get their way. The weird imagery and violence may be too intense for some young readers: There's a bloody battle between humans and faeries (folkloric beings sometimes spelled ""fairies""); faeries and humans regularly kill changeling children, some who are found with their entrails mysteriously missing; and some other people die. But the characters are memorable, the vision is imaginative, and there are strong messages of friendship, family, loyalty, and protecting your loved ones even when it means risking your life.

A Princess of Mars,Old-style planetary romance is basis of John Carter film.,"Former Confederate soldier John Carter is trapped in an Arizona cave and then wakes up on Mars, known to the natives as \""Barsoom.\"" Because his body is built for Earth's gravity, he has tremendous strength on Mars and can leap great distances with little effort. He quickly wins the respect of Tars Tarkas, the ferocious leader of the six-limbed, green Martian Tharks. But when the Tharks capture the beautiful humanoid princess Dejah Thoris, Carter almost immediately falls in love with her and begins plotting their escape.
","A PRINCESS OF MARS is a product of another age, an adventure written to entertain an unsophisticated readership. Scientifically impossible and often woodenly narrated, it may be too old-fashioned for readers used to the best science fiction now available. But the book has been hugely influential, displays a good-natured innocence and certainly doesn't lack for action.","Parents need to know that A Princess of Mars -- which has been adapted for the new Disney film, John Carter, to be released March 9, 2012 -- is an old-fashioned adventure tale, a product of a different age with no swearing, little bloodshed in the many battles, and no premarital sex. First published as a novel in 1917 (serialized before that), its characters are flat, the dialogue stilted, and the male/female dynamics are practically prehistoric. And yet there is a giddy sense of invention here that can appeal to readers open to an unsophisticated but energetic narrative.

"Like a River Glorious: Gold Seer Trilogy, Book 2",Tense Gold Rush tale shows harsh reality of slavery.,"In LIKE A RIVER GLORIOUS, Lee and fellow wagon train travelers have arrived in California, and it's time to stake some claims and get digging and panning. With Lee's ability to sense gold, she settles them near a pond in a floodplain. Of course, they're instantly successful, but Lee can't celebrate. Claim jumpers with guns in the dark had already threatened them once, and it won't be long before her villainous uncle and his men come looking for her. So she decides to tell everyone her big secret and the danger they're in. One family decides to leave right away to protect themselves while the others stick it out and befriend some other miners, hoping for strength in numbers. It doesn't help in the end: Their camp is set on fire, and someone is shot and killed on watch. Now Lee knows she must find a way to face her uncle to keep her friends safe.
","Readers who made the harrowing cross-country wagon trip with Lee in Book 1 may be expecting less drama in Book 2, but this satisfying sequel is full of nail-biting moments. Even before Lee's greedy and corrupt Uncle Hiram enters Like a River Glorious, claim jumpers and Hiram's henchmen are a constant threat.
And then we reach Hiram's camp. The contrast between Glory, California, where Lee's friends settle, and Hiram's Gulch is jarring. Lee's awakening to the injustice of slavery tempers her response to her own pretty serious troubles, making her an even more enviable character. Author Rae Carson lets things get pretty grim at Hiram's Gulch, steeping the story in the harsh reality of the times, but that allows her the room to work toward justice in an even more profound way.","Parents need to know that Like a River Glorious, by Rae Carson (the Girl of Fire and Thorns trilogy), is the second absorbing book in the Gold Seer trilogy. It stars Lee, a girl whose parents are murdered in Georgia by her uncle, who wants to exploit her ""witchy"" bility to find gold. After Lee makes the harrowing journey west in Walk on Earth a Stranger, she and her friends are trying to start a mining camp -- until she's drugged and kidnapped and taken to her uncle's slave-labor mining operation, where the worst of the violence occurs. Native Americans are forced to work naked and are shot, whipped, and starved to death. Lee witnesses one slave shot in the head in front of her, sees a starved corpse left in the mud, and watches another man get stabbed in the back. Plenty of men smoke and some drink moonshine and whiskey. Like Book 1, this story tackles tough topics such as racism and gender inequality with sensitivity, owing mostly to the wonderful main character: Lee is  strong teen girl who's deep in her convictions about treating everyone fairly -- not common for the 1849 time period.

The Man in the Moon: The Guardians of Childhood,Adventures of young Man in the Moon a perfect bedtime read.,"The Man in the Moon wasn't always a man; he was once a little boy, called MiM, and this book tells his story through the sailing of great ships and the fighting of great battles, including one between Pitch, the King of Nightmares, and Nightlight, the brave guardian of MiM. Readers find out what MiM does with balloons after they float into Earth's sky and the origins of some of the most beloved children's fantasy characters, including Santa Claus, Mother Goose, the Sandman, and the Easter Bunny.
","THE MAN IN THE MOON is breathtaking. It has an old-fashioned feel, yet at the same time seems very modern and fresh. Author-illustrator William Joyce weaves a fantastic tale that gives the origins of the bright, friendly face children see in the night sky. There is fun, fantasy, a dramatic battle, and personal loss. Most of all there is hope. Readers will love the new twist on familiar faces from children's literature and lore, and the book may even pique an interest in astronomy.
Joyce's wonderful storytelling is amplified by his dazzling illustrations, which are sophisticated yet whimsical. Each page stands alone as a work of art and clearly conveys the emotion of the story. When the Nightmare King rolls across the page in all of his gloom, it ups the excitement, intrigue, and apprehension.","Parents need to know that there is a scary part in which MiM, the title character, loses three people very close to him.

One Small Step,Absurd premise yields a thrilling story.,"In the late '60s, Scott's father is an Air Force flight trainer in Texas. He teaches Scott to fly in a private plane, but then, against the rules, also teaches him to fly fighter jets. When Scott's father is knocked out in an in-flight accident and Scott lands the plane, NASA takes notice. They have a secret program that precedes each of the manned rocket launches with a scaled down test flight using chimps. Before the moon landing, one of their highly trained chimps wigs out, and they enlist Scott to train to fly to the moon and back with two other chimps. Includes Author's Note.
","OK, granted, there's a huge suspension of disbelief to get over with this book. NASA secretly sending a boy and two chimps to land on the moon before Apollo 11 has to be one of the most absurd premises ever. The author compounds this with references to possible UFOs, a mystical encounter in the last part of the story, and an Author's Note that claims much of the Apollo program is ""still shrouded in secrecy"" and that no one really knows when the chimp program was discontinued. Even fans of Tom Swift may have to take a deep breath before swallowing all of that.
And yet ... take the leap, and you'll find an immensely enjoyable, exciting, engrossing story, the stuff of hours of childhood fantasy. Scott and the chimps are appealing characters, and the details are as grounded in scientific and historical reality as the premise is not. Scott is a boy's boy in the '50s series-book mold: stalwart, vastly competent and levelheaded, openhearted, and calmly willing to defy adult authority to do things his way, outwitting them at every turn. This is nearly perfect summer reading -- ridiculous escapism at its purest.","Parents need to know that, though the publisher lists this book for ages 8 and up, and the story certainly seems meant for that age, there are numerous sexual references, and more swearing than you'd expect in a book aimed at middle elementary-aged kids. Also, a boy is encouraged and aided in lying to his mother by his father and by government agents, including the president.

One with nuts descends from the top of the page and he says, ""Thanks!""

At this the pigeon flies into a rant about all his requests that get turned down, including ""I ask to drive the bus!"" and ""I ask to stay up late!"" He rails about how unfair it is: ""Ducklings get everything."" Then the duckling says he got the cookie so he could give it to the pigeon. The pigeon is won over, calms down, and says, ""Thank you."" Then the duckling asks for another cookie -- without nuts.
","The adorable, big-eyed duckling almost steals the show in THE DUCKLING GETS A COOKIE!?, but there are plenty of laughs in seeing the pigeon enraged when he thinks he's being treated unfairly.

To find the missing girl, they'll need to assemble a crack team including a magician, an expert lock picker, a codebreaker -- oh yeah, and  ghost. When almost nothing and no one turn out to be what they seem, the kids soon learn that they'll have to unravel mysteries from the past as well as the present if they hope to catch the kidnappers.
","This standalone mystery set in the wonderfully oddball Greenglass House world is full of intrigue, puzzlement, colorful characters, and a clever plot that moves along nicely. The Thief Knot brings back old friends that fans of the series will enjoy spending time with again, while at the same time introducing a very interesting new bunch worthy of further exploration. Mystery and adventure lovers who haven't read any of the previous books will have no trouble fully immersing themselves in this refreshing new story. Tweens will easily relate to the characters and root for Marzana as she tries to help solve a crime while battling social anxiety.
The opening is a little slow, spending too much time on complaints about how nothing exciting ever happens when the reader knows good and well that something amazing is going to happen, or else what are all the rest of these pages in the book for? But hang in there until the adventure starts, and you'll be quickly absorbed in an inventively whimsical and slightly off-kilter world. There's not much imagined folklore in this story, which, compared with the other Greenglass books, makes it feel just a bit less rich. But it's a deeply imagined and vividly described world that stands up well on its own.","Parents need to know that The Thief Knot is a standalone mystery-adventure story set in the world of author Kate Milford's Greenglass House series. Reading the other books isn't necessary, but some characters from them appear here. The main plot involves middle school kids investigating the kidnapping of a girl their age, and there are a few moments of fearful speculation bout what could happen to her. The only other violence is in a confrontation with the bad guys with a knife to the throat, slamming against a locker, and a hard kick in the stomach. There are some mildly eerie locations as well as a lot of whimsical ones. A kiss on the cheek and squeezing hands are the only instances of romance. Adults drink wine with dinner, and there's one mention of a background character smoking. Strong language is very rare but includes ""crap,"" ""hell,"" and ""damn.""

Merci Suarez Changes Gears,"Upbeat coming-of-age story explores culture, class, aging.","""Do a good job, so they know we're serious people,"" dvises Merci's dad in MERCI SUAREZ CHANGES GEARS. Merci has big shoes to fill: Her brother Roli is a star high school student who's almost too old to care about Merci's sixth grade challenges. And thanks to the popular crowd at Seaward Pines Academy, Merci has plenty of challenges. How can she keep from being the butt of Edna Santos' zinger comments when her Papi drives a beat-up painting van, her bike seat is losing its stuffing, and her darned eye won't stop wandering? On top of that, a new cute boy from Minnesota has been assigned to Merci as her ""Sunshine Buddy"" -- a duty of the school's welcoming committee -- which means Merci's every move is being scrutinized by the popular girls. At home, her grandfather is behaving strangely, which turns Merci's world upside down.
","Fascinating in its depiction of Cuban American culture, this optimistic story portrays immigrant life in South Florida. Kids will relate to the OMG-so-awkward moments that Merci suffers in sixth grade. Her place in the social pecking order isn't quite secure, and the girls she thought were her friends show flashes of brilliant charm and stunning cruelty in the blink of an eye. What Merci has that those kids might not is a rich family tradition that's so woven into her core values that she's unaware of how lucky she is. Sure, she shares a room with her brother and is obligated to watch her twin cousins after school, but the pride she takes in playing on her Papi's soccer team, and the loving relationship she shares with her grandfather, Lolo, are priceless. Author Meg Medina immerses Merci Suarez Changes Gears in a culture that many readers might not be intimately familiar with. The ""Gilda"" crackers, the Noche-buena Christmas Eve traditions, the delicious food her abuela cooks, and most of all, the closeness that defines many immigrant families. The plot takes a few chapters to get moving, but by the end of the book, Merci and her family feel like friends and neighbors. ","Parents need to know that Meg Medina's Merci Suarez Changes Gears won the 2019 Newbery Medal. Merci Suarez is a sixth-grader whose Cuban American family works hard to give her a great education by sending her to an elite private school.

Unhooked,"Gory, monster-filled fantasy romance best for genre fans.","All her life, 17-year-old Gwen has been uprooted every time her artist mom becomes convinced they're being pursued by monsters. When the latest episode lands them in a spooky old house in London, her only comfort is that her best friend, Olivia, is staying for a couple of weeks. But on the first night in the new house, both girls are abducted by terrifying beings to different parts of a strange, magical world. It's Neverland, but not one that J.M. Barrie or Walt Disney would recognize. Struggling with hallucinations and forgetfulness, Gwen soon realizes that her mom's fears were all too well founded, and tries to figure out who, if anyone, in this threatening, violent world, she can trust to help her and Olivia get home. Especially since both the ""Peter Pan"" and ""Captain Hook"" figures are charming, murderous, and full of secrets.
","Lisa Maxwell offers an intriguing premise in her violent, magic-drenched version of Neverland, which quickly comes UNHOOKED from the original as teen heroine Gwen struggles against evil forces. The first-person, present-tense narrative will grab many readers, especially those who like their romantic tales on the dark side. But heads up: There's a lot of gore, and much dwelling on the details, as the body count rises; some scenes find hero and heroine slogging through piles of corpses.
Some will find the cosmology and world-building a bit uneven, as critical facts and characters sometimes get superficial treatment, while others will love Gwen's courage and determination to do right, despite magical forces and swoon-worthy but murderous boys..","Parents need to know that Unhooked, by Lisa Maxwell, is a dark twist on the Peter Pan story starring 17-year-old Gwen in Neverland, but it's but not the familiar place of childhood tales. Here, both the ""Peter Pan"" and ""Captain Hook"" characters are crazy-attractive teen boys who survive by consuming the life force of their victims; violent deaths are plentiful, by suicide, stabbing, hacking, slashing, devouring, and magic, as are vivid descriptions of the gore. Literally and psychologically, the ground is constantly shifting under protagonist/narrator Gwen's feet as she tries to save herself and her best friend, while trying to decide which of the two charming, murderous boys is less likely to betray her. Some language (""arse,"" ""bloody,"" ""hell,"" ""Christ!"") shouldn't be problematical to most high-school-age readers, but this version of the Peter Pan myth may be too dark for some.

The X-Files: Earth Children Are Weird,Cute but thin picture book inspired by sci-fi TV series.,"In THE X-FILES: EARTH CHILDREN ARE WEIRD, young Dana Scully is reading Fox Mulder a story about aliens while they camp in a backyard. Spooked, Fox is sure aliens have landed -- but Dana, ever the practical one, shows him how the scary shadow is just a dog and the spooky noise is an animal and an old swing. Fox chalks it up to his wild imagination ... until he and Dana find aliens inside their tent! The aliens run away as Dana and Fox flee into the house, baffling the adults relaxing in the glow of a TV screen.
","Grown-up fans of the sci-fi classic The X-Files will get a kick out of sharing this decent picture book with young future fans, but unfortunately it isn't nearly as clever or engaging as the TV show. The X-Files: Earth Children Are Weird bears only a superficial connection to its namesake, though it's a fine enough scare-debunking story for very young kids (who won't be ready for Scully and Mulder's grown-up adventures for many years).
Kim Smith's charming illustrations capture the coziness -- and spookiness! -- of backyard camping. Attentive kids may spot the UFO in the opening pages, and they'll know the truth that's out there before the campers discover it. Some sensitive children might be upset by the surprise unmasking of aliens, so adults may want to peek at the end before reading it aloud.","Parents need to know that The X-Files: Earth Children Are Weird features Fox Mulder and Dana Scully -- the main characters in the popular science fiction TV series The X-Files -- as children, getting spooked during a backyard campout. Most of the scary things they see and hear are easily explained, but they soon discover there really are aliens in the backyard. Young readers will be in on the joke, and any nervousness over the spooky themes will give way to giggles as Dana and Fox fail to notice a half-dozen cheery-looking aliens in the woods. Dana and Fox's friendship underpins the comforting tone of the book. A surprise Twilight Zone-style twist at the end could upset some kids.

Making Up Megaboy,A disturbing novel with no easy answers.,"13-year-old Robbie Jones has just murdered an elderly storekeeper, and no one knows why. He always seemed like just a nice, normal kid. Through interviews, news reports, and court documents the author reveals the story, but not the reasons. In this brief book with no easy answers, readers are left with much to think about.
The facts are beyond dispute. On the day he turns 13, Robbie Jones takes a gun out of his father's dresser, rides his new bicycle to a liquor store downtown, and fatally shoots the elderly Korean storekeeper. The only question remaining is why--and Robbie won't, or can't, say.
In documentary format, through news reports and through interviews with Robbie's parents, friends, classmates, teacher, principal, counselor, and lawyer, as well as with the police officers and the victim's widow, author Virginia Walter lays down the facts and opinions, then leaves readers to draw their own conclusions.
","This disturbing novel has no easy answers or neat endings. It seems straight out of the headlines, and is likely to provoke great discussions. In short takes, Virginia Walter captures the essence of the personalities involved: Robbie's hard-nosed dad, his bewildered friend, his self-involved classmates. Only Robbie, who is silent throughout, remains an enigma, his feelings expressed only through his comic strip, ""Megaboy.""
The author only hints at what might have led to this tragedy. No one seems to know this child at all -- not even his parents. The book's short, easy-to-read format, as well as its tough-minded attitude, compelling subject, edgy computer-generated collages, and Robbie's superhero drawings, will appeal to reluctant readers. The graphic design makes the book look both unique and cool, and enhances the ripped-from-the-headlines feeling.","Parents need to know that this edgy story revolves around the killing of a store owner by a 13-year-old boy. Told in documentary format, it depicts and alienated boy who expresses himself through art. It leaves much for readers to discuss and evaluate, and provides no easy answers.

Hour of the Bees,Tween finds herself and her roots in gripping magical tale.,"Twelve-year-old Carol lives in suburban Albuquerque and is looking forward to a summer of hanging out with her friends before they all start middle school. But that's not what happens -- instead, her whole family heads for the middle of nowhere to a barren ranch owned by the grandfather she's never met. His health is failing, he's suffering from dementia, and her dad has hired a lawyer to have the old man declared incompetent so he can be put in assisted living and the ranch sold off.  Armed with chirpy brochures from the assisted living facility, the family is determined to keep Grandpa Serge calm as they prepare the place for sale. Charged with keeping the old man out of trouble, Carol is startled when he tells her not to spit on her roots, and she quickly becomes fascinated with his stories about two century-old kids named Sergio and Rosa, a magic tree that used to live in the land, the lake that used to be there, and the bees who stole it away drop by drop. Everybody thinks it's just crazy talk when the old man calls Carol by her long-dead grandmother Rosa's name and raves about bees coming back and ending the hundred-year drought. But then, everywhere Carol goes, there are bees where none have been seen for decades.
","First-time author Lindsay Eagar's heartfelt, gripping, original novel finds its relatable, 12-year-old heroine connecting with long-lost family nd centuries-old magic in rural New Mexico. HOUR OF THE BEES takes its young narrator and readers on a life-altering journey, as a summer on her dementia-stricken grandfather's arid sheep ranch puts her in touch with roots she didn't know she had and makes her see things from a new perspective:
""I'm surprised, too -- this sounds nothing like me. Caring about my roots? Worrying about what will happen to this ranch, this land? But try as I may to push this frustration away, my eyes sting with tears.
""I hide my face with a glance out the window. Dad and Mr. González are still pacing the pasture. Are they debating how much this ranch is worth? Probably not much to the rest of the world -- not much in dollars -- but it's Serge's home. The place where sheep tell time.""","Parents need to know that Lindsay Eagar's luminous debut, Hour of the Bees, intertwines the story of a magical tree and the people it sustained with the tale of a life-changing summer for 12-year-old Carol, who has issues of her own (""I don't want to be Mexican. Or American. Or Mexican-American. Or Caro-leeen-a. Just being Carol is hard enough""). There are plenty of heavy subjects, from the drought that's laid waste to the land to the deep rifts within families. A character is forcibly removed from his home ""for his own good,"" and much of Carol's internal conflict comes from her growing sense of wrongness about this. People and animals, some beloved, die, and readers may want to keep a box of tissues handy for some scenes. There's a bit of mild language (""poo,"" ""pissed,"" ""crap,"" ""sucks""), and in a desperate-times-call-for-desperate-measures scene, a tween character steals a car. But overall, the captivating narrative voice and the strong messages of love, family, courage, and not spitting on your roots carry the day.

Saving Lucas Biggs,Girl time-travels to save dad in thought-provoking story.,"Margaret's dad -- a whistle-blowing geologist who let the community know fracking was hurting the town's water supply -- is framed for murder by greedy fossil fuel executives and sentenced to death by the judge they keep in their pocket. To save her dad's life, Margaret uses a genetic ""quirk"" to travel back in time to the late 1930s, trying to stop a similar wrong that happened to the judge's family when he was still a boy -- and that turned his heart to stone. She returns to the modern world to continue her fight, with her best friend Charlie and his grandfather faithfully by her side, and learns important lessons about the power of focusing on the good in the world versus the evil, about all the different ways people around her have been truly brave, and why it's ultimately better to focus on the present, which is ""here and here and here...and all of it yours.""
","SAVING LUCAS BIGGS is an ambitious book that will teach readers about a wide range of topics, including fracking, Quaker history, and what it means to be a whistle-blower. As readers travel through the late 1930s and the modern day with brave Margaret, they'll also be left to think about their own definitions of brave, including whether pacifists would be included in the description and whether they believe small acts of goodness can trump true evil. Time travel is an essential element of the plot, but this book is better off for tweens interested in social justice than science fiction.
Some may think that the conclusion comes off as overly convenient, and it does read a bit like a simplistic Hollywood ending. But the book's more complicated ideas about collective good and bravery -- and the sweet characters such as Margaret, Charlie, and their families, who continue to stand by those they love -- will keep readers engaged to the end.","Parents need to know that Saving Lucas Biggs is a story that involves time travel, moral and legal issues, and a scientist who speaks up about the dangers of fracking to save his community. There's some violence: Margaret's father is sentenced to death after being wrongly accused of setting a fire that killed a man; workers are injured in a mine accident; a security force uses a tank to open fire on a striking worker camp, injuring and killing many people, including children; a man is murdered, and another has his head bashed in; and later, the injured man is hanged, though it's made to look like a suicide. Tween and teen readers ready for this intense material will learn about a wide range of topics, including fracking, Quaker history, and what it means to be a whistle blower. They'll also think about being brave and may develop a wider definition of the word. Margaret's idea that “good + good + good + good > BAD"" is particularly inspiring considering what she's going through.

Heroines: Great Women Through the Ages,Twelve women battle prejudice in anthology.,"Twelve female crusaders battle prejudice and persecution in this inspiring anthology. Joan of Arc, Sacagewea, Frida Kahlo, and others fight such obstacles as small-minded opponents, racism, and physical disabilities as they forge bold legacies. The writing is effective, but soft watercolor illustrations undercut the vivid text.
 ","Some of the women throughout history who have challenged the status quo get their due in this uneven large-format book. Rebecca Hazell brings these women to life by sprinkling human-interest details throughout. The author is frank about the consequences of some of the heroines' actions and the outcomes, including physical abuse, imprisonment, and being burned alive, as well as the practice of buying, selling, and trading humans.
Hazell speculates about those whose deaths went unrecorded: ""With so many skills,"" she writes, ""perhaps Sacagawea could have escaped her husband, made her way back to her tribe, and lived to be a wise old woman. We will never know, any more than Sacagawea knew that she was making history."" Fact boxes have inconsistently organized information linked to hard-to-locate numbers on an indistinct map. The watercolor drawings are suggestive but lack detail, and thus merely hint at the vigor of these women's lives.","Parents need to know that the 12 heroines profiled here lived from ancient times to modern history and represent a variety of cultures and talents. They include Harriet Tubman and Sacagawea, as well as Eleanor of Aquitaine, Joan of Arc, Queen Elizabeth I, Madame Sun Yat-Sen, Marie Curie, Amelia Earhart, and Frida Kahlo.

"Walk on Earth a Stranger: Gold Seer Trilogy, Book 1",Girl hides as boy for harrowing journey west in taut tale.,"When Lee's best friend Jefferson proposes marriage and a trip west to California, Lee balks. She has her parents on the Georgia farm to think about, and besides, the proposal seems kind of half-hearted. But when she gets home one day, she’s shocked to find both her parents dead and their stash of gold gone. She easily traces the crime to her Uncle Hiram; she has ""witchy"" powers she's kept hidden -- or so she thought -- that can find gold when it's close by, and Hiram has bits of gold dust all over him. She knows she must escape, but Jefferson is already gone and has promised to wait in Independence, Missouri, for her only until the wagons move out. In haste, she cuts her hair short and dons her father's old clothes. She moves fast on her horse until robbers find her. It’s only the first of many hardships ahead.
","Readers will root for sublime hero Lee as she disguises herself in men’s clothes and takes on each hardship in this hair-raising adventure. It's hard to imagine wanting to follow anyone west with a wagon, cholera, measles, heatstroke, stampeding buffalo, and trigger-happy leering men for company, but readers will want to follow Lee.
The hint of fantasy -- Lee's special, secret ability to sense gold nearby -- adds to the tension nd opens up some possibilities for the rest of the series. The serious looks at racism and gender inequality add a poignancy to WALK ON EARTH A STRANGER and make it a great story to read and discuss with teens.","Parents need to know that Walk on Earth a Stranger, by Rae Carson (the Girl of Fire and Thorns trilogy), is the first in the very promising Gold Seer trilogy. It stars Lee, a girl whose parents are murdered in Georgia by her uncle, who wants to exploit her ""witchy"" bility to find gold. She disguises herself as a boy to evade her uncle and heads west to California. Just about everything that can go wrong on a wagon train goes wrong: People die from cholera, come down with measles, die of heat exhaustion, die in childbirth, die getting crushed by a wagon, and need a leg amputated. Some of the deaths are quite sad. The leg-amputation scene and a childbirth scene are long and gory. In keeping with the time, plenty of men smoke pipes and cigars and some drink moonshine to drunkenness. The story tackles tough topics such as racism and gender inequality with sensitivity, owing mostly to the wonderful main character: Lee is a mix of tough exterior, to face life’s incredible hardships, and rich interior, pondering the unfairness of life.

Froi of the Exiles,Character-driven fantasy is extraordinary for older teens.,"FROI OF THE EXILES picks up three years after Isaboe and Finnikin broke the spell of Lumatere. Froi, that foul-mouthed boy who ends up in Queen Isaboe's debt, has turned into Lumatere's most promising -- if impetuous -- young warrior. When he's sent on a secret mission to kill the tyrannical leader of neighboring Charyn, Froi knows he's up for the challenge. But his simple plan becomes much more complicated when he encounters the mysterious, mentally unstable princess of Charyn, Quintana. Like Lumatere, Charyn is faced with its own curse, and Froi begins to realize that the land speaks to him in a way Lumatere never has. Like his mentor Finnikin before him, Froi must decide whether to follow his head or his heart, even though the consequences might have unintended consequences for everyone he loves.
","Melina Marchetta is an exceptional writer, but it has still been surprising to see a specialist of contemporary teen fiction transition so seamlessly to the fantasy genre. Despite their medieval setting, the Lumatere Chronicles explore the same themes that Marchetta so beautifull conveys in books like Jellicoe Road and Saving Francesca. As the author herself has acknowledged, Froi and Quintana have the same trajectory as Jonah and Taylor in Jellicoe Road -- they're emotionally broken and in need of the other to help heal.
Like Finnikin and Isaboe, Froi and Quintana feel an almost otherworldly pull to be with each other, but their story is even sadder -- and more frought with obstacles, if that's possible -- than the queen and her king's. Once again, the book follows several points of view, and some of the secondary characters are just as compelling as Froi, especially Phaedra, the estranged Charynite wife of Lucian of the Monts; and Lady Beatriss, who finally realizes that she wants Captain Trevanion to know what really happened to her during the decade they spent apart. Gorgeously written and thoroughly detailed, this is one of the best fantasy epics in all of young-adult literature. Even those who eschew the genre should give it a try.","Parents need to know that Froi of the Exiles -- this second installment in Melina Marchetta's Lumatere Chronicles -- features issues as mature as those in Finnikin of the Rock. There are depictions of violence and sexuality that may not be appropriate for younger readers, but mature teens -- even those who don't normally read the fantasy genre -- will find this complex, character-driven story chock full of intrigue and valuable lessons about hope, family, destiny, and what it means to feel truly at home. That said, there's definitely violence -- people are raped, executed, tortured, injured, and taken by sickness -- and more sex than in Finnikin.

Though the paper princess finds one adventure after the next and meets a wonderful cast of characters along the way, she longs for the little girl who made her and tries to find her way back.
","THE PAPER PRINCESS is an unexpected charmer, by turns adventurous, sweet, and heartfelt. And there's nothing traditionally princess-y about this half-finished paper doll who flies about looking for wondrous experiences. With gorgeous mixed-media collages and inventive turns, the story moves beautifully and expressively through a richly created world, evoking all the longing, thrill, and excitement of innocent exploration on the path to gaining independence.
There are multiple entry points for a spectrum of readers here -- the beauty of art making, the letting go of our creations, the wonderment of exploring the world, the importance of allowing the world to shape us, and the desire always to return home. Parents will love the tenderness of this message, and kids will delight in the story's exciting landscapes. ","Parents need to know that The Paper Princess, by author-illustrator Elisa Kleven, is a delightful, imaginative book that uses the idea of making a paper princess to celebrate autonomy, exploration, and adventurousness. As readers follow the adventure of a paper princess who gets whooshed away in the wind, they experience the multifaceted slivers of the world through her eyes.

Ash Princess,"Torture, genocide make absorbing fantasy for mature teens.","In ASH PRINCESS, Theodosia is a 16-year-old Astrean captive of the conquering Kalovaxians. She lives at court, is close friends with Cress, the gorgeous daughter of the Kaiser's right-hand man, and has a slave do her hair and dress her in fancy gowns. But there are many differences between Cress' life and court and her own. Theodosia is forced to give up her own name. She is Thora to the Kalovaxians. Her old name, which shows her claim to the Astrean throne, is literally beaten out of her. She has three guards watch her at all times, she's whipped every time her people rebel against the Kaiser, and at parties, she's forced to wear a crown of ashes that disintegrates as she wears it. When she's summoned to the throne room for what she expects is another whipping, she discovers a prisoner there. It's her own father, and a prominent Astrean rebel, beaten to near death after an uprising in the mines. Thora/Theo is forced to kill him in front of the court. While the Kaiser revels in his victory, three more rebels kill the princess' guards, secretly take their place, and offer her a quick means of escape. Thora/Theo is tempted, but realizes she can do far more for her people if she stays at court. Especially when the Kaiser's son begins to take a strong interest in her.
 ","Fans of very dark fantasies should overlook the word ""princess"" in the title and dive into this absorbing world of cruel conquerors, court intrigue, and budding rebellion. Even though there's a 16-year-old princess who wears pretty dresses and fancies the prince, after 10 years of torture and the genocide of her people, she's also a princess seething with hatred and the need to do something. When Theo is forced to kill her own father, this darker side finally begins to overtake her. And when her guards are killed and replaced by rebels (though it seems highly unlikely, even with magical help, that this won't get noticed) Theo is ready for transformation. Yet ... what to do about the prince?
Author Laura Sebastian does a great job conveying the complexity of Theodosia's relationships -- with the prince who hates his own father; with Cress, the sheltered girl at court who claims to be Theo's friend; and with the rebels who don't trust that Theo is up for the job of leading a rebellion. What's missing is more on how the magic in this world works. We know that Theo thinks it's sacrilege to practice it without training, but know very little about what the power can really do. Perhaps Book 2 will enlighten us.","Parents need to know that Ash Princess is the first book in a fantasy series that is not for readers who look for books with the word ""princess"" in the title. There's a 16-year-old princess, yes, but she's held captive for a decade, whipped repeatedly, and subjected to psychological torture by a Kaiser who has taken over her country, enslaved her people, and killed off most of them. The brutality is pretty close at hand, too. Besides being whipped, the princess is forced to kill her own father with a sword. A 13-year old is forced to drink a poison that burns her from the inside out. Other mature content includes some kissing and 16-year olds drinking wine. The publisher lists this book for early teen readers, but it seems more in line with books for high schoolers, not middle schoolers. High schoolers will more easily grasp the themes in Ash Princess. It examines the high price of governance by fear and absolute power, and whether a son should pay for the sins of the father.

Little Boy,"A sweet book to celebrate a new son, and his dad.","A father thinks about the everyday moments and adventures in a little boy's life that make his world special, and considers how much the future depends on those simple things.
","In a format similar to her last book, the bestseller Someday, Alison Mcghee joyfully celebrates a little boy, and his dad. With the same gentleness and in the same graceful, handwritten text, she follows the child through his day as he runs exuberantly through life in his shorts and striped t-shirt, sometimes donning a red superman cap, at other times a space helmet made of an upside-down bowl. A yellow cup and a big cardboard box keep resurfacing as the games change in this world that is full of imagination and simple things.
The father also resurfaces now and then, smiling as he measures the boy or pulls the cookies out of the oven that he and his son have baked. The message is subtle, but heartwarming and solid, and it's repeated in a line that threads throughout the book. So much in life depends on the everyday moments, on the things that seem small and quiet and playful. Kids need time to become themselves, and parents need time to enjoy it all. And everyone could use a big cardboard box!","Parents need to know that this book is a poem about the simple things that make the little boy's world so precious. New parents, or grandparents, will love reading and reflecting on the loving lines as the sweet little boy tumbles playfully through its pages. Also, the father is the prominent parent here.

But Scarlett has a lot to learn about how complicated love can be -- and about how to start pursuing her own path.
","Like Caletti's other work, this is a rich, emotional novel filled with life lessons that will touch readers' hearts. They will certainly identify with sweet Scarlett and understand why she is angry at her sister's inability to appreciate all that she has, including a wonderful husband and baby on the way. 
They may, however, find that some of Scarlett's kind acts strain credibility; towards the end of the book she goes so far as to stuff a lonely neighbor's mailbox full of letters and postcards she has written, and even hangs paper cranes from his  tree.  Even so, it's the smaller, more realistic moments that will really stick with readers, such as when Scarlett's mom realizes how much her younger daughter needs her, or when Juliet finally admits that she is afraid of how much she loves the new family she's creating.  ","Parents need to know that Scarlett's sister, who had an active sex life in high school, gets pregnant before getting married. Scarlett kisses a couple boys, including her surprised new brother-in-law. There is some swearing, and one character smokes at night.  Readers will admire Scarlett's deep caring for the people in her world, as well as her growing ability to stand up for herself. They will find lots of good messages here, most importantly to that it's OK to hope, pursue what you want -- and to ""know when you've reached an end.""

Inventing Victoria,Teen reinvents herself in engaging post-Reconstruction tale.,"When INVENTING VICTORIA begins, it's 1881, and Essie, an African American girl living in Savannah, has just lost her estranged mother, a prostitute who owned a brothel that served prominent clients. She's working as a cleaning woman in a boarding house. Essie has a strong work ethic and great determination to educate herself by reading books. Her attitude catches the attention of an older woman who frequently stays at the boarding house, and the woman offers to groom Essie for elite black society in Washington, D.C. Essie accepts and christens herself Victoria. Victoria prepares for her future, makes peace with her past, and finds a way to give back to the community from which she came.
","This ambitious, engaging historical novel gives readers a glimpse of the diverse lifestyles of African Americans during the post-Reconstruction era.

She also successfully tackles the emotional price of ""bettering"" oneself, an issue that's relevant to teens and families today.

The Hate U Give,Powerful story of police shooting of unarmed Black teen.,"In THE HATE U GIVE, Starr Carter is a teen between two worlds: her school, which is rich, fancy, and white; nd her neighborhood, which is poor and black. She navigates this differing terrain every day of her life until her worlds collide when she witnesses the fatal police shooting of her best friend, Khalil, an unarmed black teen. Khalil's death goes viral, and Starr is caught in the middle between the protesters in the street and her friends at school. With the eyes of the world on her, Starr has to decide: Will she say what happened that night? Will it matter?
","Wrenching, soul stirring, funny, endearing, painful, and frustratingly familiar, this novel offers a powerful look at a few weeks in a fairly typical teen girl's life -- with one horrific exception. Sure she worries about school, issues with friends, and her secret boyfriend, but she's lso the sole witness to the fatal shooting of her best friend by a police officer. In The Hate U Give, author Angie Thomas manages to bring humanity -- deep, emotionally binding, full-bodied humanity -- to the victims of police brutality and the families and friends they leave behind. The scenarios that revolve around the shooting are achingly routine -- unarmed African American, the media's push to blame the victim, a lax investigation, and a lack of charges or convictions. However, set against the backdrop of typical teen life, of community and family life, the consequences of the officer's actions and the actions others take after the tragedy take on a life and power beyond what any think piece or talking points on the subject could achieve. The characters in the book are rich, complex, and fully developed. They feel like family, friends, and neighbors, and they give those unfamiliar with life in urban centers an understanding that the setting may be specific but the human condition is the universal. The tragedy and triumph of Thomas' stellar work is that it's very real and heartbreakingly familiar. Teens will enjoy the book for its unfiltered look at life, death, grief, and social and political commentary, while parents and teachers will enjoy the book's well-written and thorough approach to a complex social issue.","Parents need to know that Angie Thomas' New York Times best-selling book The Hate U Give won  2018 Coretta Scott King Author Honor, a Michael L. Printz Honor, and the Oddysey Award for best audiobook for kids and teens. Inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, it involves the police shooting of an unarmed black teen. The book covers topics of race, interracial dating, political activism, grief, friendship, wealth disparity, police brutality, addiction, and the media's depiction of African Americans. Parents should be prepared to discuss recent and past instances of police shootings, how they were covered in the media, dealing with grief, and possible reactions to the trauma revealed in the book. There is some swearing, additional violence, sexual situations, and drug use in the book, but it's not gratuitous.

An Episode of Sparrows,"Lovely, moving literary classic set post-WWII.","In the bombed-out slums of London after WWII, Lovejoy lives with a restaurant owner and his wife while her mother travels as a singer. Little better than a street urchin, Lovejoy has grown up tough. But when she grabs an envelope from a sickly boy who found it on the street, something new enters her life.
The envelope contains a packet of seeds. In secret she plants a tiny garden in a vacant lot, but it's soon destroyed by the gang of boys who play there and don't allow girls. The leader of the gang, Tip, feels bad, though, and shows her a better place for her secret garden -- in the ruins of the local Catholic church. Thus begins a strange odyssey the two street children take together.
","AN EPISODE OF SPARROWS is beautifully moving, rich, and complex, filled with affectionate understanding of human beings in all their astounding variety. Every character, major and minor, is a fully fleshed-out creation. Though there's a deeply melancholy, even tragic, undercurrent, and Godden doesn't flinch from realism, she still manages to pull off an ending that is both absolutely believable and satisfying.
Rumer Godden originally published this as an adult novel. The New York Review of Books put out this reprint in 2007 for the author's centenary. There's nothing terribly inappropriate for children here, but the way it's told, involving insight into adult behavior and intricate shifting of viewpoint and time, may confuse inexperienced readers. Children who have read The Secret Garden probably can manage it.","Parents need to know that this is about London street children just after World War II. They smoke, drink, and fight, though it's mostly just referenced and not described.

"Insurgent: Divergent, Book 2","Excellent dystopian sequel is terrifically twisty, intense.","After surviving the horrors of the day the Erudite (intelligent) faction controlled the Dauntless (brave) to invade the Abnegation (selfless) compound and kill many of its members, a grieving Tris and Tobias travel with a small group to seek answers and allies among the other factions. With the help of Tris' brother, Caleb; Tobias' abusive father, Marcus; and the Dauntless friends they reunite with, Tris and Four discover that a key to stopping the Erudite from pursuing their goal of complete domination is to align themselves with the factionless, who aren't the starving and homeless they were thought to be but rather a highly organized and militarized group of outcasts led by someone with connections to Tobias. When Tris decides the only way to help the cause is to turn herself in to the Erudite, she doesn't realize that Tobias will stop at nothing to save her -- and their cause.
","Once again, Veronica Roth has created a pulse-quickening plot that delves further into the dysfunctional governing structure of factions that either collaborate or can't stand each other. In the tradition of second installments, Roth introduces in-depth exposition, new characters, seemingly unsurmountable challenges, and cliffhanger-level twists to move the story forward. The factionless folks are particularly fascinating, since as the literal outcasts of the book's highly stratified society, they're unpredictable and free thinking. It's also refreshing to have so many women as leaders, even though they have completely opposing agendas.
As in Divergent, INSURGENT centers on Tris, a beautifully flawed heroine much in the Katniss Everdeen (of The Hunger Games) mold of fierce and unflinchingly courageous young women. Unlike Katniss, however, Tris only has eyes for Tobias/Four, and he for her. Their intensely mature relationship far surpasses many of the superficial romances in young adult books. With a devotion and a certainty that belies their age, Tris and Tobias face each obstacle as equal partners who will do anything and everything to keep everyone safe in unthinkably dangerous world. ","Parents need to know that Insurgent -- the second installment in a  dystopian trilogy that began with the best-selling Divergent -- follows a brave young heroine and her equally fierce, devoted boyfriend. Like most thrillers set in a futuristic, fractured society, this sequel has a lot of fraught situations, violent encounters, deaths, and the constant threat that the protagonist or her boyfriend will be killed or injured. While the language is mild, this book ups the romance from a few kisses to several passionate make-out sessions and even a declaration of love. Some teens (considered of age in the book) drink, and Tris is slipped a drug that loosens her inhibitions and makes her giddy. Many characters are killed or hurt, but in the end, there are thought-provoking messages about the best way to ensure a peaceful but productive society.

Hattie Big Sky,Teen girl homesteads alone in Newbery Honor book.,"Set during World War I, HATTIE BIG SKY is about a teenager named Hattie, who has been passed from relative to relative since being orphaned as a small child. When she receives word that an uncle has left her a homesteading claim in Montana, she heads West alone. There she finds her new home is a shack, a Montana winter is setting in, and she has less than a year to fence the land, plant crops, and pay the fees, or else lose the claim. Hattie is warmly welcomed by her immediate neighbors, with whom she becomes fast friends. But she has a lot to battle: brutal weather, her own inexperience and loneliness, and bigoted locals who seek to punish those of German descent, their friends, and anyone they think is insufficiently patriotic.
","Readers will root for Hattie as she works until her hands blister -- she even passes out at one point -- and also exercises her heart to take care of those she loves. There are great details about life just after the turn of the 20th century, and readers will find out about quilting patterns, planting and harvesting, war rationing -- and even discover a couple of recipes. The author doesn't shy away from describing the hardships of homesteading life where so much depends on weather, neighbors, and the price of wheat -- or when a flu outbreak can kill people you love. But these details, like the anti-German harassment, are told at a level that young readers be able to understand and handle. Readers may surprised at the unpredictable ending, but that will only lead them excitedly to the sequel, Hattie Ever After, where Hattie's adventure continues.
 ","Parents need to know that Newbery Honor novel Hattie Big Sky is about a teenage orphan who moves to Montana after inheriting her uncle's homestead claim. The book gives readers a good sense of what life was like during World War I. In particular, Hattie watches neighbors of German descent face discrimination, including violence, though nothing worse than a barn-burning and a kick takes place here. Hattie is good-hearted and hardworking, and soon learns to stand up for what she believes in and the people she cares about, even when she puts herself in danger. Readers who enjoy this book may want to read the sequel, Hattie Ever After, published in 2013.

A Is for Amber Series,Amber's adventures have great messages for young readers.,"This first Amber Brown series, A IS FOR AMBER, helps young Amber navigate all kinds of situations that readers easily relate to. Amber is nervous about starting second grade, picks fights on a family vacation, has to figure out how to deal with a friend who has habits that annoy her, and encounters lots of other situations that come up in early elementary school. Amber's parents and friends are an integral part of every story.
","These books are fantastic for emerging readers, or for those who want to practice their skills while learning a bit more science and vocabulary than in typical chapter books for this age range. The Amber Brown series A Is for Amber is a fun -- occasionally deep -- take on life and friendship in early elementary school. In one of the books, Amber's parents have an argument, and Amber's worries are entirely relatable to children who have been upset by their own parents' rguments. On the positive side, there are birthday parties and lighthearted family trips and lots to laugh about, and each book ends with a lovely version of Amber telling herself that everything is going to be OK. It's a great message to kids about the complexity of life, told in ways that make sense to readers young and old.","Parents need to know that Paula Danziger's A Is for Amber series is about Amber Brown,  girl in early elementary school. It's written for very young readers but offers complexity in each 40-page story, the first of which is What a Trip, Amber Brown. The series is written in clear, concise language, with new vocabulary sprinkled amid familiar words and feelings. The stories about young Amber and her friends cover relatable topics -- fights with friends, problems at school, and being mad at siblings -- and Amber's parents and teachers help her with unending positivity. This is fabulous for emerging readers, and the books and topics are simpler than those in the related Amber Brown series for early readers, which starts when Amber is in third grade and follows her into middle school.

The Jewel Box Ballerinas,Gorgeously illustrated friendship fairy tale.,"Bibi Branchflower is so rich that she buys two of everything. But she doesn't have even one friend. When she buys a mysterious music box with two spinning ballerinas inside, her life begins to change.
","The most striking thing about this book are the gorgeous, detailed paintings that grace every page. A perfect complement to the melancholy fairy tale with an uplifting ending, the illustrations give kids lots to look at. Even the end papers dance with doubles that kids will want to scrutinize.
The marriage of story and illustrator here is superb. While Ana Juan's pictures would shine regardless of the text, the story is enhanced by the extremely stylized characters, somber colors, and mysterious details (the shopkeeper wearing his short fez, for example, and Bibi's big buttons).","Parents need to know that this is a magical tale of friendship.

The Adventures of Blue Avenger,Quirky book's mature content is best for teens.,"Secret champion of the underdog, modest seeker of truth, fearless innovator of the unknown! When teenager David dons a blue vest and headdress and changes his name to Blue Avenger, he becomes the unlikely hero of his high school. This witty tale of teen eccentricity, unlikely coincidences, and thoughtful musings keeps readers chuckling and wondering.
 ","Part comedy, part adventure, and part witty discourse on free will vs. determinism, this delightfully oddball romp is a breath of fresh air. Thought-provoking yet lighthearted, poignant, and at times hilarious, the story deliberately stretches credulity to show that there are no coincidences. The author takes the reader backstage, behind the scenes of Blue's life -- and of life in general. Skirting the edge of off-color humor (the book's knockout opening pages discuss the moment of Blue's conception in comically clinical terms), Norma Howe hooks the reader into a raucous philosophical dialogue in which events are traced backward to their unlikely -- and usually unknown -- causes, until all of life's events begin to seem like the most farfetched coincidences.
A book like this may get even the most reticent adolescent thinking and talking. This happily quirky way of looking at life is a tonic, renewing the reader's faith in the wonder and joy of our own little lives.","Parents need to know that some sexual content and language make this best for teens.

The Midnight Library,Little-girl librarian helps animal friends in sweet story.,"A little-girl librarian and her three owl helpers assist other animals in THE MIDNIGHT LIBRARY, which is open only from ""midnight to dawn."" When the squirrel band plays loudly, they're ushered into the activity room. When a wolf is discovered crying in the stacks, they encourage her to keep reading until the happy ending. When a turtle still has 500 pages to read, they issue him a library card so he can finish his book at home. And, when the sun comes up, the little librarian reads a last, bedtime story to her now-very-sleepy owl assistants.
","Both the illustrations and the story in The Midnight Library are full of charm. The bold, blocky art is strikingly eye-catching. The little-girl librarian is charmingly pigtailed.

Twisted,Gritty but powerful read about bullied teen.,"After years of being an unnoticed dweeb, Tyler gets noticed in high school when he spray-paints graffiti on the school. He also gets arrested and sentenced to a summer of community service, from which he earns a newly muscular physique from the labor, and a reputation as slightly dangerous.
For a while things are OK for Tyler: he is no longer afraid of bullies, and the hottest girl in school (daughter of his father's boss and sister of the worst bully) seem interested in him. But his father is verbally abusive, his mother an alcoholic, all of the adults in his life are suspicious of him, and the bullies are looking for a chance for revenge. And when his life spirals out of his control, he begins to think that his only options are the most drastic ones.
","At first, you'll think you've seen this before; but then you start to notice some intriguing differences. The dweeb is buff and has a police record, some of the adults actually seem to care, the siblings like each other, the little sister has a good head on her shoulders, and the teenaged main character has become an adult before he or any of the other characters have noticed. And it's not much longer before you're completely swept up into a story with powerful emotional resonance, in which the protagonist may actually see a light at the end of the tunnel before the reader does.
Author Laurie Anderson does a good job with her first try at getting inside the head of a boy and speaking in his voice. Everything rings true here, and Tyler has more than earned the sympathy of the reader long before he is pushed beyond what anyone should have to deal with. It's a terrific thing, and all too rare, to see a protagonist develop hard-won strength of character right before your eyes.","Parents need to know that the main character must deal with school bullies.

Miracle on 133rd Street,Neighbors come together in lively urban Christmas tale.,"A Puerto Rican family in New York is in their small apartment preparing for their Christmas Eve celebration when Mami discovers the roast is too big for the oven. What will they do? Papi and young son Jose put the roast in a big box and take it to ""Regular Ray's Pizzeria"" to see if they can use Mr. Ray's big pizza oven. On the way out, as they pass the apartments in their four-floored walk-up, neighbors open their doors to express the things they don't like about the holidays: shopping for gifts, spending too much money, muggers on the streets, snow. After the roast gets cooked in the pizza oven, they invite kind Mr. Ray to join them for dinner, and he brings cannolis for dessert. As the three carry the roast back to the apartment building through the snow, its swirling aroma seems to magically put people in a good mood. Now when they pass the apartments, their neighbors open their doors at the delicious smell, and Papi invites them to dinner, too. They add their own contributions, including the Santiagos, who bring guitars for singing carols. No more complaining -- everyone is full of Christmas cheer as they enjoy the feast together, all fitting in the tiny apartment: ""It's a miracle,"" says Mami.
","With a light touch and exuberant art, this urban Christmas tale shows neighbors coming together to forget their troubles and share a feast. It's told through the eys of sensitive, upbeat young Jose, who notices how every Christmas his mother gets homesick for Puerto Rico. He also notes the holiday complaints of the building's ethnically diverse residents -- the Santiagos, the Wozenskys, the DiPalmas, Mr. Franklin, and Mrs. Whitman.
The relationships among family members, neighbors, and shopkeepers are charming. And the openness and generosity that build s the story goes on is inspiring.

His mother reminds him how patient his sisters have been with his choices, but he refuses -- he doesn't like stories with kissing and tights. Instead, Skippy heads into his closet and emerges in a dark forest. He soon runs into his friends, Los Chimichangos, who say he must rescue Nieve Qué by kissing her. They help him battle a dragon and -- to his dismay -- dress him in tights, which are requisite for the part of the prince.

The Right Word: Roget and His Thesaurus,Engaging picture-book intro to word-loving thesaurus author.,"After his father's death, young Peter Roget travels with his family to London. Frequently uprooted as the family moves, he has few friends but loves books nd soon starts making lists of everything he encounters, especially words (starting with the Latin ones his tutor teaches him, along with their English counterparts). As he grows up, pursuing his interests and studying hard, he eventually becomes a doctor, travels, and frequently lectures to learned audiences who admire his inventions, such as a portable chess set. Then the book of word lists he compiled in his youth becomes a best seller -- nd remains one to this day.
","THE RIGHT WORD is a richly illustrated biography of famed thesaurus author Peter Mark Roget. Not every kid, especially in the early-reader set, is going to be as fired up as young Peter about choosing the right word and compiling knowledge, with passages such as, ""If only all the ideas in the world could be found in one place, then everyone would have one book where they could find the best word, the one that really fit. Peter carried this idea with him like a secret treasure."" And the whole concept of a thesaurus may fall flat with readers not quite ready for it. But kids who already love words (or making lists) will be in heaven, and even those who don't will relate to the tale of a shy, studious boy who starts to make lists to remember his late father, becomes a doctor at 19, and goes on to become friends with some of the 19th century's great scientists.

The topic may seem above the level of the picture-book audience, but there's a lot going on here that's easily accessible. You don't have to share young Peter Roget's obsessive interest in list-making and categorization to be intrigued by the relatable tale of a shy, studious, fatherless boy who's interested in everything, who started making lists at 8, and who by 19 had graduated from medical school. Appealing illustrations densely packed with lists and notes, as well as supplemental resources in the back of the book, invite repeat visits and new discoveries.

Now kicked out of school, he's surprised to learn that the enemy operatives at SPYDER have a job for him, offering lots of money. The trouble is, he'll have to betray everyone he's ever cared about at Spy School.
","EVIL SPY SCHOOL carries on the series' tradition of combining jokes, smarts, and action, including typically cinematic fight scenes, explosions, and near-death experiences. Here, Ben Ripley is finally lured to the dark side, and fans of the earlier books will enjoy more of the same wit, suspense, and double-crossing of the earlier books. This book is a little less of a page-turner, as Ben spends much more time getting his bearings with SPYDER than charging into action as in previous books.
The violence is kept to a plot-moving but not-graphic minimum, and Gibbs get points for his commitment to gender balance: Here, two teen girls have extraordinary smarts and power, and one of them even gets to be evil.

However, it often upends expectations to show that spying is decidedly less glamorous than it looks in the movies nd that problem solving and smarts are essential to survival. As the teen spies fight bad guys, crack codes, and uncover secret missions, their biggest mission is learning to trust one another and develop a sense of ethics against the lure of weapons, gadgets, and the promise of lots of money.

"The Battlemage: Summoner, Book 3",High-action demon battles thrill in trilogy finale.,"In THE BATTLEMAGE, after Fletcher, Sylva, Othello, Cress, and Alice escape from the Orcs into the ether with their demons, they know the danger is far from over. They've landed in the parallel world full of the demons and won't be able to stay alive in the noxious gases without a steady supply of special plant petals they discovered at the Orcs' temple. Unless the ether is much smaller than they think, they'll need to find more petals before they get to an exit portal on the Hominum side -- if they can find one. Also, predators lurk all around: both the larger demons of the ether and the Orcs who cross over into the ether to try to recapture them, flying on their giant Wyverns. The odds of Fletcher and friends making it out of the ether are not good, but what awaits them back home drives them on. The big war with the Orcs rages on, and everyone is needed at the front lines. And Fletcher has offered a new home to the villagers of his hometown in the long-abandoned estate of Raleighshire, the family home he only just learned was his. He needs to train up soldiers to defend it before the Orcs invade.
","This trilogy capper (but not series end) takes time to get rolling, but when it does, readers are in for a runaway epic demon-battle thrill. It's exciting at first to find the brave Fletcher and friends in the demon world from Page 1 of The Battlemage, riding on a giant demon, having no idea how they will find their way out again. But the excitement wanes as the chapters drag on -- 21 of them. Not that there aren't flying demons and crazy tentacled demons and Orcs to fight, but readers are missing that sense of grounding in the story as a whole.
When Fletcher and friends are finally home again, the nail-biting starts. Everything has to go right or they're all doomed -- good vs. evil done right. The political conspiracy subplot weaves well into the overall tension. And when Fletcher trains up his soldiers and resettles his refugees, it's always engaging (these are parts in stories that usually drag). And then the battles begin and you're on a runaway train until almost the very end. Readers who crave nonstop action are in for a huge treat.","Parents need to know that The Battlemage is the third book in the Summoner series featuring a world of demons, humans, Orcs, elves, dwarves, gremlins, and goblins. Like in the first two books, there's tension among the races. In Book 2, The Inquisition, we're caught up in the drama of the evil Orcs. In The Battlemage, prideful and power-hungry humans are shown as the other enemy to peace. They plot to divide the races in animosity when the Orcs can only be defeated if everyone works together. We're spared the mass sacrifices and blood rituals of Book 2, but there's still much battle violence. Two lengthy back-to-back battles at the end show many deaths on both sides from gunfire, close combat with poleaxes and blades, demon attacks, and fiery magic. Expect much blood flowing (with some decapitations), friends being mourned if they're too far gone to be magically healed, and a necklace of goblin ears -- a war trophy -- flaunted as an intimidation tactic. A few more skirmishes involve magic, fire, demon attacks, arrows, and injuries, and there's the graphic description of the hunting and butchering of a demon for food. There's a bit of older-teen drinking, some swearing that doesn't go beyond ""bloody hell,"" and a few quick romantic kisses.

"Around America to Win the Vote: Two Suffragists, a Kitten, and 10,000 Miles","Two women stump for right to vote in fresh, upbeat story.","AROUND AMERICA TO WIN THE VOTE: TWO SUFFRAGISTS, A KITTEN, AND 10,000 MILES tells the true story of Nell Richardson and Alice Burke, two New York suffragists who in 1916 drove a car to California and back to publicize the campaign to win ""Votes for Women."" Since the car was open and there were few paved roads, the journey was physically challenging, involving blizzards, getting hauled out of mud by mules, and shot at by the Rio Grande. Along the way, they gave speeches from the car, attended events with supporters, and even joined a circus parade, all the while scoring publicity for the suffrage movement. When they reached California, they were presented with a medal, then circled back across the northern states. An afterword sets their journey in the context of the larger historical suffrage movement, which culminated in the 19th Amendment in 1920, granting women the vote.
","This story of two women with can-do spirit who drive cross-country in 1916 to proclaim and fight for women's right to vote is an exciting adventure story celebrating lesser-known suffragists. Around America to Win the Vote: Two Suffragists, a Kitten, and 10,000 Miles focuses less on hostile opposition and more on physical roadblocks during the journey -- blizzards and muddy roads. Hadley Hooper's rt is as upbeat as Mara Rockliff's text, bathed in  sunny yellow that the afterword makes clear was the color of the movement.
The two women are indomitable, smiling even as they're up to their high-button shoes in mud. As they join a circus parade in Georgia and smuggle their cat into ""a fine hotel in New Orleans,"" the book feels joyous, and a reminder that it was a short 100 years ago that women successfully fought for and won the right to vote.","Parents need to know that Around America to Win the Vote: Two Suffragists, a Kitten, and 10,000 Miles, by Mara Rockliff and illustrated by Hadley Hooper, is the fascinating true tale of two intrepid women who drove cross country in 1916 to build support for women's suffrage, a surging movement that won women the right to vote in 1920. The book has the lively feel of an adventure story, and the women are fun and savvy -- sneaking their cat into an upscale hotel, giving speeches from their car along the way. The art is as charming and colorful as its subjects, and the women's story brings the period and movement to light.

Likely Story,"Light, soapy summer read about a teen soap writer.","Mallory's life with her soap star mother is as unreal as the plot lines on her mother's show. One day, on a fluke, and after another huge fight with her mom, Mallory blogs about how unreal soaps can be and how she would write a better, smarter soap. When she's given the opportunity to do just that, she's jazzed. All she has to do is be successful, cast her best friend in the lead role, balance her life with her boyfriend who already has a girlfriend, and keep her mother off her back. Easy right?
","LIKELY STORY has a fun concept. The daughter of a soap opera star is writing a ""realistic soap opera"" about teens. The real story is not the soap, but the real life drama Mallory has to handle. Unfortunately, the book seems to be one big set-up for the sequel. Readers are left with flat, one dimensional characters that don't develop well enough for readers to care about any of them. Also the plot twists are predictable, readers will see Mallory's mom's power trip from a mile away.
Mallory delivers some pretty funny lines and the banter between the characters is, at times, giggle worthy. She's insightful, funny, and quick-witted, a great narrator. There may not be amnesia or alien abductions in this fast-paced novel, like you'd find on Mallory mother's show, but the story is grounded in soap opera reality -- right down to a blow-out argument that ends with someone falling into a pool.","Parents need to know that there's a fair amount of swearing, some make-out sessions, poor parental influence, and brand names in this novel. However, it's milder and less malicious than other teen fare like the Gossip Girl books.

"A Babysitter's Guide to Monster Hunting, Book 1",Babysitters fight monsters in fun horror-lite tale.,"In A BABYSITTER'S GUIDE TO MONSTER HUNTING, first-time babysitter Kelly fails to stop monstrous Toadies from kidnapping little Jacob, whose nightmares are so strong they come to life. In desperation, she calls Jacob's regular babysitter, Liz, who turns out to be a part of a secret society of monster-hunting babysitters. Liz lets Kelly tag along as the local babysitters crew search for him. They discover that the Toadies are in league with the Boogeyman, who plans to harness the power of kids like Jacob to turn the world into a never-ending, monster-populated living nightmare. All seems lost when Liz is carried away into the night sky by the Boogeyman and the other babysitters fall into the mouth of a giant octopus. Kelly must face her fear and self-doubt to have any hope of saving little Jacob, her friends, and really, the world.
","This funny and creepy book has all the elements of a great Halloween read for older kids. Kelly and the monster-hunting babysitters are all impressive in their own right, and have moments of fear and doubt like real people. And illustrations by Vivienne To add to the fun. The scary scenes in A Babysitter's Guide to Monster Hunting are quite scary -- with monsters abducting terrified children and trying to kill the babysitters -- but also pretty tame in their fantasy violence, with little blood or gore. Most appealing to middle grade readers, perhaps, is that really young kids, tweens, and teens are the only hope for saving the world.
Yet, Kelly falls flat at times, reverting to boy crazy and self-interested when it's not appropriate. And the story fails its two characters of color, who seem like they are there to check the diversity box. While one is more developed and complex than the other, neither ends up feeling fully realized or authentic. Excessive product mentions (including Jansport, Facebook, Uggs, Instagram, Amazon, Reef sandals, SpongeBob SquarePants, and more) mar what is otherwise a fun and spooky read.","Parents need to know that Joe Ballarini's A Babysitter's Guide to Monster Hunting, which is the first book in a trilogy and is being adapted for a Netflix movie, tells the story of Kelly, an average 13-year old, who fails to prevent the kid she's babysitting from being abducted by monsters. A secret society of monster-butt-kicking babysitters converge on the case, and Kelly discovers her own demon-fighting powers as she tags along. Positive messages of being true to yourself and doing what's right shine brighter than the doubts and meanness characters occasionally share (with insults like ""idiot,"" ""weird""). There's mostly tame fantasy violence with little to no blood. Relatable main and supporting characters show courage in the face of danger. Most characters are White; a Black girl is described a bit stereotypically, and another character, from Guatemala, is largely objectified as Kelly's crush. They almost kiss but are interrupted. There are scary and suspenseful scenes, so it's best for tweens who don't frighten easily and enjoy these kinds of stories.

"Immortal Guardians: Spirit Animals: Fall of the Beasts, Book 1",Exciting -- and creepy -- start to spin-off fantasy series.,"In IMMORTAL GUARDIANS, the three young heroes of Erdas -- Connor, Abeke, and Rollan -- summon the fourth, Meilin, back from her home in Zhong, for a very good reason: The greatest of the spirit animal guardians are being stolen by Zerif, an old and dangerous foe, as soon as they're reborn. No one's sure how he's turning the animals against the humans they bond with, but they suspect it has to do with a symbol that seems carved into their foreheads. It's a symbol that Kovo the ape, a newly reborn and dangerous spirit animal saved from Zerif, draws over and over, along with a door. When the four heroes find a picture of the same door in a history book, they know they need to follow where it leads. But there's also word of another spirit animal guardian needing protection from Zerif. The four kids decide to split up. Rollan and Abeke set off to find the guardian and stop Zerif. And Meilin and Connor follow Kovo the ape to a mysterious door leading to an underground world that history forgot, where scary zombie-like creatures have the same ominous symbol on their foreheads.  
","There's not a dull moment in this exciting series start featuring the ready-made heroes from the first Spirit Animals series, who split up to tackle very different but equally difficult tasks. Rolland and Abeke set out to confront the enemy they know, though they don't know the source of his newfound power, and Meilin and Connor discover the unknown, and quite creepy, enemy underground. The two story lines are a great contrast and set up many possibilities for future adventures, which is what the start of every long-running series strives for.
 ","Parents need to know that Immortal Guardians is the first book in the Fall of the Beasts spin-off series that picks up at the end of the original, highly popular Spirit Animals series, and it is similarly multimedia and multi-author. There's a website where young readers can choose their own spirit animals and character identities nd enter codes from the books they read to unlock prizes and whatnot. Each book is by a different children's author, and books are released every few months, starting in August 2015. Both Spirit Animals series are set up for animal-loving tween readers just digging into fantasy books, and it's much easier to read Immortal Guardians if you've read the other series. Prepare for a bit more scariness and creepiness from this book than in stories past. One of the main characters panics when she's enclosed in a small space in a pitch-dark cave, then attacked by hordes of zombie-like creatures who bite and claw. These creatures are victims of a parasitic worm that travels under the skin until it reaches the forehead and takes over their minds. The main characters battle it out with them and with large animals, enduring a few serious injuries while bravely defending one another. Bravery and teamwork remain the strongest assets of the four diverse tween characters at the heart of the two series.

"Beauty and the Beak: How Science, Technology, and a 3D-Printed Beak Rescued a Bald Eagle","Amazing bird rescue tale shows teamwork, high-tech science.","BEAUTY AND THE BEAK: HOW SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND A 3D-PRINTED BEAK RESCUED A BALD EAGLE follows the journey of a wild bald eagle in Alaska, later named Beauty, that grows from egg to 4-year-old bird, at which point she's suddenly shot, her beak shattered, and she falls from her tree. Due to her injuries, she can't fly to hunt for food and is found by police when she's trying to find scraps at a landfill. She's taken to a local wildlife center, and then Idaho raptor biologist Jane Veltkamp brings her to Birds of Prey Northwest, the wildlife center she founded in Northern Idaho. There Veltkamp teams up with an engineer to create a prosthetic beak nd a dentist, who helps attach it to Beauty. The bird survives nd still lives at the wildlife center (unable to return to the wild because she still needs help from humans), and her real beak is slowly growing back.
","This riveting survival story gives kids a close-up view of science and technology in service of wildlife. Beauty and the Beak tells one amazing story of a bird and the problem-solving raptor biologist who saves her, but offers lots more information in sidebars filled with facts, figures  -- and feathers! -- that spotlight practical issues such as ""How You Can Help"" nd ""Endangered No Longer,"" which outlines the successful results of conservation efforts. The book won the 2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science/Subaru Children's Science Book Prize nd the the 2017 California Reading Association Eureka! Gold Award for nonfiction children's books.
The abundant color photos of eagles in the wild and Beauty's progress and treatment will draw kids in. The text is crystal clear and easy for kids to grasp, with specialized scientific vocabulary defined. And the main story of Beauty is beautifully told, with drama and suspense. Even the most graphic passage -- about Beauty's injury -- is told poetically: ""Suddenly a crash like lightning and thunder split the air! The eagle's face burned. She couldn't see. Her talons lost their grip and the tree seemed to spin around her. She fell to the ground, stunned. The sun was still high in the sky, but the eagle's world went dark. A bullet had shattered her beak. Her eye was torn and her face was bleeding. It even hurt for her to breathe. The eagle lay on the ground for days, too weak to move.""","Parents need to know that Beauty and the Beak: How Science, Technology, and a 3D-Printed Beak Rescued a Bald Eagle, is n award-winning, picture-filled nonfiction book by science writer and children's book author Deborah Lee Rose nd raptor biologist Jane Veltkamp. It tells the engaging story of how Veltkamp worked with an engineer and a dentist to save n Alaskan bald eagle named Beauty, whose beak was shattered by a bullet. The main text tells the riveting story of a young eagle growing up, nearly dying from injury and starvation, being rescued by local police and then healed at Veltkamp's Idaho wildlife center, where it received an artificial (""prosthetic"") beak. Informative sidebars add loads of information about bald eagles, the need to protect them, and what you can do to help. Large color photos by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service help tell the story. Description of the imagined moment Beauty is shot is brief and poetic but graphic (""Her eye was torn and her face was bleeding."") and could be disturbing to young or sensitive readers.

Hunted,Strong hunter-girl Beauty takes on Beast in this retelling.,"In HUNTED, Yeva and her two older sisters live a prosperous life in a small village thanks to their successful merchant father. Yeva spends her days visiting with a baronessa and her evenings baking bread and telling stories by the fire with her family. Life changes abruptly, however, when Yeva's father's latest business venture tanks -- a caravan of goods is stolen on a dangerous road and all his men are killed. With investors to pay, the family settles some debts by selling the village house and most of their things and moving to the father's small hunting cabin in the woods. Yeva is the only one of the sisters who takes to the rustic change of scenery. As a young girl, she used to hunt with her father and is eager to help provide for her family during the long winter. At first Yeva's father insists his daughter stay a lady and refuses her help. But as he embarks on longer outings in the woods, probing deeper into the forest for a creature whose head, he claims, will yield a hefty sum, the sisters need the food Yeva brings in. And when her father's hunting dog returns to the cabin without her father, Yeva employs her hunting skills to track him down. As she ventures deeper into the forest, desperate for any clues, she has the strong sense she's being followed -- of being hunted herself.
","This Russian-set update to the ""tale as old as time"" stays true to the drama of the star-crossed nature of it all while adding a healthy dose of modern girl power to the main character. Yeva, nicknamed Beauty, is an avid hunter and a survivor in Hunted. Her idea of a good time is tracking game in the woods by herself all day -- let's hear it for introverts.
She's a dangerous foe for the Beast as well, intent on getting revenge for her father's death. Having her move from all-out rage against the Beast to a place of empathy makes author Meagan Spooner's job tough, but she mostly manages to make the transition believable, all while exploring the dueling natures of the Beast himself through cursive diary-like entries between the chapters. Despite a slight drag near the end, this old story feels freshened up and empowered.","Parents need to know that Hunted is a retelling of the Beauty and the Beast tale by Meagan Spooner, the author of the Skylark and Starbound trilogies. Expect the violence to be less than in those series, but it's jarring and often life-threatening to the main characters, Yeva/Beauty and Beast. Yeva finds her father in pieces in the woods. There's a near drowning, an arrow to a lung, and a slit throat. Sensitive animal lovers beware: A beloved dog breaks a leg in a fight, and much hunting is described, down to skinning and gutting the animals. Beyond that the mature content is at a minimum: a few kisses, some cordial and brandy drunk in celebration. Readers can compare this more feminist version of the classic tale with others they've read or seen. Yeva is a skilled hunter who rejects the traditional gender roles of the time and bravely protects her family.

"Divided We Fall, Book 1",Provocative military tale asks tough patriotism questions.,"When high-school senior and star football player Daniel Wright enlists in the National Guard, he swears to protect the president of the United States and the governor of Idaho. He doesn't expect to be called upon to carry a weapon into a riot in Boise, which turns out to be a disaster. Back home with his panic attack-prone mother and devoted girlfriend, JoBell, Daniel finds himself in the middle of a deadly skirmish between the state of Idaho and the federal government. Soon, his friends and fellow townspeople are taking sides for and against him. What will he do when the president and the governor both order him to attack the other?
","DIVIDED WE FALL asks tough questions about loyalty and patriotism but refuses to offer any easy answers. It thrusts protagonist Daniel Wright into the middle of an armed conflict, a precarious position made worse by his naivete and impulsiveness. Author Trent Reedy has a strong grip on military procedure, and the battle scenes he depicts are suitably realistic, chaotic, and devoid of false heroics. Engaged readers will enjoy debating whether Daniel makes the right choices and what he might have done to avoid the heartache that befalls him. ","Parents need to know that Divided We Fall is a hard-hitting, realistic depiction of what might happen if a state such as Idaho faced off against the federal government. National Guardsman Daniel Wright, the protagonist, is committed to the oaths he's sworn to his state and nation, but his convictions sometimes lead to misery for others. A half-dozen party scenes depict underage drinking, in which Daniel and his girlfriend JoBell participate. The language is rough but realistic, with frequent use of ""damn,"" ""hell,"" ""s--t,"" and ""a--hole,"" and occasional use of ""p---y,"" ""d--k,"" ""bitch,"" ""bastard,"" and ""pissed."" Daniel and JoBell clearly have a sexually intimate relationship, but the book gives no details. Realistic gun violence plays a big part in the narrative, with characters shot to death in two scenes.

"Specials: Uglies Quartet, Book 3","Popular sci-fi series bounces back with action, depth.","Tally's not just any Pretty anymore. She's a Special, along with her frenemy, Shay. They're charged with hunting down the city's runaways and, if they're worthy, turning them into more Specials. Tally feels like she finally belongs, but nothing is the same without her boyfriend, Zane, left in New Pretty Town with his damaged brain and tremors after taking the wrong Pretty cure. Maybe if Zane were to run away again, he'd be made Special, too. But Zane's not going anywhere: He's collared like a dog with metal too strong to break without better tools. On impulse, Tally and Shay break into the armory to find the right equipment, unleashing a chain of events that threatens the cure, the runaways, and everything else.
","Way to bounce back -- where Pretties (book 2) was lacking in excitement and plot twists, SPECIALS delivers. Tally is again put to the test mentally, trying to regain her own sense of self after yet another mind-altering operation. But thanks to her body rebuilt for danger, she's also got some truly fast-paced, nail-biting action scenes. It's a good balance of thoughtful and ""icy,"" as the Specials would say.
Westerfeld's future world opens up, too, exploring what happens in a city with more freedoms and an ever-expanding immigrant population. This is the depth the series needed to keep it special -- and expand it into its final installment.","Parents need to know that Specials -- super-humans wired with an impulse problem and a superiority complex -- are essentially dangerous weapons always doing dangerous things like jumping off cliffs, crashing hover boards, and setting off massive explosions. As kind of a clique thing, they also engage in cutting themselves with knives to feel more ""icy"" (focused and in the moment). This behavior is eventually deemed unhealthy and sworn off by Tally, the main character, who is a positive role model in a number of other ways as well. That makes it almost worse to see Tally endure the death of character close to her, be unjustly imprisoned, and almost go under the knife while (yikes) still awake.

Thanks to extensive research, including into atypical texts, readers learn details about Cleopatra's family, her childhood, her reign, and her powerful enemies that may have been missing from more conventional histories. The book dispels myths while teaching kids what life was like for a typical teen queen -- complete with makeup tips, boy gossip, and deploying enormous armies.
","History is cool again in this hip, fun exploration into the life of Queen Cleopatra. Life as a teen pharaoh isn't all it's cracked up to be. Thousands of years of innuendo, bad PR, and Hollywood versions of her story have painted her as a conniving tramp, when the real story is much more exciting and refreshing. Kids should be hooked from the first glance at its glamorous, edgy cover. Sidebars, graphics, bright photos, and slang enliven the text. Heavy on metaphors, such as, “[they] trash-talked her worse than feuding starlets at a Hollywood club,” the language won't be everyone's cup of tea, but it will resonate with kids and reluctant readers. Amid the fluff and contempo tone, the information is solid and well-researched, and extensive footnotes and sources are provided for those interested in learning more about Egypt's famous queen.","Parents need to know that this informal history, peppered with puns and teen slang, features mystery, fights, death, murder, suicide, brother-sister marriage, drunks -- typical fare for a biographical look at an ancient ruler. There is nothing questionable in the book that isn't seen in mainstream media. In fact, it's relatively tame considering what currently appears in much tween/teen entertainment.

Moon Over Manifest,"Girl finds meaning of home in nostalgic, robust tale.","After riding the rails and traveling around with her father for most of her life, 12-year-old Abilene is sent back to the town of Manifest, Kansas, to spend the summer living with an old friend of her dad's. At first, she is confused, defensive, and a bit rough-and-tumble abrasive. Her life has been anything but normal up to this point, and she really has no clue about where she should call home. Is it a real place like Manifest? Or is ""it not down in any map; true places never are"" (a quote from Moby Dick that pops up several times throughout the book). But things quickly begin working out for her. She forms a spy club with some new friends she meets, and they spend the summer unraveling the mysteries of the town, flushed out by stories people tell them, hidden letters -- and a relationship Abilene forms with a Hungarian woman who professes to be from a family of diviners. In the process, Abilene learns about her own father's history, and finds a real home.
","This intriguing story weaves a number of different threads together to create a world that is both believable and mysterious. The characters are an assortment of unique individuals -- from a Hungarian woman with a bit of magic to the spirited protagonist -- each with his or her own story to tell, and life with them in Manifest is both nostalgic and fascinating at the same time. Readers will have no trouble connecting with Abilene, since most tweens and teens are trying to find out where they fit in this world just like she is. The flashbacks let her story unfold in a creative way, making this a good resource for teaching storytelling or fiction writing. Historical details about World War I and the Great Depression, as well as the author's list of resources, offer further opportunities for educational exploration.","Parents need to know that this Newbery Medal winner tells a nostalgic, robust story that takes place during the Great Depression (1936) with a secondary story that flashes back to the era of World War I (1917-1918).  There's some violence: One man is stabbed and killed, one loses his foot in an animal trap, a soldier is hit by shrapnel, many people die of influenza, and the KKK burns a cross in front of a German meeting hall. But Abilene is a smart, courageous protagonist who not only finds her home in this moving story, but also helps her new community work through its problems.

The Navigator,Time fantasy is occasionally exciting.,"Owen likes to play near an abandoned Workhouse above his town, and he has a secret cave nearby. With his father gone and his mother deep in depression, he likes to hang out there. But one day he comes out of his cave to find the Workhouse swarming with people, but his house, indeed his entire town, has vanished.
Soon he finds out that evil beings called the Harsh have reversed time, that the Workhouse is an island in time, and that the people there, called Resisters, sleep through the centuries and awaken when needed to fight the Harsh. Owen himself has a part to play in defeating the Harsh and setting time back on its normal course. But he's not sure whom he can trust, and some of the Resisters don't trust him -- they believe that his father was a traitor, and Owen may be too.
","Adult author Eoin McNamee pens an intermittently exciting variation on an archetypal fantasy theme for his first children's book. The details are imaginative, but unclear. Who the Harsh are, where the Resisters came from, how it all works -- none of this is really explained. This might be less noticeable if the characters were more compelling, but they're mostly flat and interchangeable.
The ending is even more mystifying than the rest of the story. The action is fun at times, though it sometimes drags, and there are hints that there might be more backstory than the author is letting on. This is intended to be the first of a series, but it doesn't leave the reader panting for more. It might appeal to fantasy fanatics who have run out of more compelling fare.","Parents need to know that there's some fantasy violence, with injuries, deaths, kidnapping, and references to a parent who's supposed to have committed suicide (he didn't).

The rest of the pirate cookies are set aside for Santa Claus to eat. After Jim goes to sleep, Captain Cookie sets off to round up his crew and rescue them from being devoured by their mysterious enemy. But when the cookies finally encounter Santa Claus, fear is replaced by wonder and joy as the gingerbread crew receives a most magical gift.
","The strength of this sweet fantasy is the watercolor and gouache illustrations by Matt Tavares. He presents the story mostly from the perspective of a gingerbread cookie, exploring a nighttime setting cloaked in mystery and drama. The crumbling cookies’ frosted expressions melt to fear and dismay as they prepare to face Santa Claus in the shadows, then turn to wary trepidation as they follow Santa to learn about Christmas.
	Unfortunately, the serviceable text doesn’t live up to the imaginative premise or the handsome illustrations. It feels rushed and flat, and relies heavily on the artwork to explain key plot points. But kids won’t mind, and they’ll enjoy following Captain Cookie as he step-taps about with his toothpick peg leg. The oversized pages and large print make this a good choice for reading aloud to a group.
Artwork makes great use of perspective and captures the magic of home on Christmas Eve.","Parents need to know there is nothing to be concerned about in this book.

"The Last Dragonslayer: The Chronicles of Kazam, Book 1",Talky but funny fantasy takes a while to get going.,"Fifteen-year-old foundling Jennifer Strange runs Kazam Mystical Arts Management, keeping track of a motley team of magicians who've been reduced to unblocking drains and rewiring homes due to a lack of magical energy to draw on. But Big Magic may be about to reappear in the world, and various psychics have begun to predict the death of the last dragon. No one know who the last dragonslayer is fated to be, but two nations are willing to go to war to claim the lands once inhabited by the magical lizard.
","The tone of this book will be familiar to anyone who's read Jasper Fforde's absurdist fantasies for adults, but it's not a tone that translates particularly well to the YA market. Digressive and discursive, The Last Dragonslayer seems to take forever to drop into gear. Once it does, there are some intriguing plot developments, but it may be too little too late for some readers.","Parents need to know that Japer Fforde'sThe Last Dragonslayer is the first book in The Chronicles of Kazam series. It's a somewhat slow-moving and rather talky but humorous fantasy adventure about magicians concerned with finding the last dragonslayer and witnessing the return of Big Magic. There's little violence until the tale's climax, when a couple of likeable characters meet their individual fates. There's virtually no objectionable content and plenty of absurdist humor.

We Had to Be Brave: Escaping the Nazis on the Kindertransport,"Must-read true story of courage, heroism, and heartbreak.","WE HAD TO BE BRAVE: ESCAPING THE NAZIS ON THE KINDERTRANSPORT opens as the Nazis start their rise to power and anti-Semitism begins to take a violent hold in Germany. Life for Jewish families (even those who were not religious and felt integrated into their communities) would soon be forever changed. Told primarily through the eyes of the children who would be rescued by the Kindertransport, the book recounts how Jewish families began to be treated differently (and often cruelly) by friends, schoolmates, and neighbors and how intense hatred toward Jews soon became the new normal. Parents lost their jobs and fathers were sometimes arrested and sent to detention camps. Synagogues and businesses were burned as neighbors stood by and watched, doing nothing to help. Students were harassed and threatened by classmates and finally expelled from their schools. By 1938, as Jewish families became desperate to flee, nations (including the U.S.) began closing their doors. But the British government agreed to welcome 10,000 children and volunteer groups began to organize a massive rescue mission. Some children came alone, others with siblings. They were placed with foster families and in youth hostels and had to adjust to a new language, new food, and sometimes life with a non-Jewish family. Communication with the families they'd left behind was difficult or nonexistent and at the war's end, many would learn their entire family had perished in the Holocaust. A back-of-the-book section that shares what happened to the children and rescuers whose stories are told in the book.
 ","Told through the eyes of the children who lived it, the story offers readers a chance to imagine themselves in the midst of an often overlooked chapter in history. We Had to Be Brave also serves as a call for readers to themselves be brave -- to stand up against bullying and hatred based solely on someone's religion or ethnicity and to treat others with compassion and fairness.","Parents need to know that Deborah Hopkinson's We Had to Be Brave: Escaping the Nazis on the Kindertransport tells the true stories of some of the 10,000 children from Nazi occupied countries who were rescued and sent to Great Britain during 1938 and 1939. (There are a few mentions of kids who were sheltered in France, but theh focus here is on those sent to Great Britain.) Using interviews, memoirs and letters, Hopkinson paints a vivid and sometimes terrifying portrait of life for Jews in Europe as the Nazis rose to power, the heartbreak of parents making the decision to send their children to safety as they stayed behind, and the courage of children who found themselves suddenly alone in a new country. Synagogues and Jewish homes, businesses, schools, and hospitals are burned and looted and innocent people are beaten and shot. Nazi Storm Troopers march through a town singing, ""And when Jewish blood spurts from the knife then all is really well."" Some children learn the fate of families who stayed behind: that they died in extermination camps or were rounded up and shot. Although the publisher has imed the book at ages 8-12, but the violent historical content may be more suited to kids 10 and up. The gripping story and dozens of archival photos make it a compelling and important read for teens and parents, as well.

"Fragments: The Partials Sequence, Book 2",Kira tracks creators of super-soldiers in exciting sequel.,"FRAGMENTS picks right up where Partials left off, with 16-year-old medic-in-training Kira Marshall on her own in an abandoned Manhattan and searching for answers about who created the super-soldier Partials and RM, the virus that decimated the human race. The more she learns about ParaGen, the corporation responsible, the more questions are raised about how Partials and humankind might co-exist. Accompanied by Afa Demoux, an unhinged former ParaGen employee, and Samm and Heron, two Partials with divided loyalties, Kira ventures into the poisoned heart of the continent, hoping to find a solution before both humans and Partials succumb to extinction.
","Fragments is a worthy successor to Partials, the initial volume of this dystopian science fiction adventure. It suffers from some of the standard pitfalls of middle books in a series, sometimes feeling a little static and overly complicated. But author Dan Wells spins out some interesting new wrinkles to his inventive plotting, and the series is notable in the way that it grapples with the thorny issues it raises, using the dystopian setting for much more than just window dressing. Here's hoping Wells can stick the landing with the conclusion of this sequence!","Parents need to know that Fragments is a suspenseful, engaging continuation of the science-fiction adventure begun in Partials. Although set in a dystopian future, the novel takes pains to be plausible and raises interesting questions about bioethics and civil rights. The plot contains some gun battles that end in fatalities, as well as an attack by feral dogs and a harrowing episode involving acid rain showers, but the body count and amount of bloody detail are relatively low.There's little objectionable language (a few instances each of ""damn,"" ""hell,"" and ""piss""), no substance abuse, and only some minor romantic attraction and flirting.

The Wonderling,"Peril, appealing characters fill rich, imaginative fantasy.","Stuck in the Home for Wayward and Misbegotten Creatures for as long as he can remember, young fox-headed, human-bodied Number Thirteen, aka THE WONDERLING, has a grim life and little hope, just like all the human-animal hybrid children imprisoned there and enslaved when they get old enough. But when, at age 11, he overcomes his terror long enough to save small, birdlike Trinket from cruel bullies, she dubs him Arthur, after the King, and opens up a world of possibilities. She's determined to escape and find her lost relatives in the city of Lumentown; he dreams of learning where he came from, but is he brave enough to join Trinket in her crazy scheme? And then what?
","Author-artist Mira Bartok's first work for young readers builds a rich, complicated world populated with creepy villains, Dickensian street urchins, and brave orphan heroes with unexpected talents. World-building takes a bit, but by the time Arthur (soon to be known as The Wonderling) and Trinket escape the horrible orphanage and begin their wild adventures, readers will be laughing, cheering them on, thrilling at their predicaments, and hoping they manage to stay out of trouble, or at least keep from being eaten.","Parents need to know that there's a lot to love in The Wonderling, author-illustrator Mira Bartok's first book for young readers and the first installment in a new fantasy series. There's darkness and scary stuff as young hero Arthur, a ""groundling"" (human-animal hybrid) with a fox's head, one ear, and a human-type body, makes his way through a richly imagined steampunk world from creepy orphanage to creepier prison in quest of his roots. But readers unfazed by the monsters and situations of, say, Harry Potter should have no problem. Friendship literally changes the young hero's life, and there are strong messages of kindness, empathy, family, teamwork, using your talents, and helping others.

Malcolm Under the Stars,"Sweetness, positive messages galore in brave-rat sequel.","After the dramatic events of Malcolm at Midnight, things seem to be settling down for the critters, nutters (kids), and lankies (adults) of McKenna School. But brave, well-meaning young Malcolm the rat is still worried: He's not convinced the crazed, murderous Snip the cat from Book 1 is really gone. Soon a bigger peril looms: The once state-of-the-art school is falling apart, and the school board wants to close it. Meanwhile, Malcolm's human BFF Amelia has been acting very strangely. As kids and critters work together to prevent disaster, they go down unexpected paths, from historical research into the school's past to an unheard-of collaboration between Inside and Outside animals as Malcolm leaves the comfort of his cage to become MALCOLM UNDER THE STARS.
","Malcolm and his multi-species friends return in a fun sequel with all the original's appeal and a bit less scariness. Author W.H. Beck's lively, vocabulary-drenched narrative (in the voice of Mr. Binney's fifth-graders) and Brian Lies' endearing illustrations make the characters relatable and appealing as they test boundaries and try to solve numerous mysteries, from finding the legendary treasure that might save their school to figuring out why Amelia is cting so strangely all of a sudden.
The story dishes out plenty of positive messages -- especially about the power of forgiveness and love -- but avoids getting preachy.","Parents need to know that Malcolm Under the Stars, the follow-up to Malcolm at Midnight, has all the appeal of the first book nd a bit less scariness. In less skilled hands than those of author W.H.

Tyler Makes Pancakes!,Lively cooking story whipped together with fun food info.,"Tyler dreams of pancakes, and when he wakes up, he decides to surprise his mom and dad by going off on his bike with his trusty dog, Tofu, to get the ingredients at Mr. Jones' market. Mr Jones then explains where all the ingredients come from -- eggs from chickens on a farm, buttermilk and butter from cows, blueberries from bushes, flour from wheat that grows \""in flat places like Kanasas,\"" and maple syup that comes from trees \""way up in Vermont.\"" Mr. Jones also explains how these things are collected or harvested at the source and brought to the grocery store. Back home, Tyler follows the recipe step by step and serves his parents a breakfast feast. The actual recipe and some fun food facts follow on the last pages.

"Click, Clack, Boo!: A Tricky Treat",Animals lure Farmer Brown to holiday fun in spooky sequel.,"Farmer Brown hates Halloween because it scares him: \""Witches give him nightmares. Pirates give him shivers. Jack-o'-lanterns flicker spooky shadows on the wall.\"" So while the barnyard animals are busy preparing for their Halloween costume party, he puts out a bowl of candy for the trick-or-treaters and goes to bed to hide under the covers. But then he starts to hear some creaky, creepy, spooky sounds and finally a \""tap, tap, tapping\"" at his door. He gets up and finds an invitation to the party nailed to his door and finally sneaks over to the barn to see what's up.
","CLICK, CLACK, BOO! is a gentle, Halloween-themed story with some of the same appealing characters from Click, Clack, Moo. But here the animals are not in revolt against Farmer Brown. They just want to have a party and include him in the fun!
The simple story is enhanced by the repetition of creepy sounds that seem at first to be scary but ultimately prove to be harmless, such as the ""tap, tap, tapping"" on a door and window, the ""creak, creak, creaking"" on the old boards of the front porch, and the ""crunch, crunch, crunching"" of footsteps on autumn leaves.

Jasper and the Riddle of Riley's Mine,Rip-roaring historical adventure of brothers in a gold rush.,"JASPER AND THE RIDDLE OF RILEY'S MINE finds its 11-year-old narrator and his 16-year-old brother fleeing an abusive home situation and heading for Alaska in 1897. Like everyone else on the quest, they've got gold fever, dreaming of incredible riches or at least enough money to buy food on a regular basis. And like just about everyone else, they hope to discover the legendary Riley's Mine, which supposedly made Riley so rich he abandoned it for the first person to decipher his odd clues. Things get off to a bad start when one lens of Jasper's glasses gets broken, leaving him with only one good eye, and soon get more perilous as bad weather and worse characters come on the scene. But quick thinking, brotherly bonds, an enterprising spirit, and Mama's washboard all serve the boys well.
","Caroline Starr Rose's fast-paced historical adventure finds two brothers seeking their fortune in the Klondike, with tall tales, deadly weather, gun-toting villains, and the kindness of strangers. There's lots of period detail and colorful characters, and a strong moral compass that keeps the boys from going astray. Eleven-year-old Jasper's narrative voice is heavy on what now would be considered poor grammar (especially ""ain't""), but there's nothing wrong with his powers of description, as here, where he and Melvin encounter the first nuns Jasper's ever seen:
""Mel taps my head, a reminder I'm to take my cap off, too. He acts like this is the most regular thing he's ever seen, three ladies dressed up like bats, tugging at a boat frozen in the Yukon River.""","Parents need to know that Jasper and the Riddle of Riley's Mine, Caroline Starr Rose's (May B.) first story featuring boys as central characters, is an old-fashioned, rip-roaring adventure set in the Klondike Gold Rush in the last years of the 19th century. As 11-year-old narrator Jasper and his 16-year-old brother, Melvin, flee their abusive father in Washington and join hordes of gold-seekers flocking north, they find many dangers, along with tall tales, colorful characters, and quite a few surprises. There are some mature elements: gun-toting scoundrels kidnap (and accidentally shoot) a character, and since their mother died some years earlier, the boys' father has been a violent drunk, drinking away all the money Melvin gives him to support the family. (On a lighter note, a traveling aristocrat -- based on a real historic person -- gets his gold by selling Champagne to the miners.) Grifters, con artists, and scammers abound, as the boys learn the hard way, but so do kind people, especially when things are most hopeless. Strong character, determination, loyalty between brothers, and paying attention when Mama taught you to do laundry all play an important, positive role.

The Witch's Boy,Rumplestiltskin revealed! Why he did what he did.,"An unusually ugly baby is left for a great witch to care for. Knowing little about children, she names him Lump, and gets a bear to be his nursemaid and a captive afreet to build his nursery. With these companions he grows up ignorant of his appearance until the first time he meets other humans. Badly treated by them, Lump becomes vengeful and petulant, and his disobedient actions cause his witch-mother to lose her powers. Forced to flee with a cat-turned-human, they become itinerant entertainers, and Lump turns into a loutish young man. He becomes obsessed with Aude, a cold but beautiful social climber and, after his actions cause his mother to flee and his companions to be imprisoned, he embarks on heedless acquisition of wealth to impress Aude.
","The novelized fairy tale is a rich and growing genre, and this is a more than worthy entry. In the original Grimm story there is little reason for the appearance of the little man, his offer to help, or his demand for the woman's first baby. His help at first seems generous, and after he unreasonably demands her first born he gives her a way out. But when she succeeds in guessing his name, he tears himself in half. Very strange behavior. A member of the Actor's Studio would have reason to ask, ""What's the motivation?""
Author Michael Gruber provides a thorough backstory that explains all, as well as an after-the-fairy-tale ending that wraps things up a little too easily. Lyrically written, engrossing, at time humorous, though a bit overlong, this vivid reimagining is as prickly and unpredictable as Rumplestiltskin himself.","Parents need to know that extrapolating the lives of fairy-tale characters before and after their stories take place can make for interesting discussions -- and may inspire readers to search out other modern retellings. There is some violence here, including a beheading, various injuries, and death.  Lump is tortured and dogs are killed -- but it is within a context where witches and djinns exist. Lump is a surly, ungrateful boy, but he is ultimately redeemed.

Dark Dude,Misfit escapes inner city. Moving identity story for teens.,"Rico looks white, but he's a Cuban living in Harlem in the '60s. A bright kid who loves to read, he is often picked on, sometimes beaten, doesn't feel he belongs anywhere, has a drunken father and an angry mother, and his only friend is turning into a junkie. There's little that's good in his life. So he decides to run away, dragging the junkie friend with him, and hitchhikes to Wisconsin, where an older friend from his neighborhood is living in a ramshackle farmhouse without running water. There he finds some peace and a gas-station job, but he can't go to school, and still doesn't know where he belongs.
","Pulitzer-winning author Oscar Hijuelos's first young adult book is really for older teens and adults. Its subject matter is unusual: a white Cuban boy from Harlem washing up on a run-down farm in Wisconsin. Though it runs more than 400 pages of not a lot happening in between small incidents of nasty violence, and has more coolness and emotional distance than most YA books, the pages fly by, and it's engrossing from beginning to end. It's easy to see why Hijuelo's won that Pulitzer (for The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love) -- the man can write.
	Rico may steal comic books from the store, but he is mostly a nice kid who just wants to get along, get an education, and get out. Hijuelos adeptly sets Rico up in a no-win situation, then allows him a sort of winning, but at a cost that may be more than Rico is willing to go on paying. While few readers will relate directly to the particulars of his situation, most will relate to Rico himself, and his outsider status is universal.","Parents need to know that there is a lot of adult content here: language, sexual references, violence, and drug use (including one very detailed scene of preparation and injection of heroin). See the advisories for details. But the mature material is not glamorized, and instead shows the hardships that Rico faces as a white-looking Cuban growing up in a black and Hispanic ghetto -- and why he is desperate to run away to another life. Teens will find it easy to sympathize with Rico, who mostly tries to do the right thing -- and his story will certainly get them thinking about identity, race, poverty, addiction, and a host of other important issues.

Diary of an Awesome Friendly Kid: Rowley Jefferson's Journal,Greg is meaner to gullible BFF Rowley in Wimpy Kid spin-off.,"In DIARY OF AN AWESOME FRIENDLY KID: ROWLEY JEFFERSON'S JOURNAL, Rowley sees how much his best friend, Greg, enjoys his Wimpy Kid diary, so he decides to write his own story. His first creative mistake is to show it to Greg, who asserts that Rowley should write a biography about him instead. So Rowley reformats his journal into tales of the two of them, when they first met, their first sleepover (Rowley gets scared and goes home early), a disastrous birthday party where the best part is an angry swarm of hornets, the discovery of an ancient burial ground (or not), and so much more. Rowley figures out a few things about his friend along the way: that he may not always be telling the truth (duh), and he's the worst study partner in the world.  ","Wimpy Kid fans who have a soft spot for gullible, sweet, dorky Rowley may find some laughs in this spin-off, but they may also get angry at Greg for being such a bad friend. They could feel misled by the title that features Rowley, too. Greg takes over the story early on and dominates it throughout. The only difference with Rowley Jefferson's Journal and the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series is that readers focus almost entirely on the Greg-Rowley friendship here, if you could call it that. Rowley puts up with a whole lot, doing Greg's chores, falling for his lies because he trusts his friend when he shouldn't, and, at one point, even not being allowed to pee during  sleepover at Greg's house. In one segment where Rowley is trying hard to study for his math test, Greg's distraction tactics are relentless. At some point it's so ridiculous it's funny again, but until it gets there readers may be rooting for Rowley to ditch his BFF for someone who doesn't treat him this way. How about befriending another math wiz who likes to study, too?
If Jeff Kinney wants to write about Rowley, he should dig deeper into who he is and show some more appreciation for him in the storytelling. Otherwise, he's better off sticking with Greg as his main character.","Parents need to know that Diary of an Awesome Friendly Kid: Rowley Jefferson's Journal  is a spin-off of the blockbuster Wimpy Kid series by Jeff Kinney. Greg is the original Wimpy Kid and Rowley is his gullible best friend who puts up with a lot from Greg. Rowley is lied to and taken advantage of. Greg talks him into doing all his chores for special certificates and other prizes, and he even cheats off Rowley's math test. Many examples of middle school friend conflicts arise in Rowley Jefferson's Journal, so this may be a good one to read with kids having social conflicts. Together you can talk through what being a good friend is about. There's little violence: a fall into a pit with a hornet's nest and many stings, a hit on a head with a racket, and a sprained ankle. Kids get wound up over scary stuff in their imaginations: ghosts, graves in a burial ground, and a half-man half-goat out roaming the neighborhood.

Bloodlines,Vampire story with strong heroine explores prejudice.,"In this Vampire Academy spin-off, the focus shifts from Rose Hathaway to secondary character Sydney Sage, a clever 18-year-old Alchemist who's sent on an undercover mission to protect Jill, the Moroi vampire queen's sister. Sydney must pretend to be Jill's sister as they attend an elite boarding school in Palm Springs, Calif., along with Jill's bodyguard, Eddie, and the smug and sexy Adrian, who lives nearby with the town's one Moroi inhabitant. Complicating the assignment is Sydney's palpable dislike of Palm Springs' head Alchemist, Keith, who keeps threatening to replace Sydney with her less experienced younger sister if she keeps acting like a \""vamp lover.\"" As Sydney grows accustomed to her vampire-guarding post, she discovers her human classmates keep sporting mysterious \""magical\"" tattoos. Plus, young women -- human and vampire alike -- keep popping up dead.
","Some firsts in a series re all punchy exposition to get you hooked before the action revs up, while others are spectacular even by stand-alone standards; BLOODLINES is more the former. While there are a few suspenseful central mysteries to follow and be resolved, this is clearly an exercise in getting to know Sydney -- a brilliant introvert who has never felt appreciated or unconditionally loved by her perfectionist father -- and see her adapt to her precarious new mission. Her interactions with flirtatious vampire Adrian and intriguing human classmate Trey are particularly fascinating, because they force the self-conscious Sydney to entertain the idea that she's actually a girl, not just an Alchemist.
Fans hoping for fluttery romance will have to wait for the next installments. Mead has a knack for making it seem like every male could possibly be interested in every female and vice-versa, but there definitely were a couple of bold-faced possibilities for Sydney in the next book. Since Sydney is often portrayed as a Hermione-esque character (incredibly smart, logical and invested in helping others) with no romantic experience, it will be interesting to see how Mead weaves in a first-love plotline for the plucky and mature heroine. You don't have to be familiar with Vampire Academy to enjoy Bloodlines, but those who've read that series will have a deeper sense of the various characters' personalities.","Parents need to know that this is the first installment in the new series by best-selling Vampire Academy author Richelle Mead. The heroine in this installment does not fall head over heels in love, like most female YA protagonists, so there's very little romance, for once. There is some language -- mostly the occasional ""s--t"" or ""assh--e"" -- as well as a climactic scene involving a couple of deaths, as well as some injuries to a few main characters. A 21-year-old character drinks and smokes cigarettes, but the school-aged teens are pretty chaste and party-free.

"EngiNerds, Book 1","Rogue robots, realistic friendships in smart series launch.","Ken, part of a group of smart middle-schoolers called the ENGINERDS, is giddy when he finds a box on his doorstep full of parts for a robot. He and his friend Dan start to put it together -- but then the robot finishes assembling itself, introduces himself as Greeeg, and demands to be fed. Everything. Before long, Greeeg has consumed everything in the house and has begun firing dangerous cubes out of his bottom. Ken's enthusiasm gives way to dread as he, Dan, and fellow EngiNerds realize Greeeg is just one of many insatiably hungry robots whose single-minded mission is proving dangerous. As the robots grow more aggressive, Ken and his friends need to come up with a science-smart plan to fight back and -- hopefully -- save the world.
","Jarrett Lerner's strong entry into the growing genre of STEM adventures hits some of the hallmarks -- like robots and DIY problem-solving skills -- but adds a welcome dose of emotional authenticity. EngiNerds is narrated by Ken, who's alternately loyal, dismissive, warmhearted, cocky, humbled, and courageous. Readers may be drawn in by rogue robots and plentiful potty humor, but they'll stay for the well-developed story and perceptive portrayal of kids whose passions aren't always understood, even by their closest friends. The robots' raging appetites are good for laughs, but there's real food for thought in the backstory of how and why the robots were designed.
The book is crying out for a how-to on making a catapult from chopsticks -- but inspired readers may enjoy the challenge of figuring it out. A few plot threads hint at the direction of the next book, set up by a cliffhanger ending.","Parents need to know that EngiNerds -- the promising start of a series by Jarrett Lerner -- is a well-written story about a group of engineering-minded 12-year-old boys whose technical know-how leads them in unexpected directions. There's a strong element of potty humor, but the book touches on substantive topics including friendship, respect, personal responsibility, and global challenges. A few children suffer minor injuries from the robots, and there are a few perilous moments. The EngiNerds seem to be ethnically diverse, but there are no female characters.

Some Places More Than Others,Tween girl helps heal family rift in charming novel.,"When SOME PLACES MORE THAN OTHERS begins, 11-year-old Amara is begging her parents to let her travel to New York City with her father when he goes there for business. Amara lives in Portland, Oregon, where her father, Charles, works for Nike and her mother, Leslie, designs dresses and owns a boutique. Amara's mother is eight months pregnant with a baby girl after having had many miscarriages. Her dad's side of the family -- Amara's aunt, two cousins, and widowed grandfather -- live in Harlem. Amara is surprised when her parents relent. Before they go, her mom explains that Charles and his father, Grandpa Earl, haven't really spoken for 12 years. The rift dates to the time Amara was born, which was the same day that Grandma Grace died. Leslie encourages Amara to help her father and grandfather mend their relationship. Also, Amara has been assigned a school project to create a time capsule that captures her family history and hopes for the future. Amara has a week in Harlem to learn what she can about both her family and life in the big city.
","This book about family history and relationships charms from its opening chapter. In Some Places More Than Others, Renée Watson weaves  connection between the complicated realities that characterize New York City, the history of black people in America, and one particular loving and lovable family.
New Yorkers and people who love that city will have fun with the details: the line of taxicabs at JFK Airport, Jamaican meat patties, and taking the uptown train by mistake when you're headed downtown. A strength of this book is that it deals with painful emotions without invoking controversial or disturbing situations. ","Parents need to know that Some Places More Than Others, by Newbery Honor and Coretta Scott King Award-winning author Renée Watson (Piecing Me Together), is the story of Amara, an African American girl living in Beaverton, Oregon, who takes a trip with her father to Harlem for her 12th birthday. There she visits her dad's old haunts, the college where her parents met, and sites of New York City. She also meets her cousins and Grandpa Earl for the first time. Her father and his father have been estranged since the day Amara was born, the same day her paternal grandma Grace died. There are a few heavy-handed plugs for Nike sneakers. They set the scene, as Amara's father works at Nike, but they are frequent enough to be noticeable.

"House of Furies, Book 1",Devilish doings drive suspenseful Victorian tale of terror.,"At the start of HOUSE OF FURIES, young Louisa Ditton is happy to be employed as a maid at remote Coldthistle House. She gradually learns, however, that not all of Coldthistle's guests leave. Those who are judged guilty of unpunished capital crimes receive deadly justice at the hands of the staff and the house's master, the Devil himself. Louisa soon wants to escape, but she's held back by the fear that her friend, the handsome Lee, will be unjustly executed for a crime he did not commit.
","Deals with the devil can make for diabolical plot twists, and this novel in the Gothic tradition provides some satanic reversals. The premise of House of Furies is spelled out right in the introduction. This is a shame, because it's a secret worth holding onto for a chapter or three. Nevertheless, author Madeleine Roux does a fine job of generating creepy suspense while her feisty protagonist, Louisa, seeks a way to escape Coldthistle House and its murderous residents. There''s humor and horror, with a light dusting of romance. There's also  satisfying twist that hints at more occult shenanigans to come.","Parents need to know that House of Furies is the start of a new horror series by Madeleine Roux (Asylum). It features encounters with the supernatural and the devil. Swearing is light and limited to ""damn,"" ""hell,"" ""bastard,"" and ""bitch."" Louisa and her male friend Lee are attracted to each other, but a kiss or two is all they share. Five characters are killed by magic and other means. A male character tries to assault Louisa, but he's killed before that can happen.

The Girl from Everywhere,Romantic adventure features time-traveling pirates.,"Sixteen-year-old Nixie loves many of the aspects of life aboard her father's ship, the Temptation, especially since he can, with the right map, navigate to wide-ranging mythological lands and historical time periods. Nixie, however, worries that he's too obsessed with being reunited with his true love, Nixie's mother, who died in Hawaii in the mid-1800s. She fears that the Captain, an opium addict, is willing to gamble with the paradoxes that might cause her to wink out of existence. She wants to set out on her own before that happens, but her father embroils her in a desperate plan to steal a fortune in gold.
","Thanks to its unusual setting, Hawaii in the 1860s, and its mix of the mythical and the historic, this romantic adventure succeeds in spinning a complicated tale of time travel and family conflict. THE GIRL FROM EVERYWHERE features a compelling main character eager to set off on adventure, yet bound by the obligations she feels to her family and fellow crewmates. Nixie's relationship with the charming young thief Kashmir is particularly well-handled, as are her mixed feelings for her dangerously obsessed father. Author Heidi Heilig keeps the narrative pace brisk, the stakes high, and the repartee witty.","Parents need to know that The Girl from Everywhere is a fantasy adventure set mostly in Hawaii during the mid-1800s and features teens involved in criminal activities (pirating and other robberies). Sexual content is mostly limited to flirting and cuddling while sleeping.

Fairest: The Lunar Chronicles: Levana's Story,Absorbing prequel from the evil queen's perspective.,"Princess Levana is furious with her sister, Queen Channery, when she makes Levana give a speech at their parents' funeral while she runs off to fool around with a palace guard. At 15, Levana tries to look tearful as her sister's new Lunar subjects line up to offer their condolences. But she doesn't care all that much that her distant parents were assassinated. She cares more about a guard named Evret, whom she has a crush on, introducing her to his very pregnant wife, Solstice. Jealousy begins to get the better of her to the point of obsession when she uses her skill in glamours to make her look exactly like Solstice. When Solstice dies in childbirth, Levana thinks it's fate. She'll make Evret care for her by looking like Solstice permanently. Of course he may need extra persuading -- the kind only mind control can provide. Evret must never see her as she is, disfigured in a fire long ago, especially since she will be queen one day. No one must ever see.
","Readers love to hate Queen Levana, especially by the end of the third book in the Lunar Chronicles, Cress. We're rooting for her to get left at the altar almost as much as we're rooting for Cinder to kick her butt. FAIREST is a worthy prequel to a great series, and not only because it fills in a few holes after the first three books about what life on the moon is like, where Winter came from, and what happened to Princess Selene and her mother; it's because we get to see things from Levana's perspective, and it's positively haunting.
Fairest shows Levana slowly devolve from a lonely, neglected teen into an envious, spiteful, and murderous queen drunk on power. She's awful, but as readers see how she got to be that way there's no getting around having a glimmer of empathy for her. It's great added depth to the story and to the whole Lunar Chronicles series. ","Parents need to know that rabid readers of the bestselling Lunar Chronicles series will want to get their hands on this prequel. It's the shorter story of how the Lunar Queen Levana got to be her evil self. As the fairy-tale homage unfolds, we see Levana become more like the queen in ""Snow White"": more ambitious, envious, vain, insecure, and completely lacking in empathy. She's embroiled in assassinations by stabbing, gunshot, and fire (a near-assassination in that case) nd brainwashes a man into having sex with her (not described, but she's 16 at the time). Her sister Channery is a worse queen, ordering her favorite seamstress' feet removed so the poor woman can concentrate on her sewing, as well as sleeping with lots of men (never described) before becoming pregnant, happy that she doesn't know the father of the baby. So with the mature content, this is definitely a teen series. The great thing about this one is the opportunity to get up close and personal with the series' ntagonist. The positive message lies in readers realizing it's possible to find a little empathy for those set so firmly on the wrong path; nothing is really 100 percent good or evil or black or white.

Witness,Confusing yet compelling tale of racism.,"Life in a small Vermont town in the 1920s is disrupted when the Ku Klux Klan starts making inroads and picking up adherents there. With their usual tactics of threats, intimidation, and cross burning, they create a climate of fear and division, especially for two young girls, one black and one Jewish. But Vermonters, though certainly racist, don't respond in the same way as the Klan has been used to in the South.
","Written in free-verse poetry, divided into five acts, and told from the point of view of a large cast of characters, this is, at times, a confusing hodge-podge. It would make a better performance piece than it does a novel. Many (though not all) of the characters are listed in the front, with photos, names, ages, and occupations, and many readers will need to refer to this list frequently to keep them all straight.
Much of the style, including the rather flat-footed poetry, the lack of capital letters, and the cute but bizarre dialect invented for Esther, the little Jewish girl, seem arbitrary. Nevertheless, the story, revealed in bits and pieces through the poems, is compelling and holds the reader's interest. And somewhere, some avant-garde high school drama teacher is going to make a terrific little theater piece out of this.","Parents need to know that the subject of this book is a great topic for discussion -- racism, its permeation into everyday life, and the quiet way decent people stand up to it. This historical fiction can bring to life something that readers may have encountered in history class. It can certainly lead to some good discussions -- between teacher and class, or among family members.

She also has questions about all the advice from her family, friends, the church, and eventually her boyfriend. Growing up is hard, navigating everyone else's opinions. Who should she listen to?

","Hauntingly honest nd incredibly engaging, this novel has such rhythmic and lyrical prose that even the awful moments have significant beauty.

Tamani perfectly captures that internal struggle that comes with finding and using your own voice and trusting yourself.

","Parents need to know that Calling My Name is a lyrical, honest novel that deals with the typical teen issues of growing up, relationships, and navigating intimacy from the perspective of a devoutly religious family.

Fat Kid Rules the World,Meaty book offers plenty to talk about.,"Troy, a 300-pound high-schooler, is contemplating jumping in front of a train when he meets Curt, an emaciated, homeless, guitar-playing, drop-out legend in his school. Before he knows what has hit him, Troy has agreed to be the drummer in a new band Curt is forming, despite not playing drums. With a faith in him that Troy doesn't understand, Curt is Troy's nightmare and dream come true, often at the same time. Though Troy's father suspects that Curt's a junkie, he ultimately supports Troy's efforts to learn the drums, the first thing he has seemed interested in since his mother died. But getting involved in Curt's world of punk rock and street life is more than any of them bargained for.
","Though told by Troy, this is really the story of Curt, surely the most charming homeless teen junkie guitar-god in literature. Devious, brilliantly talented, weirdly wise, slightly insane, leading a nightmare life, a tornado of energy and need, Curt is an original, and horrifyingly delightful, character. Though depressed and at times self-pitying, Troy has a sense of humor. He sees everything in his life through the lens of his weight, but doesn't even consider doing anything about it: He was skinny before his mother died, now he's fat, and that's it. Despite the seemingly loud and crazed storyline, first-time novelist K. Going is ingeniously subtle. Troy's father is a rigid stereotype in Troy's eyes, and for a while the reader's eyes, too. But from Curt's point of view, and in the midst of crisis, his faults morph into virtues without too much gong-beating from the author. Young readers may have cause to reassess their opinions of their own parents.","Parents need to know that this book looks at an unexpected friendship between two troubled boys.

"Brisingr: The Inheritance Cycle, Book 3",Overlong but exciting; gorier than the first two.,"Eragon and Saphira struggle to fulfill the promises they have made: to help Roran rescue Katrina from the Ra'zac, to keep the Varden united and obey Nasuada, to complete their training with the elves, to repair the Dwarves' star sapphire, to undo their spell on Elva, to support Orik, and to avenge Hrothgar, Garrow, and Kvistor.
","Young author Christopher Paolini continues to grow as a writer, and his story has an ability to capture and hold his readers' attentions even over the far-too-long expanse of his longest novel yet. His characters, settings, and action set-pieces are vivid and continue to thrill, and there is no doubt that this third book in what is now planned to be a four-book series will sell well and please many of his fans.
But his decision, presumably approved by his editors, to extend the trilogy to four books has given his propensity for self-indulgence free rein. The actual plot here warrants perhaps 250-300 pages. The rest is spent in what can only be described as showing off. He loves flaunting his vocabulary in lengthy, unnecessary descriptions: in one scene, for instance, where a bunch of men are ringing bells, he divides them in two just so that he can describe half of them ""producing a dolorous cacophony of notes"" while the other half ""cause iron tongues to crash against iron throats and emit a mournful clamor."" He continues to include sophomoric bull-sessions that run to dozens of pages, and he seems incapable of doing a bit of research without foisting it all on the reader: for example, his description of the forging of a sword takes up an entire 16-page chapter. Paolini is a very good writer, and has the talent to be a great one -- all he needs is the discipline.","Parents need to know that the gore factor is very high and frequent here, even higher than the previous books in the series. Expect piles of bodies and graphic descriptions of things like beheadings and disembowelment amidst the many battles. There is also some mild sexual innuendo.

Making Our Way Home: The Great Migration and the Black American Dream,Compelling history of an epic journey that changed America.,"MAKING OUR WAY HOME: THE GREAT MIGRATION AND THE BLACK AMERICAN DREAM is divided into seven chapters, each covering a span of years. ""Separate But Equal (post-Civil War Reconstruction-1919)"" begins with hope, as Black men are elected or appointed to local, state, and federal offices. But this hope is shattered by violence and the implementation of ""separate but equal"" policies. The first wave of migrants moving North in search of jobs begins in 1916, but they're met with racism, discrimination, and too often violence. ""Beautiful -- And Ugly, Too"" (1920-1929) details the Harlem Renaissance of Black writers, poets, and musicians that would help define a new chapter in Black identity and the massacre of Black citizens in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In ""I, Too, Am America"" (1930-1939), the Great Depression brings the first wave of immigration to a close and the New Deal, which promised help to Americans in need, offers little to Black Americans. ""Liberty and Justice for All"" (1940-1949) sees the second wave of immigration begin, as almost 5 million people leave the South and move to cities across America. The million Black men and women who served in the armed forces during World War II return from the war to find to racism, housing discrimination, and limited or no access to the GI Bill. ""Trouble Ahead"" (1950-1959) chronicles the beginning of the civil rights movement, the Supreme Court decision that found school segregation illegal, and Rosa Parks refusing to give up her seat on the bu. ""The Time Is in the Street, You Know"" (1960-1969) explores a decade of violence and social change that included Black Power, Black Is Beautiful, the Black Panthers, Motown, Freedom Riders, voter registration, Vietnam, and the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. In the final chapter ""All Power to All People"" (1970-1979), the period of Black migration comes to an end, hip hop is born, Black enrollment in college soars, and Roots becomes one of the most watched shows in television history.
","This captivating story of perseverance and courage brings to life an epic journey that transformed forever the culture, politics, and demographics of America. The massive amount of information in Making Our Way Home might intimidate all but the most avid history student, but the captivating illustrations give an almost graphic novel feel to the book, something that should intrigue even readers reluctant to tackle six decades of history.","Parents need to know that Blair Imani's Making Our Way Home: The Great Migration and the Black American Dream chronicles the journey of millions of Black Americans who fled the violence and racism of the South in search of better lives and the impact that migration would have on the politics, economy, and culture of America. Beginning in the years just after the Civil War and ending in the 1970s, Imani uses the stories of Black activists, politicians, entrepreneurs, writers, and musicians to explore issues still relevant today -- voting rights, housing discrimination, segregated schools, LGBTQ rights, and domestic terrorism. Although rarely described in graphic detail, violence (lynchings, mob violence, bombings, beatings, and murder) is a constant throughout the story.

The Catcher in the Rye,One of the greatest novels of the 20th century.,"Holden Caulfield, about to be kicked out of yet another boarding school for flunking most of his courses, decides not to wait until the end of term and takes off for his hometown, Manhattan, a few days early. He figures he'll hole up in a cheap hotel, look up a few friends, then arrive home on time. But Holden is deeply troubled by the death of his beloved younger brother from leukemia, as well as a classmate's suicide. Alone in an uncaring city, his already fragile psyche begins to unravel.
","Holden Caulfield holds a place in the American psyche akin to Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer: an exquisitely rendered character with whom nearly anyone can identify. There are three true things that can be said about J.D. Salinger's masterpiece: It is one of the great works of American literature, it is one of the most frequently challenged by would-be book-banners, and, therefore, it is one of the most misunderstood books of the 20th century. It has been challenged and banned for all of the reasons mentioned above in the content advisories. But those who challenge it fail to see the forest for the little swearword trees. They have called Holden a cynical teenager, when in fact he's such a compassionate innocent abroad that he can hardly cope with the cynical world at all: He's so innocent and so alone that he tries to get a prostitute to just chat and keep him company (alas, no heart of gold here). Desperately lonely, adrift in what seems to him an uncaring world, he has been through some terrible experiences, and no one at all seems to have noticed that he's crumbling.
It's true that much of it is somewhat dated now. Yet there's a reason this book has stayed in print, is stocked in nearly every bookstore, and has been assigned in nearly every high school for the past 60-plus years: Its emotional power and poignancy are still as strong as ever, and Holden's inner self is just as recognizable to teens today as it has ever been. This is one of those books that everyone should read as a teen. At a time (1951) when ""teen"" and ""adolescent"" were barely concepts in the American mind, Salinger captured the adolescent voice and way of thinking more perfectly -- and more poignantly -- than just about anyone before or since.","Parents need to know that this book remains one of the best books about adolescence ever written. Any language used -- and it is chock full of mild to moderate swearing, and ""f--k"" is used several times -- is in the service of being true to the nature of a rebellious teen. There are also lots of sexual references, and everyone smokes and drinks -- including the underage protagonist. Holden refers to homosexuals as ""flits."" People have used these instances in an effort to have the book banned. But those who would do so miss the point of the book, which is a compassionate tale of a child adrift in the world. It's an American classic that everyone should read.

"Forgive Me, Leonard Peacock","Misfit plans murder and suicide in painful, powerful book.","On Leonard Peacock's 18th birthday, the brilliant but broken teen plans to murder his former best friend and then kill himself. He spends the day giving out gifts to the few people he cares about -- including his elderly, Humphrey Bogart-obsessed next door neighbor; a beautiful Christian girl who has tried to convert him; and his wonderful Holocaust teacher -- slowly revealing to readers the traumas that have brought him to this tragic moment and why he is \""hoping that I merely cease to exist.\"" Even so, readers will understand that, even on his darkest day, Leonard is looking for an excuse to continue living: Within his narration, he includes pretend letters that he's written from loved ones in the future, telling him to hold on (even these letters paint a tragic post-nuclear future, but there, Leonard has a family and a job that lets him swim with mutant dolphins and \""live in the moment\"" with those who understand him).
","FORGIVE ME, LEONARD PEACOCK is a carefully constructed coming-of-age story in the same vein as The Catcher in the Rye. Like Catcher's Holden, Leonard is in pain and frustrated by a hypocritical society but doesn't know how to connect with people, and he often puts off even the people he cares about. There are strikingly realistic and painful scenes throughout, such as Leonard's failed attempt to get his mostly absent mother to make him chocolate-chip banana pancakes. Readers will be especially moved and mesmerized by his beautiful but rather melancholy hopes for his own future.
The material is mature, but Leonard's story could lead to many provocative conversations about a wide range of topics including teen bullying, sexual abuse, violence, and suicide -- and how to help those outside the mainstream feel connected and appreciated.","Parents need to know that Forgive Me, Leonard Peacock is a book about the title character planning to murder his former best friend and then kill himself with a Nazi gun he inherited from his grandfather. This gritty, poignant coming-of-age story has lots of mature content, including the revelation that a boy was raped for years by a friend (who himself was sexually assaulted by an adult). Boys in PE class bully  Persian kid with hockey sticks until he's nearly unconscious. A boy pressures a girl sexually, continuing to kiss her even after she tells him to stop, and he later sees his friend masturbate in his room. Leonard's elderly neighbor smokes heavily and uses racist epithets, including the ""N"" word, and strong language is used heavily throughout  (including ""s--t,"" ""f--k,"" and ""a--hole""). There's a lot here that teens will find painful and distressing, but there's hope, too: Leonard's teacher tells him, ""I know how hard being different can be. But I also know how powerful a weapon being different can be. How the world needs such weapons. Gandhi was different. All great people are.""

Thanks to Violet, Cole tracks down the last princess, Elegance, his brother and friends also trapped there from Earth, and Grand Shapers, some of the most magical people in the Outskirts. No one thinks it's really possible to stop a torivor, but with Cole's unique power to lend those around him power, a small chance remains to save the five kingdoms.
","Great elements of fantasy quest tales coalesce in this series finale -- a nearly unbeatable foe, no conceivable way home again, cool magic -- but the story's momentum is too often interrupted. Time Jumpers starts out promisingly. The main character wakes up tied up in the back of a truck with two princesses and is interrogated by the king's turncoat advisor. In just a few pages, there's a rescue, a prison cell, an audience with the king and queen, and the introduction of the fastest way to get around: via Wayfinder. Cole is given his own assistant, Violet, who can open portals all over the kingdom, one after another, with a boost from Cole's power. But, oddly, when we start jumping around to gather allies, the story really stalls. Author Brandon Mull has a habit of making the reader sit through multiple retellings of what's happening in the story every time Cole gathers up another helper on his quest. That would be a great time-jumping opportunity right there to keep us moving. We also don't need to know the whole history of Wayminders and other magical disciplines as part of the main event, though it'd be great in a glossary.
Still, fans of Mull, and there are many, are used to his propensity to overexplain his worlds. And pushing through to the finale is as rewarding as always. Big-hearted Cole really brings the story home with his selfless heroism.","Parents need to know that Time Jumpers is the fifth and final book in the Five Kingdoms series from fantasy author Brandon Mull, who developed a big fan base from his Fablehaven nd Beyonders series. If kids have already read some of Mull's books, they'll find this series less violent and a little less complex than Beyonders. Yet while it's less violent, the main character, Cole, still assumes he and his friends are heading to their death when they decide to take on a god-like magical being called a torivor. There are fights with swords (one magic sword flies into a chest, killing a man instantly), arrows (a leg injury), and tables thrown at attacking soldiers. Magical powers are used to scramble minds, and a giant disappearing/reappearing snake bites its victims and makes them disappear -- a few characters are assumed dead and mourned. Animated statues attack, and characters are kidnapped. Cole continues to be thoughtful and selfless in this series. He gives a moving speech to his friends about bravery and about how we live and die matter.

Dragon Gets By,"Silly, loveable dragon story for new readers.","Five different stories in this book describe parts of a day in the blue dragon's life. From the time he wakes up, things don't go too well. He reads an egg and fries the newspaper, tries to sweep the dirt from his dirt floor, digs a hole to hold the dirt he has piled up, has a disastrous shopping trip, and after all that, waters his bed and goes to sleep in his plants. The dragon gets by ... but just barely.
","Beginning readers will get a kick out of all the silly things that happen to the little blue dragon. The pages are full of that goofy, kid-style humor. Older readers may laugh the first time through, but this will not be one of their favorites to read aloud over and over at bedtime.
Part of a large collection of Dragon Tales, this story of the loveable little blue dragon's bad day is slightly reminiscent of the Frog and Toad books, though the adventures are not as developed. Cute, bright cartoonish illustrations done in watercolor with pencil fill the pages, and the accompanying text is easy to read. While kids may not understand all of the humor at first, especially the part about the food groups, they will get caught up in the silliness very quickly.","Parents need to know that nothing harmful or inappropriate is presented in this beginning reader.

The Boy at the Back of the Class,"Poignant, adventurous refugee story highlights kid activism.","In THE BOY AT THE BACK OF THE CLASS, Onjali Q. Rauf's debut novel, a boy named Ahmet suddenly appears sitting in the back Mrs. Khan's class. He doesn't speak to anyone, seems very scared, and disappears at recess. The narrator, a 9-and-3/4-year-old British kid, along with a pack of friends, decides to befriend him: first with candy and oranges after school, then with soccer matches and displays of loyalty on the playground. When the kids learn that Ahmet has been separated from his family, his new friends decide to take matters in their own hands and make a plan that ends up shaking up much more than the status quo on the playground.  ","A lively plot enriches a story of a refugee kid who's come to England without his parents. The kids in The Boy in the Back of the Class take their friend's plight very seriously when they concoct a plan to help re-connect him with his lost parents. The resulting madcap scenario is steeped in serious business, and it's an overall enjoyable, informative read. The brash opinions of the adult world are almost always filtered though the insightful explanations of caring adults. In fact, the network of adults that cares about these kids is ever-present, which makes the adventurous risk-taking in the book feel cushioned.
However, there's a disconnect between the political realities surrounding these 9- and 10-year-olds and what they actually understand about the world. The narrator -- whose gender and name are not revealed until the end of the book, making the case for the universal every-kid -- has been incredibly sheltered in unusual ways. For example, the narrator doesn't know that their family has a refugee story a generation back. Nor has the narrator heard of World War II, which seems pretty unrealistic for a kid living in modern-day London. Perhaps if the characters in the book has been portrayed as younger, the naiivite would make more sense. Nevertheless, this engaging book can serve as a resource for readers who want to learn more about the global refugee crisis without being flattened by the weight of the world.","Parents need to know thatThe Boy at the Back of the Class, by human rights activist Onjali Q. Raúf, takes place in England and looks at the refugee crisis from a kid's-eye view. Some adults tell their kids that refugees are bad for the country and should be kept out (while others advocate for their relief). A teacher turns a blind eye to a bully's bad behavior because they are both white. Playground violence includes punching and fighting in a group. In a key scene, soldiers carry guns and armed guards surround children. A refugee boy describes his home having been bombed, going into exile, his sister and cat dying, and losing his parents. His accounts are told are told in broken English with the help of hand-drawn pictures, so they're not bloody or terribly detailed. But the kids who are listening are affected by the telling.

"Beasts Made of Night, Book 1","Riveting, intricately detailed, Africa-influenced fantasy.","At the beginning of BEASTS MADE OF NIGHT, Taj the Lightbringer is fed up with having to eat the sins of the upper class by battling the shadowy creatures that come out of them. But the walled city of Kos offers few methods of finding safety for his family, so when Taj is offered a post exclusively servicing the royal family, he takes it. Soon, however, he finds himself enmeshed in a dangerous court conspiracy, one that threatens all of Kos. He must prepare to battle the worst sins humankind can muster.
","Creating a fantasy that avoids the usual European-based fixtures can be hard work, but when the efforts pay off, they can be extremely satisfying, as they are in this Africa-inspired adventure. With Beasts Made of Night, debut novelist Tochi Onyebuchi creates a vibrant, intricately detailed fantasy world filled with wonder and treachery. The pace is a little slow at first, as Onyebuchi lays the groundwork necessary for the reversals that occur in the book's second half. Fans of Nnedi Okorafor are likely to be tuned to the novel's wavelength, but Beasts Made of Night is likely to appeal to a wide range of readers, who will be riveted by the shocking cliffhanger ending.

Raffie on the Run,Subway rat aims to rescue brother in swift urban adventure.,"In RAFFIE ON THE RUN, Raffie's a young rat who lives with his family in the walls of a Brooklyn subway station. His little brother Oggie, who looks up to him and believes his tall tales, foolishly ventures out to the subway platform during rush hour. When a schoolboy captures Oggie to bring to class, Raffie leaps to action to rescue his brother. He figures out that the boy's school is on Central Park West, and though he has no idea how to get there, he's helped on his journey by a pigeon with one wing, a show dog in love with a gruff watchdog, a well-spoken cockroach, and others.
","Just as the viral internet sensation Pizza Rat grabbed the pizza and ran with it, this animal fantasy opens with a New York City subway rat and a slice, and races off on a tasty adventure. In Raffie on the Run, the city itself is vividly a character, though the main characters are animals, including a rat, pigeon, cockroach, show dog, and falcon, with humans making only minor appearances. There's humor when Raffie misinterprets or has a rat perspective on human events. For instance, he calls the food-stuffed garbage can on the subway platform a ""treasure chest,"" and the custodian who empties it, ""the thief."" Author Jacqueline Resnick ensures that the story is relatable to contemporary readers by referencing social media and having nimals talk bout selfies, emojis, hashtags, nd viral videos.
Though the author used to live in Brooklyn, some of the references to New York seem stereotypical. The huckster squirrel's a character who'd more likely be encountered by tourists than natives. And New Yorkers will know that a tall luxury building wouldn't have an outside fire escape climbing to the 32nd floor. But these small details will fly over the heads of young readers, who'll get caught up in the quest and active adventure. The book's also sprinkled throughout with lovely, lively black-and-white illustrations by Joe Sutphin, adding extra dimension, fun, and animation to the already lively story.","Parents need to know that Raffie on the Run, by Jacqueline Resnick with illustrations by Joe Sutphin, is a fantasy-adventure novel set in New York City with animal characters who talk and have feelings and experiences kids can relate to. Most of the main characters are default male -- Raffie, his brother Oggie, pigeon Kaz, and the majority of the supporting characters. In some scenes, animals attack other animals, and Kaz, who has only half a wing, is sometimes taunted as ""Stumpy."" Still, the messages of inclusion are strong and clear: home and family are important, you shouldn't let your differences stop you, and though you may at first think someone's different from you, you could very well end up being friends.

Then Stephen Rose comes to town. Stephen has come to live with his crazy aunt after his father died and his mother went insane and had to be locked up. The priest asks Davie to befriend him. Stephen has a real talent with sculpting clay. But more than that, he has a talent that he believes Davie shares -- to bring his creations to life.

Here Almond displays poetic lyricism, bizarre imagination, and complex emotional undercurrents, then binds it together with suspense and enough intriguing ideas to give thoughtful kids plenty to chew on.
There are layers upon layers, and good and evil intertwine. CLAY has lots British slang that may frustrate some young readers, but those who persevere will find this an edgy and exciting look at some pretty big ideas, including the nature of good, evil, creativity, and God, and the complex relationships among them, all wrapped up in early adolescent angst and uncertainty and bravado.","Parents need to know that this is a book that will encourage kids to think about some big issues. Davie's story has him wrestling with the nature of good, evil, creativity, and God, and the complex relationships among them. Readers will enjoy pondering the questions with Davie, and debating them. Take, for example, the question raised by the main character himself: Can a person who does many bad things really be good? The kids in this book sometimes behave badly -- they drink, smoke, fight, lie, steal, and in general behave like minor-league hooligans -- but what will really stick with readers is the imaginative story, and the issues it raises. Parents may want to spark -- or at least join in on -- the discussion.

Just Listen,Teen girl struggles following trauma in riveting novel.,"Annabel's life looks pretty good. She has a loving family, lives in a beautiful home, and is a successful teen model. But her junior year of high school is looking to be the worst year of her life. Her mother has been fragile and depressed since the death of her own mother. Her sisters are fighting all the time, and one of them is hostile and dangerously anorexic. Annabel wants to quit modeling but is afraid to tell her mother. And she has lost all of her friends because of something that happened at the beginning of the summer that she is unable to talk about, and that her classmates and former friends have drastically misunderstood. The only person who will talk to her is Owen, a loner with a juvenile record, anger management issues, and strange taste in music. But there's one thing he knows all about: how to be honest.
","This angst-filled, moving novel is so engrossing it's truly difficult to put down. Thanks to author Sara Dessen's exquisite attention to detail, each moment in Just Listen is rendered so clearly and vividly that readers can easily enter Annabel's world: her misery at school and home, her inability to deal forthrightly with any of her problems, and her developing relationship with troubled outcast Owen. The characters are equally vivid, especially menacing Owen, with his bizarre musical tastes, theories, and unusual life outside school. He's a real original. And all of the main and secondary characters have n intriguing emotional complexity usually missing in teen problem novels.
Though Dessen doesn't reveal the pivotal event until near the end, most readers will have figured it out almost from the beginning. Still, it's a testament to her skill that despite the fact that for large stretches not much happens, this is a real page-turner.","Parents need to know that Sarah Dessen's Just Listen involves a teen girl, Annabel, struggling to recover from a traumatic experience she had at the beginning of the summer and dreading her approaching junior year of high school.

","En route to a huge cliffhanger, Shannon Messenger delivers plenty of social anxieties, thrilling adventures, magical creatures, and fashion makeovers s Sophie Foster's elvin epic continues. As we've come to expect from the Keeper of the Lost Cities series, the plot jumps quickly from one deadly peril to the next, and the underlying issues -- from middle school-type troubles nd dysfunctional families to the building of strong communities -- resonate with what's going on in the readers' own worlds.

You Know Me Well,Sweet story of gay teens who become fast friends.,"Told in two points of view, YOU KNOW ME WELL is the story of Bay Area teens Mark and Kate, who've sat next to each other in calculus for an entire year but don't know each other until one fateful night when they both happen to be partying in San Francisco the week leading up to the annual Pride parade. Mark and Kate are both gay and in romantic dilemmas. He's out but in love with his best friend/secret friend-with-benefits Ryan, who seems to crave a hookup with someone else even though Mark is quite obviously in love with him. Meanwhile, Kate ditches a long-awaited meet-up with the object of her affection, Violet, the worldly and beautiful bisexual cousin of Kate's best friend. Kate spots Mark at a gay bar where he's competing in an underwear modeling dance-off, and the two connect nearly instantaneously. After an evening of adventure and heartbreak, Kate and Mark help each other navigate the last week of school, romantic possibilities and realizations, and even major decisions about the future.
","LaCour and Levithan's compelling if occasionally implausible story focuses on the beautiful relationship between two gay teens who are in the right place on a night they each need a friend. Both authors are gay, and it's the first time Levithan has partnered with a writer for a book where both protagonists are gay. Kate and Mark's instant connection might seem unlikely to some readers, but it makes perfect sense given their individual journeys that they would discover a kindred spirit in the other. Both are desperate for love but unsure if they've found a true version of it: Mark can't see beyond his complicated secretly physical relationship with BFF Ryan, and Kate worries the ""real"" Violet won't live up to her idealized vision of her.
Since visual artist Kate and baseball player Mark's adventures are set against the backdrop of San Francisco Pride, the book is particularly appropriate for readers looking for strong LGBTQ themes and characters. But the story is universal, too -- the main characters might already know they're gay, but there's still plenty up in the air. They're still dealing with romantic insecurities, confusion over their futures, and issues with their other friends (most of whom are also gay, since particularly in Kate's case, coming out in eighth grade meant becoming a beacon to the other queer kids). Two secondary characters seem a bit too perfect (Violet is nearly unbelievably sophisticated, and Ryan's new suitor is ridiculously perfect, with his trifecta of looks, smarts, and humanitarianism), but otherwise this is a touching and relevant tale about friendship and love.","Parents need to know that You Know Me Well is a dual-point-of-view realistic novel written by acclaimed LGBTQ authors Nina LaCour and David Levithan about a gay junior and a lesbian senior who become fast friends the last week of school. Although the emphasis is on the protagonists' platonic friendship, they each have romantic relationships causing them trouble. There's a smattering of strong language (including ""f--k"" and ""s--t"") nd several references to passionate kisses, friends who fool around and have had sex but remain ""just friends,"" hooking up with new people, and loss of virginity, but none of it is graphic or crude. The books contains positive messages about LGBTQ youth and how support and friendship are necessary for teens to feel safe coming out.

The teens quickly claw their way to the top of the social rankings: Bella as the Queen Bee/It Girl; Victoria as the scholar; Christian as the athlete; and Valentin as the poet. Their ambitions and cruelty are matched by the very rich students around them, who are getting wind of their secret. After a few months some of the ""Faust"" children recognize their mistake and try to make a run for it, but how do hide from the devil?
","The brother-and-sister team who authored the book are in their twenties and are using social networking tools such as Twitter and Facebook to market it; unfortunately, the writing is not very good. The characters are not very likable or well developed. The bargains the ""Faust"" children made and the gifts they received in return are revealed too slowly.
Although the Faust teens begin to pay dearly for their deals (as if giving up their soul wasn't enough), we don't get to know them well enough to care. They are beautiful, humorless, and soulless, so their ruthlessness is not very surprising, or as sad as it should be. For example, Bella has chosen to give up everything in return for physical beauty, but has to pay with breath so bad that no one will come near her. She is rotting from the inside out, a pretty shell only (the story hits the reader over the head in case they miss the point). This story really should be a satire about the superficial values of our society that drives teens to obsess over perfection, but there's no humor in it. You can't have effective satire without humor.","Parents need to know that the authors have used social media (twitter DinaNV or DanielNayeri), created play lists for their characters, and created an ANOTHER FAUST Facebook page, so there may a lot of buzz about this book among teen readers. The setting among the very rich, private school world so popular in the Gossip Girl series may attract fans, but as is fitting a modern telling of Faust and the devil, this story is dark, and the characters are not sympathetic at all. The idea that four children could have so much hate and envy that they would sell their souls at the age of 10 distorts the original story and dilutes its power, so any educational value of  ""introducing"" teen readers to a classic is pretty much lost. The kids are mean, and sad;  the parents are mean, and of course, the devil is completely heartless.

"Exile: Keeper of the Lost Cities, Book 2",Exciting sequel keeps momentum of telepathic elf-girl tale.,"Twelve-year-old Sophie Foster, transported to the elf world in Keeper of the Lost Cities, in which she narrowly escaped death and learned startling secrets about herself, is just hoping for some peace, quiet, and time to hang out with her new friends. But fate -- or maybe the mysterious Black Swan organization, which created Sophie and her unusual powers by engineering her DNA -- has other plans. First there's the discovery of an alicorn, a magical winged horse with a horn on her forehead, who soon is chatting telepathically with Sophie. Struggling to understand the elf world's ways, she worries about her adoptive parents, who still mourn the death of their beloved daughter; then there's the really awful costume she has to wear for the opening ceremonies at school. When a telepathic mission gone wrong shatters the mind of her beloved mentor, Sophie and her friends are determined to bring him back, whatever the cost.
","Exciting, fast-paced, and written at a level that's accessible to newer or reluctant readers, KEEPER OF THE LOST CITIES: EXILE keeps up the momentum and the spirit of the series' opening volume. Sophie and her friends experience laughs, tears, misunderstandings, suspense, and moral dilemmas as they face many terrors -- and leave more than enough unresolved issues for the next volume, due out fall 2014.","Parents need to know that Exile: Keeper of the Lost Cities, Book 2 continues Shannon Messenger's exciting series about 12-year-old telepathic elf Sophie Foster. Its strong, appealing girl protagonist faces middle-school social perils, family struggles, and life-threatening dangers in the elf world. As in the first book, Keeper of the Lost Cities, values are positive and upbeat, but characters deal with complex ethical decisions and personal loss. The writing is easily accessible to younger and/or reluctant readers, sweeping them along as the tale unfolds. There are some scary but age-appropriate scenes, including attempted kidnappings, terrifying prisons, and mental torture/collapse as invasive telepathic probes shatter the minds of some characters. One of the magical beings produces glittering, foul-smelling poop, which becomes a recurring joke; there's also brief humor about butts, farts, wedgies, and the like.

This tour of half-covered monuments, done in intricate black-and-white line drawings, fascinates, but kids need help with the references.
 ","The surprise ending to this unusual book will have readers scrambling back through the pages to find the clues they missed the first time through. For many children, enjoying this book -- beyond looking at the intricately hatched black-and-white line drawings -- will require the help of an adult who can answer questions and provide context.

Jane Eyre,Strength of character triumphs in Bronte's masterpiece.,"When the novel begins, Jane Eyre is a 9-year-old orphan who is dependent on a heartless, widowed aunt, Mrs. Reed. Resentful of her late husband's affection for Jane, Mrs. Reed neglects her niece, then sends her to a \""charity school,\"" Lowood, where students are raised on strict rules and a poor diet, ostensibly in preparation for a harsh life. In spite of these obstacles, Jane succeeds as a student and then as a teacher, and after nine years, leaves Lowood to serve as governess to Adele, the young ward of Edward Rochester, master of mysterious Thornfield Hall. At 18, Jane gets engaged to the stern and aloof Rochester, and on their wedding day, Jane learns his secret, which leads to her becoming an independent woman.
","Charlotte Bronte's classic romantic novel is simply one of the greatest works of English fiction. Jane's independence, fortitude, and intelligence render her one of literature's strongest female characters, and the passionate love between Jane and Rochester is a romance for the ages. Bronte's development of that relationship, set against the mysteries within Thornfield Hall, is peerless.","Parents need to know that Charlotte Bronte's classic romantic novel does not contain ""mature themes"" in the modern sense, but it does require a mature reader to comprehend the characters' complex relationships and inner turmoil, and to take in the troubling events that occur: Children are abused and neglected; half of the students of Lowood School die of typhus, while the other half are malnourished and cold. Mental illness and adulterous affairs figure in the story, as well.

"The Kiss of Deception: The Remnant Chronicles, Book 1",At times confusing fantasy-romance has fab princess heroine.,"In the kingdom of Morrighan it's Princess Lia's wedding day, but not if she can help it. She and her attendant Pauline make a quick escape just before she marries a prince she's never met, and they head south, using tracking skills Lia learned from her brother to lose all the soldiers sent after her. But it's not only the king's soldiers who are looking. Her betrothed from the Kingdom of Dalbreck and an assassin from the kingdom of Venda are way more determined to find her. When they do, it's in the fishing town of Terravin. She's working at an inn and tavern, trying to make a new life for herself. Both the prince and the assassin decide to stay in the inn incognito and keep a close eye on her, and inevitably both become smitten. But it's not long before both the prince and the assassin will be called to duty for their kingdoms, especially as Vendan troops start stirring up trouble on the nearby borders. 
","Once an uthor in this genre sets up the against-all-odds romance, the pages fly until it's resolved; that part of THE KISS OF DECEPTION is refreshingly straightforward and enjoyable. But in the first half the author plays with her readers, trying to get them to figure out who's who: Is Kaden the prince or the assassin? What about Rafe? Guessing wrong, or not even knowing you've been lead astray, can be a bit unsettling and confusing -- but not as confusing as the religious text sprinkled throughout. It seems to point to knowledge that Princess Lia has of her destiny -- kind of -- but many pages will go by before the idea comes up again. Readers really needed a prologue to get grounded. All confusion will be forgiven, however, at the cliff-hanger ending; it promises a very exciting start to the sequel.","Parents need to know that The Kiss of Deception is the first book in the Remnant Chronicles romantic fantasy series by the author of The Adoration of Jenna Fox. A princess runs away from her wedding and goes into hiding, but of course she's followed, and plenty of danger ensues. There's an assassination ttempt, a kidnapping, a sexual assault (a forced kiss and some groping) and some sad deaths. Lia witnesses one and digs the graves of many killed by arrows and swords. Also expect some drinking by 17-year-olds and older men drinking to excess. The sexual content is pretty mild for a mature teen read -- only kisses and a bit of groping -- and the strong language (""whore,"" ""bitch,"" ""hell,"" ""bastards,"" ""ass,"" ""damn"") is pretty infrequent as well. Lia, the princess in hiding, finds her outspokenness often gets her into trouble, but her insistence on living life on her own terms will resonate with teen readers.

 ","Harry books are perennial favorites with preschoolers. An I Can Read Book, divided into four chapters, HARRY AND THE LADY NEXT DOOR follows Harry's efforts to deal with a constantly singing neighbor. The chapter division allows for shorter or longer reading sessions and also provides a reading progression: The first three, shorter chapters lead up to the longer and slightly more text-heavy final chapter.
Parents will welcome a volume that builds on this popularity to encourage early reading, though readers who love Harry for being a real dog may feel that, in this outing, he comes a little too close to anthropomorphic behavior.","Parents need to know that the story produces the requisite suspense, but not enough to hold the interest of some children.

The Square Root of Summer,Physics and grief mix in sweet story of love and loss.,"Margot Oppenheimer, or ""Gottie,"" as she is known to those closest to her, feels surrounded and consumed by loss. Her mother died shortly after giving birth to her, her best friend suddenly moved away five years ago, her loving and hilarious hippie grandfather died last year, and her secret love took off shortly after her grandfather's death. As Gottie withdraws into herself, unable to deal with these problems, she starts to notice what she thinks are openings to black holes and wormholes, shifts in space and time. She occasionally finds herself back in time, reliving past experiences, returning hours later and someplace else. She's a science whiz who tries to figure out what's happening by using quantum physics theories, but it could all be a mental reaction to her grief. Her old friend and her boyfriend both return for the summer, stirring up lots of confusion and emotions in Gottie, which increases the number of odd time and space shifts around her. She realizes that by retreating into herself, she has lost important connections with family and friends. She needs to figure out how to go on living in the present and move forward when things go wrong.
","In this charming story, Gottie's life is consumed with grief, lost love, and quantum physics. Is she really seeing shifts in time and space, or is her grief-stricken mind playing tricks on her? With important losses piling up in her life, Gottie goes practically mute and retreats into herself. When she starts seeing static or blackness where the real world should be, Gottie steps into the abyss and relives past experiences. She delves deeply into quantum physics to explain these phenomena and lost time. The metaphor of grief as a black hole is a good one, as is the question of how much a person should revisit past events. These plot devices make the reader question whether what Gottie is experiencing is real, which is interesting but ultimately ends up a confused jumble at the end of the book.
Yet author Harriet Reuter Hapgood's writing is striking at times. She captures the way teens can be extremely sensitive and caring but also completely self-absorbed. Gottie's struggles with love and hurt are well conveyed. Her pain over being dumped and her confusion over whether her feelings for a childhood friend are reciprocated are beautifully rendered. Teens with an interest in romance will like this aspect of the book the most. The problem with Gottie as a main character and narrator is that she's so inside her own head, repeatedly going over the same events, that the story doesn't move forward enough. The reader gets stuck along with Gottie, which can be frustrating. This is an ambitious book, tackling grief, romance, family, friendships, and complex science, but it tries to cover too much in 304 pages.","Parents need to know The Square Root of Summer is a coming-of-age novel about a smart, science-minded teen girl, Gottie, who's consumed with grief. Shortly after her grandfather dies and her secret boyfriend bails on her, she begins to notice odd shifts in time and space around her. A big part of the book is an ""is it or isn't it real?"" question around these weird happenings. Because Gottie's so into science, there are a lot of physics equations and discussions of quantum physics. Much of the book also deals with love and sexual longing. Even though sex isn't graphically depicted, Gottie often replays memories of her time with her former boyfriend, including sex and making out. Swearing is infrequent and is usually exclamations, including, ""s--t,"" ""f--k,"" and ""balls."" Older teen characters and adults drink, but the book is set in England, where the legal drinking age is younger. One character drinks to deal with his sadness.

As Brave As You,Poignant summer adventure brims with family love and hope.,"Genie and his older brother Ernie are spending four weeks at their grandparents' home in rural Virginia. It's a place so distant from their home in Brooklyn, New York, that the stars seem to multiply, the sun seems hotter, and the sky looks bigger. It's also a place without cell phone coverage and Wi-Fi. Genie is always full of questions, so many questions that he writes them in his notebook. But he already knows why they have to go -- his parents are trying to save their marriage. So while they head off to Jamaica, Genie is stuck picking peas with his brother (yuck!) and trying to figure out the mystery of his strange grandfather, why his dad won't speak to his father, what's the story behind the creepy house in the woods, and how to be brave when you're scared out of your mind. He suspects he won't find those answers on Google.
","Endearing, relevant, and enthralling, this novel offers a glimpse into the lives of one family in the lazy days of summer and captures the natural shifting dynamic that occurs in families over time. The boys rely on each other when the grown-up world gets to be too much, and their relationship and Genie's openness help the family to heal long-standing rifts. Author Jason Reynolds is a master storyteller. He creates characters that are so real, readers forget they don't actually know Genie, Ernie, and their grandfather.
Reynolds is not afraid to dig into topics others shy away from, yet somehow, in AS BRAVE AS YOU, he balances the weight of those topics with the natural lightheartedness of youth. Genie's character and his observations are funny and insightful and straddle the line between precociousness and typical 11-year-old (mis)understandings. This is a great family read.","Parents need to know that 2017 Coretta Scott King (Author) Honor book As Brave s You, by Jason Reynolds (The Boy in the Black Suit, All American Boys) makes his middle-grade fiction debut in this compelling story of two brothers, age 10 and 13, whose parents drive them from their home in Brooklyn, New York, to spend a few weeks in the summer with their grandparents in rural Virginia. The parents are ""having problems"" in their marriage and are taking time alone to work on them, partly on vacation in Jamaica. The story involves some heavy issues, including the death of a family member, long-term grief, mental illness, post-traumatic-stress disorder, discussion of an elderly relative's blindness, divorce, and gun use. Learning to shoot a gun is mainly presented as a right of passage in country life, so families should be prepared to discuss gun safety.

Calvin,"Quirky, compelling tale of schizophrenic teen on quest.","Seventeen-year-old Canadian kid CALVIN has always had a cosmic connection to cartoonist Bill Watterson and his legendary Calvin and Hobbes comic strip (syndicated 1985-1995) since he was born on the day the last strip ran and his grandfather named him after the character. So, when he's diagnosed with schizophrenia in the wake of a meltdown at school -- caused in part by the sudden reappearance of Hobbes, his long-gone stuffed tiger/boon companion -- he figures Watterson can cure him by drawing a strip of him healthy and Hobbes-less. Soon he's walking across a frozen Lake Erie in hopes of meeting the cartoonist, accompanied by longtime friend Susie and also by Hobbes, both of whom may be hallucinations. The story is written in the form of a letter to Watterson.
","A good knowledge of legendary comic strip Calvin and Hobbes may not be absolutely necessary to appreciate Canadian author Martine Leavitt's engaging, oddball story, but it sure helps. Especially when the narrative switches (as it often does) to the adventures of cartoon Calvin's alter ego Spaceman Spiff in mid-crisis. Fans of the strip will revel in the alternate realities, the shout-outs and the in-jokes, while newbies may be more than a bit at sea. Awkward, brilliant Calvin's probably distorted perspective and constant uncertainty about what's real and what's not are part of what makes the narrative compelling. But real girl or imaginary figment, Susie's the star here, tenacious in friendship and taking no nonsense. What's not to love about things like her exchange with the reclusive ice fisherman who gives the teens some much-needed help:
""Noah: I'm a poet. We need solitude.
""Susie: So as long as you make a poem out of it, it's OK to hurt people?
""Noah: Art is the pinnacle of human achievement.
""Susie: Being a decent human being is the pinnacle of human achievement.""","Parents need to know that Calvin is the story of a Canadian 17-year-old just diagnosed with schizophrenia who embarks on a dangerous midwinter trek across Lake Erie to find reclusive Calvin and Hobbes cartoonist Bill Watterson. In fact, it's written in the form of a letter to Watterson. The teen is accompanied by companions Susie and Hobbes, who (along with assorted perils they encounter) may or may not exist. In Calvin's own mind, the quest makes perfect sense; wiser souls try to keep him safe. Though there's little content that's problematic for younger readers (teens exchange heartfelt kisses, and the strongest language is ""crap""), the story requires a certain maturity and the ability to navigate a narrative that's part mythic quest, part teen romance, part psychodrama, and part hallucination. It also assumes an acquaintance with the Calvin and Hobbes comic strip.

Most of the cases involve finding things that have disappeared -- ballet slippers, kids’ toys, a horse from a locked pen -- and the girls have to keep organized case files and maintain friendships while hunting for clues.  ","The mysteries that the Clue Crew takes on are just complicated enough to have a few twists in each story, but they’re situations a young reader might find herself in. Who put the mean note in the pocket of Bess’s stuffed bear? Where's the doll that went missing at the sleepover? What happened to the recipe for the ice cream contest?
There’s very little social drama among the girls in Nancy Drew and the Clue Crew, which is refreshing.

It's ll about runaway horses and missing gadgets and disappearing snowmen. Any hurt feelings are addressed quickly, and the emotional conflicts only rise to the level of “not invited to her birthday party.”  The Crew members have  reasonable amount of independence for third-graders; they are allowed to walk up to five blocks without an adult or to roam unsupervised at the fair as long as they use the buddy system.

With both beautiful words and illustrations, this chapter book brings the Wainscott woods to life. The constant threat of predators may be scary for young kids, as well main character Bagley's story of how he lost his eye in a run-in with an owl. The memory of the death of parent is a thread throughout the book, which also may upset younger kids. Yet, if your kid can handle these themes, they will love the descriptions of the weasels dancing and the warm messages of love and friendship.

Monsters Love School,Monsters lead way in reassuring first-day-of-school romp.,"Summer's over, and a colorful group of eight little monsters gets ready for Monster School, checking off the school supplies on their list. Then the first day comes. ""What's school for, anyway?"" asks the monster named Blue. ""School is for learning your ABCs and 123s and XYZs,"" says Principal Blinkin (a monster with one eye). ""School is for painting and folding and pasting!"" says Miss Scribble, the art teacher. ""School is for making friends,"" says one of the little monsters at recess. ""School is for reading and writing and spelling,"" says Miss Spel. And so it goes through lunch, history class, book club (with Mr. Reed, the librarian), and music class. A good day is had by all, and Blue shouts on the last page, ""I LOVE MONSTER SCHOOL!""
","The bright colors and cheery monsters will appeal to kids even if they haven't read author-illustrator Mike Austin's previous Monsters Love Colors. This book sweeps the reader up in the excitement of school and all the activities there and touches on kids' fear and apprehension before they start school, as little monster Blue asks, ""What if I get hungry?"" ""What if no one likes me?"" The monsters approach school like a ""big adventure,"" and the happy outcome is very reassuring. ","Parents need to know that Mike Austin's Monsters Love School is the sequel to Monsters Love Colors, featuring cute, enthusiastic, upbeat, not scary monsters' first day at Monster School -- which looks a lot like kindergarten. Moving from pre-school jitters -- ""What if I get hungry?"" ""What if no one likes me?"" -- through an engaging day of classes and recess, this lively picture book is fun and reassuring.

The Magic Faraway Tree Series,Tree filled with silly characters connects to magical lands.,"In THE MAGIC FARAWAY TREE series, Joe, Beth, and Frannie move to a new house next to a forest where they discover a tree full of magical creatures: pixies, gnomes, talking animals, and more. The tree stretches into the clouds and connects tree climbers to an endless number of lands that are swirling above the clouds. Some of the lands are delightfully fun, but some are dangerous -- nd there's always the risk that the land will spin away from the tree and the children will be stuck there forever. In the later two books, a cousin and friend join the three kids on delirious adventures, and the parents are oddly fine with the kids disappearing with strange beings -- Moonface and Saucepan Man -- for an entire day. Each book is like a series of short stories about the different lands, loosely tied together with a quest the kids need to go on.
","While parents may read these books to their kids out of nostalgia, young readers will find plenty to love in these imaginative stories. The Magic Faraway Tree Series is full of gentle adventures that take kids through places most have dreamed about at some point: a birthday party land, a take-anything-you-want land, a land of treats, and more. Even the ""bad"" lands aren't scary -- just places the kids need to get out of in time to get home, or to save a friend in trouble. The language in the series is fun and playful, and the books move at a slow-ish pace so readers have a chance to sink into the details. These are great books for getting kids to dream about fantasy lands of their own, and are just plain fun to read.","Parents need to know that Enid Blyton's The Magic Faraway Tree series is a slow, gentle series of adventures that take place in a magical tree and the lands it connects to in the clouds. Originally published in 1939, the language is lyrical and playful --  slide is called a slippery slip -- nd young readers will probably dream about how the kids are left to play in the woods for an entire day by themselves. The gender roles are pretty standard for the time but slightly out of place today.

The Nameless City,Teens fight to save city in action-packed graphic novel.,"Set in an alternate version of ancient Asia, The Nameless City focuses on two teens -- Kaidu and Rat -- who each love the city but for different reasons. Kai is a warrior in training and the son of a general, learning the arts that will help him protect the city once he's grown. Rat is a child of the streets, an orphan who resents the Dao, the people who conquered her hometown. Together, they work to foil a crime that could destroy the tentative peace that holds the Nameless City together.
","Bursting with kinetic energy, this adventure follows two very different characters as they race through the streets and across the rooftops of an ancient metropolis. Kai and Rat perfectly complement each other: he dreamy and tentative in his actions, she uncompromising in her beliefs and ready to tackle any challenge. Author-illustrator Faith Erin Hicks puts them through their paces with vivid action, expressive drawing, and punchy dialogue.
This volume offers a bit of resolution, but there's clearly a lot more to this tale than its creator is ready to reveal. Readers will want the next installment as soon as possible.","Parents need to know that The Nameless City is the first volume in a graphic-novel trilogy by Faith Erin Hicks, author Friends with Boys and other comics. It's about two teens finding their place in an ancient metropolis. The level of violence is low, but the plot includes martial arts training, a riot, and an attempted assassination.

American Girls,Riveting tale of runaway discovering Hollywood underbelly.,"Anna's home life in Atlanta isn't going so great. Her parents recently divorced, her mom has a new wife, her dad took off for Mexico, she's being forced to change schools for her senior year, and her mom's way more into her new baby son than she is into Anna. Fed up, Anna decides to steal her stepmom's credit card number and run off to Los Angeles, where she'll be far away from her problems. The trouble is, she doesn't realize that she brings her emotional baggage with her everywhere she goes. While in L.A., Anna stays with her sister Delia, a struggling actress. With no money, no job, and no car, Anna ends up spending her days on the sets of movies and TV shows, eventually getting a gig researching the female followers of Charles Manson. This research and her exposure to the seamy side of Hollywood fame open her eyes to her own relationships and issues. Will she be another one of the lost AMERICAN GIRLS, like the washed-up starlets and Manson women? Her challenge is to try to figure out how to fix her life and move forward into adulthood.
","With this smart, funny, and intriguing look at the teen-to-adult transition, author Alison Umminger takes on important themes. American Girls addresses family issues, bullying, the desire to be loved, and the value of women in a looks-obsessed world. The only drawback is that Umminger tries to work in too many ideas, and some of the connections she weaves are a little tenuous and tangled, even though the themes are solid. Anna's research into the Manson Family and their crimes is intriguing but not well realized. Through this research and first-hand exposure to the Hollywood machinery, Anna's eyes are opened to the way women are treated in America. The book raises many interesting questions: How do women end up following someone like Manson? How do women who are beautiful trade on it, and how do they cope when that particular currency doesn't hold as much value as they age? What are the side effects of thinking that feelings of self-worth come from being beautiful? Why does the media make stars out of someone like Charles Manson but leave his victims as footnotes?
Anna can be an infuriating main character. She's sarcastic and funny but in denial about how many unfavorable traits she shares with her mom and sister. It's satisfying to see her wake up to her own behaviors and what goes on in the celebrity culture she finds herself in. Umminger has a good ear for teen dialogue and does a great job of balancing the heavier themes with some teen fun, such as meeting and befriending teen TV stars.","Parents need to know American Girls is a coming-of-age novel that explores personal responsibility, the pitfalls of celebrity culture, and the value of women in a looks-based society. The main character, Anna, makes some bad choices and is snarky and judgmental. She steals her stepmom's credit card number and runs away to Los Angeles to stay with her older sister. The book tells the story of her stay in LA, the Hollywood insiders she meets, her sister's possible stalker, and how she learns about herself and starts to realize the error of her ways. The characters talk about sex a lot, but no sex beyond French-kissing is depicted. The violence, too, is more talked about than shown. For example, Anna researches the Manson Family and talks about some of the murders they committed. There's very little in the way of drinking and drug use depicted. Swearing isn't frequent but includes ""f--k"" and ""s--t.""

Bridge of Time,Clever tale of present-day kids lost in 1864 San Francisco.,"It's the last day of school for San Francisco middle-schoolers/best friends Lee Jones and Joan Lee, but it's a really bad day. First of all, both kids' parents have chosen this moment to announce that they're getting divorced. Also, Joan's parents are moving her to a different school, and the BFFs are worried they're never going to see each other again. Just when things couldn't get any worse, their class field trip to the amusement park gets canceled, and they get stuck going to Fort Point, in the shadow of the Golden Gate Bridge, for the gazillionth time instead. Disgusted, the two sneak off from the group to discuss their troubles, doze off in the fort's lighthouse, and wake up to the fort's cannon firing -- in 1864. Soon they're talking to a strange redheaded young man named Sam Clemens, who tells them quite a bit about how time is a river but isn't so sure how they're going to get back home.
","Lewis Buzbee is a very good, imaginative writer with both an ability to bring history alive and a real insight into the world and concerns of today's bright, engaged kids. Characters Lee and Joan ring true, even in improbable situations. Buzbee is quite fond of Madeline L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time, and readers who find L'Engle too preachy may see a bit of the same going on here. For example, presenting Lee with a future version of himself telling him everybody's much happier after the divorce will strike many readers as smarmy. And not everyone will be satisfied with how the author resolves all the book's issues.
On the other hand, between the well-drawn characters, the history, the time travel, and the sheer local color of San Francisco over several centuries, Bridge of Time offers plenty to reward multiple reads.","Parents need to know that Bridge of Time, Lewis Buzbee's follow-up to his award-winning Steinbeck's Ghost, takes Lee Jones and Joan Lee, two present-day San Francisco middle-schoolers, on an unexpected trip into the city's past and future -- with a young Mark Twain as a tour guide. Adding to the drama: Each kid's parents have just announced that they're getting divorced, and the two friends are about to get sent to different schools. While time travel, history, mysterious strangers, racial discrimination, personal growth, family drama, and Mark Twain's literary career are sometimes an uneasy mix, today's kids may feel right at home in the chaos. Twain witnesses and writes about the fatal beating of a Chinese man by Irish butchers, who later blow up an unoccupied boat, and two shotgun-toting women fire shots at the butchers, but no one is hurt.

If You Grew Up With George Washington,Bite-size chunks of history.,"What was it like to be a child during George Washington's lifetime? What were the bathrooms like? What happened if you got sick? Why did men wear wigs? This book introduces children to the way things were done back then in a question/answer format which makes history lively.
 ","This book is primarily an educational tool, and though many of the facts are interesting, the format may not hold much appeal for young readers who prefer a story. Adults reading it aloud, however, will find opportunities for interaction and discussion that could become quite lively. The artwork is appealing and helps children visualize how our forebears lived and worked. Children will also enjoy the sections that identify a variety of headwear and clothing, and may find it interesting that tobacco was often used as money.
The book is an excellent research resource for children ages 9 and up, and parents can use it to spark an interest in history. It's good, too, for classroom or open-house skits and role-plays. Older children may use it to locate information for history papers and reports, and the brevity of some topics may spark a desire for further exploration.","Parents need to know that the illustrations will help children familiarize themselves with new words. The question-answer format breaks history up into fascinating bite-size chunks.

"The Field Guide: The Spiderwick Chronicles, Book 1",Ideal summer read for the middle elementary crowd.,"Twins Jared and Simon Grace, and their older sister Mallory, move with their mother to a decaying Victorian house in the first of The Spiderwick Chronicles. There they discover a secret room, and clues which eventually lead them to an old, handwritten and illustrated book, Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You.
	The book is filled with details about faeries, boggarts, brownies, and the like, but these are not your Disney fairies -- for the most part they are neither cute nor friendly. At first only Jared is interested, but strange and destructive things are happening around the house, and though their mother blames Jared, his siblings aren't so sure.
","In addition to the quick and fascinating story, these books are pleasurable physical objects as well. They're small and lightweight, with irregularly cut pages, and illustrations on nearly every spread, including a map of the area and a couple of color plates, they have a delightfully old-fashioned feel that fairly cries out to be read. Add to that the short length (107 pages) and fluid readability that will appeal even to reluctant readers without seeming babyish, and you may have the perfect summer read for the middle elementary crowd. And maybe even a few adults, too.","Parents need to know that there is little of concern here, though the mom is mostly irritable and sometimes unfair, and the children's father recently left them. As the series progresses, the themes are a little darker. Parents may want to preview the books going forward for younger readers.

Sci-Fi Junior High,"Convoluted plot, forced humor keep space story from soaring.","Kelvin Klosmo arrives at SCI-FI JUNIOR HIGH with a big reputation: His parents are the most famous scientists on Earth, and his new alien friends assume Kelvin must be the smartest kid in the universe. (He's faking it for the time being, because the genius part hasn't kicked in yet.) As he makes friends and gets over his new-school jitters, an evil scientist is working on a scheme involving a misfired mind-transfer beam, a bunny rabbit, and a dangerous super-energy orb. Kelvin and his friends accidentally stumble into the drama and need to work together to save the universe.
","It's hard to stand out in the crowded field of middle school graphic novels targeted to boys, and this space-adventure entry tries mightily by piling on giggles but never quite gets off the ground. Sci-Fi Junior High is a fun enough romp, lightly held together with a barely there plot and lively artwork. Scott Seegert and John Martin cover familiar territory: There's the large and not-too-bright bully, the annoying younger sister, and the jokes about teachers. There's also the smart and capable girl making overtures to the oblivious hero, who's focused instead on the pretty girl he only sees from  distance.","Parents need to know that Sci-Fi Junior High features a seventh-grader who isn't as smart as everyone around him believes but is challenged to rise to the occasion when the universe is in danger. It's a graphic novel by the author-illustrator team of Scott Seegert and John Martin (the Vordak the Incomprehensible series). There are some cartoonishly perilous situations, plus a touch of potty humor, but it's primarily a middle school story with a supporting cast of diverse aliens.

Emmy & Oliver,Heartfelt romance about childhood BFFs reunited as teens.,"As young children, EMMY & OLIVER were neighbors, best friends, and puppy-love crushes, but everything changed when Oliver's father kidnapped him. Oliver's mother grieved but eventually remarried and had more children. Emmy's parents turned into overprotective hawks, and she was left with an Oliver-size hole in her heart. Ten years later, when Oliver is finally found, he returns to their small California hometown a completely different person -- and the worst part is he doesn't completely remember his old friends. But even after a decade, Emmy feels drawn to the boy she once called her best friend, and slowly they forge an intense but fragile bond.
","Robin Benway's coming-of-age novel is a poignant exploration of first love between two teens still coping from a traumatic childhood event. It excels both at humorous, snappy dialogue and substantive reflection on getting through emotional challenges. Although the book tackles several serious issues, Benway keeps the language and story line accessible for young adult readers. Emmy gets Oliver in a way no one else can under the circumstances, and he encourages her not to hide her ""true"" self (an avid surfer with hopes to go away for college) from her parents. He knows how devastating secrets can be nd how they distance you from those you love.
Obviously, most teens won't understand the nuances of what it means to have been kidnapped by a parent and not even know it for 10 years, but many teens will relate to the idea of divorce changing the way parents deal with you (not to mention each other) and how blended families can occasionally feel isolating to the kids from a previous marriage. And everyone, no matter how old, has felt the heartache of a beloved childhood friendship cut short by an unexpected move. What would've happened if that person had stayed or, as is the case with Oliver, returned years later? Benway is a talented writer who keeps readers engaged with this emotionally satisfying, if occasionally heartbreaking, tale about a beautiful friendship that's lost and then found.","Parents need to know that Emmy & Oliver is a contemporary realistic novel about teens who resume a friendship -- and then a relationship -- 10 years after an unexpected separation. Robin Benway's teen romance explores some tough issues (parental kidnapping, overprotective parents, coming out) but isn't too intense. There is occasional strong language (""f--k,"" ""s--t""), some passionate make-out sessions, and a few scenes of underage drinking. Mature middle schoolers and high schoolers could use it a launching pad for frank discussions with their parents about their passions, interests, and plans.

"I, Coriander","Fairy tale with history, romance, for 10 up.","In the time of Oliver Cromwell, between Britain's Civil War and the Restoration, Coriander lives happily with her father, a successful businessman, and mother, an herbalist and healer. When her mother dies mysteriously, her father is forced to marry Maud, a Puritan woman, to keep on good terms with those now running the country. Moving in with her daughter, Maud soon enough reveals her true colors as a child-abusing fanatic.
Despite the marriage Coriander's father is forced to flee the country, and she is left alone with Maud and her vicious preacher friend, Arise. But she soon discovers there is much more to this whole Cinderella story than she had realized -- her mother came from another world, and Maud and Arise are being manipulated by an evil queen from that world who wants a magical item Coriander's mother left behind.
","Sally Gardner's first novel is a hodgepodge of elements, each interesting in its own right, that never really come together to form a coherent whole. One part is a historical novel about a girl growing up when the Puritans took over England. The second part is a fairy story, with a wicked queen in Fairyland, a prince bespelled into animal form, romance, revenge, and magic. It is the intersection of the two that just doesn't work. 
The author must have had trouble with it too, as she suddenly wraps up the whole thing on the last two pages, with no explanation or reason for things working out the way they do, as if she had suddenly run out of ideas, couldn't get it to work, threw up her hands, and ended with ""and then they all lived happily ever after."" Though erratically paced and emotionally distant, there's a lot of vivid writing here, and perhaps with more experience Gardner will be able to construct a plot that makes more sense.","Parents need to know that there's some child abuse, not described in detail, but strongly referred to, some done by a mother to her daughter, and some by a preacher.

Illusions of Fate,Romantic page-turner has stellar heroine of color.,"Jessamin left the island of Melei for an education in Albion. She was aware that there would be prejudice against her for being a dark-skinned, intelligent woman from one of the Albion colonies but still didn't realize life would be so hard. She can't afford the dorms, works with her cousin at a hotel, and barely gets enough to eat. Heading home late one evening, she's cornered by a dockworker in an alley until a mysterious nobleman steps in. Finn takes Jessamin to dinner and is immediately entranced by her but knows he needs to keep his distance. Like all nobles around the world, Finn can wield magic, and he's better than most in Albion. He possesses secret knowledge others desire, and they're looking for a way to make him give up those secrets. But as Finn tries to walk away from Jessamin for the last time, his shadow follows her; a kind of romantic magic he can't control. Now the enemy knows his biggest weakness, and Jessamin's in danger.
","The saddest thing about ILLUSIONS OF FATE is that unless the fates magically turn this into a series, it's the last we'll see of Jessamin, a rather fantastic heroine. She's brilliant and fiercely independent and quite funny, especially when she writes home to her overbearing mother. Finn also is  catch of a mysterious romantic interest. Seeing the sparks that fly between the two -- the dialogue is especially strong -- makes this a real page-turner. The magical world that author Kiersten White creates also intrigues -- with some aspects (the dual shadows, birds that turn into books) intriguing more than others. Some aspects are a little unbelievable, such as Jessamin's lightning-fast grasp of the magical world and how she can manipulate it. Still, the ending will definitely surprise and satisfy.  ","Parents need to know that Illusions of Fate is a fantasy romance from Kiersten White, the author of The Chaos of Stars and the bestselling Paranormalcy trilogy. The violence is pretty mild for fantasy, with a few deaths -- one very sudden -- and the breaking of fingers with a hammer, with the fingers being magically mended shortly thereafter. The romance stays focused on fate and true love with only a couple of kisses. The underage couple drinks champagne and brandy. Girl readers will especially enjoy the headstrong heroine of color who faces prejudice and refuses to hide from danger; she's ready to conquer it with her intellect.

When the Das family moves first to London and then to New York City in the early 1970s, Ranee is intent on seeing that Sonia and Tara, her teen daughters, honor their Bengali heritage and values. Not surprisingly, they have other ideas. As the novel unfolds, Sonia and Tara grow into independent women often in conflict with their mother. Sonia becomes a journalist and a ""feminist, Catholic wife of a Louisiana black man."" Tara moves to India and becomes a Bollywood star. When the story moves to 1998, Sonia's daughter, Chantal, and Tara's daughter, Anna, are both attending high school in New York City.

But unlike their mothers, they have the support of Ranee, who once clung to tradition and strongly disapproved of her daughter's interracial marriage, but is now an independent woman who embraces the ethnic diversity of her family and friends.
","This is a heartwarming, empowering story of generational conflict, mothers and daughters, first loves, feminism, and pursuing your dreams while respecting your heritage. While the first two thirds of You Bring the Distant Near has extremely strong and compelling storylines related by Sonia and Tara, readers may find that the last third, voiced by their daughters, Chantal and Anna, is a bit of a letdown.

While her father begins work at the local clinic, Clare must attend the village school. Though at first she feels out of place as the only non-African student, she immediately finds a kindred spirit in Memory, a smart and fun girl who has experienced loss that Clare can relate to. As Clare settles into village living, she becomes accustomed to eating cooked pumpkin for breakfast, sleeping under a malaria net, and seeing giant monkeys walking the dirt roads alongside people. When a teacher leaves unexpectedly, the principal of her school asks her if she'll help teach English to the first graders.

Pumpkinheads,"Delightful graphic novel about friendship, food, and fall.","PUMPKINHEADS is a contemporary graphic novel about two high school seniors working their final shift together at a seasonal pumpkin patch. After three years of being autumnal besties and co-workers at DeKnock's World Famous Pumpkin Patch and Autumn Jamboree in Omaha, Nebraska, dedicated employee-of-the-month Josiah and free-spirited Deja face their last evening together. Josiah wants a quiet Halloween shift at the Succotash Hut, but Deja has a plan for the two of them to work in a new location, eat all of their favorite snacks, and encourage ""Josie"" to finally speak to the co-worker he's crushed on for three years, ""The Fudge Girl."" But the night proves to be much more of a bonding adventure than even Deja anticipated.
","This is an utterly charming and heartwarming graphic novel about two lovable besties and the power of friendship, small adventures, and pumpkin patches. Rowell and Hicks are both fabulous storytellers, and the medium works beautifully to capture the spirit of Deja and Josie's last night as pumpkin patch employees. From the opening-page map to the familiar station names (Succotash Hut, Fudge Shoppe, Pie Palace, Kettle Corn Kettle) to the deliciously detailed snack foods (readers should know they will be hungry upon finishing), this is the sort of sweet-as-pie story that middle schoolers and moms alike will adore.
Although the primary plotline revolves around Deja persuading Josiah to talk to Marcy, the Fudge Shoppe worker he's been smitten with for three years, the story goes far beyond that to explore the main characters' personalities, flaws, strengths, and experiences (he's cautious, she's impetuous; he's never been in a relationship, she's had several). The story also explores how bittersweet senior year is, this season walking a fine line between adolescence and adulthood when every big event is the ""last"" before everything changes. But along with the underlying substantive themes, there's a whole lot of fun. There's even a rowdy billy goat on the loose that the protagonists tend to ignore as they snack and make their way across the pumpkin patch. Pumpkinheads is sure to win over even the most jaded of readers.","Parents need to know that Pumpkinheads is a graphic novel collaboration between bestselling author Rainbow Rowell and award-winning author-illustrator Faith Erin Hicks. A tribute to autumn, midwestern United States pumpkin patches, and seasonal high school jobs, this lighthearted relationship comedy follows September and October co-workers and best friends Deja and Josiah as they embark on one final adventure during their last shift at their beloved pumpkin patch. There's some flirting and romance (outgoing Deja has dated a few fellow co-workers, while quieter Josiah has had one crush from afar), including one climactic kiss, as well as some mild punny insults and jokes (""dumb,"" ""lame,"" ""tacky,"" ""gross,"" ""stupid""), but it's a ""clean YA"" pick for younger middle and high schoolers.

Mira's Diary:  Bombs Over London,Time traveler starts to grow up in engaging installment.,"Mira's inherited her ability to time travel from her mother and has learned that her mother keeps going back in time to try to prevent something terrible from happening to Mira in the future. This time her mother asks Mira to pass on information that will affect the timing of America's entry into World War I. But should Mira change something that will affect millions of lives on the chance it will save her own?
","History buffs and Sherlock Holmes fans especially will enjoy this time-travel adventure. Younger readers may find Mira less relatable as she starts to separate emotionally from her mother, and excitement takes more of a back seat to Mira's process of discovering what her life and time-travel abilities are all about. But tweens will root for Mira as she uncovers more of the time-travel mystery, struggles to show her independence, and discovers her ability to control her future.
Author Marissa Moss continues to bring pivotal world events to life in an imaginative and lively manner, with lots of telling details and an engaging, believable narrator. She also provides a story that will interest kids as a straight-up, time-travel adventure while providing lots of food for thought to kids who are ready to engage in the larger world.","Parents need to know that this is the third installment in the Mira's Diary series from Marissa Moss, author of the popular Amelia's Notebook series. Mira's time-traveling adventures continue to teach kids about important events in world history and get them thinking about social-justice issues (this time focusing on women's struggle to get the vote). Mira's in peril a few times: She's hit by a policeman at a protest and grabbed and pulled by the Watcher. She sees blood pouring from a wound, and war injuries are described briefly. A suffragist sheltered wives as young as 12 who were running away from their husbands.

Looking for Miza,Gorilla's tale not as compelling as others in series.,"Over half the world’s remaining 700 gorillas live in Virunga National Park in Congo, where rangers try to protect them from poachers, human visitors, and habitat loss. When baby Miza and her mother disappear in June 2007, park rangers and the gorilla that led Miza’s family troop immediately begin searching for them. Miza is brought back safely, and eventually recovers from her ordeal with the help of family members.
","This should be a compelling dramatic tale, but flat writing and a disjointed narrative make it somewhat disappointing -- a weaker entry in the popular series that includes Knut and Owen & Mzee. The retelling of Miza’s disappearance and recovery lacks suspense and emotional impact -- though that’s partly due to the fact that no one really knows what happened to Miza. The full-color photographs are generally fuzzy, overexposed, or have a digital sheen, but there are a few standouts: kids will delight in the image of a playful gorilla with its feet in the air.
However, there is much to appreciate in this glimpse of gorilla life in the wild, written by Craig Hatkoff with his daughters, Juliana and Isabella. They describe some of the social roles in gorilla families, the unique position of silverbacks, and the challenges facing family leaders. The appendix offers more information on threats to mountain gorillas and organizations dedicated to helping these endangered animals.","Parents need to know this story deals with the disappearance of a baby mountain gorilla and her mother; only the baby is found.

She's a tough-minded, creative-thinking orphan who had a great life with her parents until they died in a car crash, and is now fleeing the orphanage (and two creepy-looking killers) to search for her long-lost grandfather. Sebastian, on the other hand, comes from a family of brilliant, successful nerds, and not only does he follow all rules and never do nything remotely wrong, he pretty much doesn't do anything fun, either. Things change fast as this unlikely duo delves into the Club and its secrets, encountering strange characters and stranger machines.
","Once it gets going, this is a fun, rollicking read, but readers have to be up for a book that chirps, ""Don't you hate stories that end in cliff-hangers?"" and then gives them a doozy. The Door in the Alley is quite full of itself, with boasting, dithering, big words galore, footnotes that have nothing to do with the story, and other distractions that are going to be part of the fun for some readers and an absolute deal-breaker for others.
Protagonists Sebastian and Evie have a lot of appeal (helped by Matthew C. Rockefeller's lively illustrations), as do some of the quirky adults. Nightmare-prone kids beware: The villains -- a man with a melted face, and another with wires sticking out of his jaw -- may come back to haunt you.","Parents need to know that The Door in the Alley is the first book in author Adrienne Kress' series The Explorers, in which 12-year-old Sebastian and 11-year-old Evie -- pursued by creepy, murderous villains -- seek Evie's grandfather, a long-lost adventurer. There's a fair amount of cartoonish violence that some sensitive kids may find upsetting. The ditzy, self-absorbed narrator will delight some and aggravate others, but Sebastian and Evie are appealing protagonists: very different kids who come to appreciate each other, work well together, and have their moments to shine. Lots of vocabulary-enhancing big words here, along with useful information, from the depth of the Mariana Trench to helpful internet search techniques.

"Spin the Dawn: The Blood of Stars, Book 1","Teen unravels secrets of sewing in sharp, unusual fantasy.","As SPIN THE DAWN opens, Maia watches her family absorb the blows of war, as two brothers die and one returns home disabled. Disguised as a boy, she takes her father's place in a high-stakes contest to find a new tailor for the emperor. If anyone discovers she's a girl, Maia will be executed. As the field of contestants dwindles, she must use all of her skills as a seamstress to survive. Luckily, she has the assistance of Edan, an enigmatic enchanter who takes an interest in her. But their budding romance is also a source of danger, as Maia meets a demon who has a hold over Edan.
","Plenty of fantasy heroes are adept with knives and swords, but this unusually engaging quasi-Asian fantasy focuses on a young woman who expertly wields scissors and needles. Author Elizabeth Lim manages to find excitement in dressmaking, as Maia tracks down the materials that will win awards for her creations and competes with rivals who won't hesitate to cheat.
Maia's budding romance with Edan follows a familiar pattern, as she initially mistakes his reserved personality for emotional coldness, and they spend a lot of time talking at cross purposes. Their relationship eventually develops slowly and realistically, and the sacrifices each makes for the other feel justified. The volume ends with a cliffhanger, which is good, because readers will want to follow the further adventures of Maia and Edan. This is a highly promising series -- sharp, witty, and romantic.","Parents need to know that Elizabeth Lim's Spin the Dawn is a fantasy novel, set in a magical alternate version of Asia. It chronicles a young woman's quest to win an imperial sewing contest. There are a few scenes of violence -- sword and knife fights, arson -- but nothing too bloody or disturbing. Swearing (""hell,"" ""damn"") is infrequent. Main character Maia and enchanter Edan develop a romantic relationship and perhaps become physically intimate.

Bill Peet: An Autobiography,Former Disney illustrator shares his life story.,"Discover the story behind the real-life genius who illustrated Peter Pan and Sleeping Beauty for the silver screen. Bill Peet, a former Disney illustrator and the author/illustrator of scores of children's books, weaves a fascinating tale out of his own life story. Hundreds of lively characters, including Disney's own Dumbo and the 101 Dalmatians, dance across the pages of this delightful book.

","With tenderness and affection, Bill Peet spins his life story into a children's tale in this illustration-packed volume. The first half covers Peet's boyhood adventures in the Midwest with enjoyable tales about drawing and fishing. The only element missing from the first part is a deeper sense of how Peet felt during the book's most poignant moments: being teased for not having his father around, and his father's sudden reappearance in his life, an event Peet says ""marked the end of a happy childhood.""
The second half of the narrative mainly details the pressures Peet felt as a Disney employee, as well as his struggle to develop a solo career. Still, it shines a revealing light on the inner workings at Disney, and readers are treated to the tale of how the classic song ""When You Wish Upon a Star,"" from the Disney movie Pinocchio, came to be. With a breezy storytelling style and delightful illustrations, Peet moves readers through the events of his life; although the book runs nearly 200 pages, the drawings take up more than half.","Parents need to know that this irresistible autobiography, written as a simple children's story, boasts lots of funny drawings, including favorite Disney characters.

He's allowed to ride it -- terrifying his family by venturing out to the halls where the humans are -- and has the time of his life. When the human leaves the inn, he gives the motorcycle to Ralph, who befriends other humans, goes on far-flung adventures to new states, and drives more vehicles than just the beloved motorcycle.
","This is a sweet, kind series from start to finish, with plenty of gentle adventure and inspiration for tomfoolery. Who wouldn't want to find a friendly mouse zooming around on a shiny motorcycle or sports car, ready to talk about plans and listen to troubles? Beverly Cleary's Ralph S. Mouse series has a wonderfully even pace: just fast enough to keep more advanced readers' attention, slow enough that readers starting to dig into longer chapter books aren't overwhelmed, and a great read-aloud.

Instructions,Slightly quirky life lessons for the older picture book set.,"This is not really a story at all...more a poetic sounding to-do list for the Puss-in-Boots character, and the reader, who finds himself in the realm of fairy tales, trying to wend his way along the ""twisting path through the wild wood."" Of course, metaphorically, the lessons apply to the real world as well. It begins with instructions about how to get in, then what to do as he encounters various situations: facing the red metal imp posing as the knocker on the door; peering into the deep well that leads to Winter's realm; meeting princesses, the ferryman, wolves, ghosts, eagles, and silver fish. Nestled somewhere in the middle is an almost zen-like moment, where we are all reminded to be true to ourselves. And, the lesson is that knowing ourselves and following the instructions of the wise storyteller will surely send Puss-in-Boots, and the reader, back to the spot where he began. There he (we) can decide whether to ""go home, or make a home, or rest.""
","Gaiman fans have come to expect the unexpected, slightly quirky twist in his books; paired with the illustrations of Charles Vess, his work becomes all the more imaginative and fantastic. This is not a book for readers looking for a warm and fuzzy fairy tale, but will definitely hit the mark with those who yearn to step into the more magical worlds of giants, ogres, and Brothers Grimm. The story evolves in the reader's imagination as Puss-in-Boots encounters dangers and moments of choice any reader of fairy tales will recognize. Because he is given a clue as to what he should do, he is able to make his way through all the scary nooks and crannies as the reader breathes a sigh of relief. The approach is quite original, and promises to snag older readers and draw them back to its pages over and over again. Charles Vess has illustrated several other books by Gaiman, and each time, he brings another level of originality and fantasy to the work. He uses his pen and ink like a magic wand and fills each page with twists, turns, and tiny details that create an eerie kind of spiritual aura perfect for a fairy-tale world full of mystery and looming dangers. Monotone washes enhance the eeiriness. Anyone who appreciates the Arthur Rackhman kind of fairy tale art will find the artistry of this book captivating.","Parents need to know that older readers will find this book intriguing with all its allusions to stories they have most likely read. Most younger kids may find it confusing since it's more a list of instructions for life than a story with a beginning and end. Younger ones may also find the lurking danger on many pages too scary, though nothing scary actually happens. It has previously been published in a collection of retold fairy tales by Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling called A Wolf at the Door.

Opposite of Always,Boy tries to stop girl's death in romantic time-travel tale.,"When OPPOSITE OF ALWAYS begins, high school senior Jack King is infatuated with his best friend's girl. He's a sweet, nerdy kid who's loyal to both of them; he'll never act on his feelings. Then Jack meets Kate, and they fall in love. But their relationship is doomed. Kate has sickle cell anemia. (In people with this disease, the red blood cells are rigid and sticky, and are shaped like sickles. The cells are unable to carry enough oxygen.) Kate dies. Jack collapses and is transported back in time to the night he and Kate met. He finds himself in this loop again and again, trying different ways to get Kate the expensive experimental treatment that might save her life or to spend more quality time with her before she dies. In his desperate attempts to save Kate, can he stay true to his ethics and his other friendships?
","This bittersweet, poetic time-traveling teen romance shows a boy struggling to prevent his girlfriend's death from serious illness. Inspired by the death of a close friend, uthor Justin A. Reynolds has written an intriguing fantasy about the possibility of a do-over, a chance to go back in time and do something -- anything -- to bring a loved one back to life. Opposite of Always benefits from this emotional foundation. It's easy to empathize with Jack's feelings, from his infatuation with his best friend's girl, Jillian, to his respect for his parents, to his love for Kate and his desperation not to lose her. ","Parents need to know that Opposite of Always, Justin A.

Each time, Jack attempts to prevent her death -- including through unethical activities like gambling on a game where he knows the outcome to get the money for an experimental medical treatment. Jack and Kate do a lot of kissing, but the way it's presented is tender and not graphic. One scene implies (vaguely) that they may just have had sex. Jack and Jillian, his best friend's girlfriend, also kiss (with tongue). Jack, an underage teen, drinks shots with his friend's dad, an ex-convict who's acted as his bookie.

"An Ember in the Ashes, Book 1",Gripping romantic fantasy in an alternative universe.,"AN EMBER IN THE ASHES is a dual-narrative fantasy novel that follows two characters in the Martial Empire, an alternate universe with a strict caste system. Laia is a Scholar (the oppressed class) whose brother has been arrested for treason, and Elias is a precocious soldier in the Empire's elite military academy, Blackcliff. Laia joins the underground trying to overthrow the Empire in exchange for their help in getting her brother out of harm's way, but her mission is dangerous: to work as a slave for Blackcliff's ruthless Commandant. Elias, who happens to be the Commandant's estranged son, must compete in a series of trials to be the Empire's next ruler, but secretly he wishes he could run away -- especially when he meets his mother's beautiful and new intelligent slave.
","Despite some derivative aspects and a slow-going start, An Ember in the Ashes has a compelling story line and fascinating, well-rounded supporting characters. (Elias' best friend and classmate, Helene, who's not-so-secretly in love with him, is particularly wonderful.) But it's true that author Sabaa Tahir's novel is bound to remind readers of The Hunger Games (a series of trials with only one winner; one person can fan the flames of uprising), Red Rising (an oppressed minority secretly plots to overthrow their oppressors), and spects of Divergent (strict hierarchy, multiple tests to prove you're brave and worthy).
Readers who prefer fantasies with a heavy dose of romance will cheer at all the longing looks and tender feelings described in the story, but they may be confused by the love ""square"" involving Helene, Elias, Laia, and Keenan, her handsome ""handler"" in the underground. Given who the main characters are, it's no secret who ends up together, but it's rare for an author to expand a love triangle to include a fourth potentially viable love interest. The novel is a treatise on the importance of standing up to oppression and the difference that individuals can make when they work together toward a better future. Unanswered questions leave readers want more, which they'll find in Book 2: A Torch Against the Night.","Parents need to know that An Ember in the Ashes is the first book in an exciting fantasy series by former Washington Post journalist Sabaa Tahir. It's set in an alternative universe with a strict caste system, and the main characters get involved in an effort to overthrow the Empire. There's a lot of violence (torture, executions, battles) and a surprising number of references to rape.

The Tragedy Paper,Thoughtful story about a tragedy teen boy brings on himself.,"As an albino, Tim Macbeth is used to rude stares, but he still cringes inside. He transfers to Irving School his senior year and grows obsessed with Vanessa, a popular girl who seems to like him ... but only when no one is watching. Tim's crush and his self-doubt set him on a path toward disaster. Exactly what happened, and why, is revealed in a series of CDs he recorded and left in his old dorm room for its next resident, Duncan, who returns to Irving still tortured by last year's events. Duncan is trying to move on: He's pursuing the girl of his dreams and tackling his senior project -- writing the legendary Tragedy Paper. He'd like to ignore Tim's story, but can't resist the lure of learning the truth about Tim and Vanessa.
","The twin narrative -- alternating between Duncan's experiences and Tim's flashback -- lends drama to the thoughtfully spun out story. Tim and Vanessa get off to a promising start, and their first encounter nicely captures the awkwardness and earnestness of teens on the brink of adulthood.
THE TRAGEDY PAPER is a decent debut novel, but author Elizabeth LaBan stirs up a lot of material that doesn't seem to go anywhere. Is Patrick really such a bad guy? Is Vanessa befriending Tim or toying with him? Adult authority figures described as strict or aloof turn out to be rather blandly kind. LaBan layers on the ominous foreshadowing, and the reader braces for grim ending a la Ethan Frome. But the climactic event isn't much of a shock and the menace ultimately lacks teeth. The real tragedy is quieter and should resonate with teens: how Tim let his self-consciousness and desire to be accepted get in the way of his better judgment, and how he brought suffering upon himself.","Parents need to know that The Tragedy Paper has some of the hallmarks of boarding school tales: There's a little drinking, some kissing, a fair amount of social stratification, and a lot of breaking school rules. But it's a pretty gentle book overall, and the much-hyped tragedy revealed at the book's end is more thought-provoking than shocking.

His fellow bikers Phoenix, Jake, and (visiting from China) Hú Dié, are helping with moral support and lots of riding. His mom decides to help the effort along by sending all four of them to train with her brother, a famous coach who was a noted racer himself till he lost the use of his legs in an accident. But while the kids are improving their form and stamina on the hills of Carmel, bad guys are bent on securing dragon bone for themselves, and won't hesitate to kill to get it. A few bad guys from Book 1 are still in the picture, some new and scary ones are getting into the act. As the action-packed tale continues, the teens witness murders and abductions, are kidnapped themselves, and have adventures in San Francisco's Chinatown.
","Author Jeff Stone has achieved much success with his exciting, page-turning epics that draw even reluctant readers into the adventure, and LION follows in that tradition. The characters are appealing, with distinct personalities that get a good chance to develop further in this installment -- as does the creative mix of martial arts, mythology, and bicycle racing.
Parents might want to check whether the book's plentiful, mostly cartoonish violence is too much for their particular kid, but in general, Lion's a well-crafted, compelling tale with many positive lessons about friendship, teamwork, perseverance, and trying to do the right thing.","Parents need to know that Lion is the second book of popular author Jeff Stone's series that brings his 17th century Five Ancestors characters and conflicts into today's world. It offers a tasty mix of bike racing, ancient Chinese mythology, kung fu, and teen life that will prove irresistible even to reluctant readers. Picking up where the first volume, Phoenix, left off, it's told from the point of view of Ryan Vanderhausen, who's dealing with the aftermath of his evil uncle's efforts in Book 1 to drug him into athletic perfection with a mysterious ancient substance called dragon bone. With the aid of Phoenix's grandfather, one of the centuries-old Five Ancestors, Ryan's trying to eliminate the substance from his system. The suspenseful page-turner has many positive messages about friendship, loyalty, creative thinking, doing the right thing, and the unexpected importance of everyone's talents. Violence, while mostly cartoonish, is often vivid: The kids witness or experience some violence and hear about lots more, including murders by substance-induced heart attacks, hand-to-hand combat, and gunfire; plus kidnappings, blackmail, and a few bicycle crashes.

"In The Shadow of Liberty: The Hidden History of Slavery, Four Presidents, and Five Black Lives",Incredible history of five slaves of the Founding Fathers.,"Best-selling popular history author Kenneth C. Davis' IN THE SHADOW OF LIBERTY traces the stories five enslaved people who served four of the most celebrated presidents of the early United States. After an excellent overview of the topic of American slavery, Davis begins with the story of George Washington's valet Billy Lee, who was wih the general throughout his entire life and witnessed much of the American Revolution up close. The book then proceeds to the life of Ona Judge, a woman who successfully fled Washington's estate and evaded his attempts to recapture her. Next is Isaac Granger, trusted servant of Thomas Jefferson, a man whose complicated views on slavery have been the subject of much scrutiny and debate. Paul Jennings, who ""was always with Mr. [James] Madison till he died, and shaved him every other day for sixteen years,"" survived the turmoil of the War of 1812, fleeing the capitol building moments before it was burnt to the ground by the invading British army. The final chapter profiles Alfred Jackson, one of many persons held as property by beloved war hero Andrew Jackson for most of his life. All of these individuals eventually gained their freedom, either through manumission (being freed), purchasing their liberty, or escaping from bondage. ","Author Davis' writing is succinct but emotive as he breathes life into a bygone era and offers a breathtaking amount of contextual information in the brief biographies he presents. The timelines included throughout the book are rich in detail and cover the major moments in the history of American slavery, making In The Shadow of Liberty an ideal starting point for any middle or high school student interested in learning more about the founding of the United States and role played by people of African descent.","Parents need to know that In the Shadow of Liberty, by Kenneth C. Davis (Don't Know Much about History), is a heartrending history book for teens about the lives of five enslaved people who served four of the most celebrated presidents in early U.S. history: George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Andrew Jackson. It's a powerful introduction to American slavery, tracing the institution's grim history through the stories of five exceptional individuals who witnessed many pivotal moments in the founding of the republic.

Loser,"A moving, funny, lyrical tale with big appeal.","Donald Zinkoff is Below Average, a condition that most adults would like to pretend doesn't exist, and that far too many children think applies most especially to themselves. He's not disabled, in danger, or orphaned; just clumsy, sloppy, not overly bright, and cheerfully clueless.  He is, in the callous summation of his classmates, a Loser.
Spinelli follows him from early childhood through middle school. It is a story made up of small moments: going to work with his dad, trying (and failing) to make a best friend, answering questions in class, working up the nerve to go into the darkened basement. It's the story, in short, of a perfectly ordinary child.
","Few writers could pull this off -- a book with no villains, no heroes, and little real conflict, which is basically a child development text turned into a novel. Yet it's moving, funny, lyrical, and has powerful appeal for both children and adults. Jerry Spinelli gives his readers a careful, at times humorous, portrait of a kid who is only special to his family, and scatters penetrating insights into growing up along the way. Zinkoff's (no one calls him Donald except his teachers) mistakes and quirks are endearing, since we're seeing them from the inside. And his one real talent, a sunny disposition, keeps his life from seeming cruel when he's not picked for teams, when he's ridiculed and taunted, when he, in short, loses, again and again.
This type of story, of course, has been done often before, though rarely with Spinelli's wit and craft. And we all know the formula -- eventually there will be some great dramatic event, the hero will have his moment to shine, and everyone will realize that he's not a loser at all. But that doesn't happen here. There's a moment when it might, but it's not something a Zinkoff, or a real child, can pull off. And therein lies Spinelli's unusual point -- not that losers are really winners, or I'm ok, you're ok, but that the measuring sticks we chose may not be the only ones there are. And Spinelli has the courage to stick to his point right to the end -- no losers or winners, no heroes or villains, no happy endings or sad ones, just children, and their confusing ability occasionally to connect.","Parents need to know that the main character is a good-hearted kid who endures cruel treatment from his classmates for being a ""loser."" The upside is that he's an utterly loveable hero, and there's so much to discuss here that a family, or a class, could spend days talking it over, which is why it's already a favorite with discussion groups.

National Velvet,Inspiring horse story has small but mighty heroine.,"NATIONAL VELVET, by Enid Bagnold, tells the story of thin, sickly 14-year-old Velvet Brown and how she beats the odds to become an internationally regarded horsewoman. Velvet is a dreamer whose love of horses occupies her waking and sleeping thoughts. Her three older sisters also love horses, but their father, a butcher, can't afford to own animals that don't earn their keep. Mr. Brown's patience is tested when Velvet -- in a couple of surprising ways -- comes to possess several horses that once belonged to neighbors. Velvet's mother, however, was a great sportswoman in her younger days and is quietly supportive of Velvet's dreams. So, Mrs. Brown is taken into Velvet's confidence when the girl and her father's assistant, Mi (short for Michael), come up with a plan to give a fiery horse its chance to shine in the world's greatest steeplechase, the Grand National. 
","Enid Bagnold's National Velvet is written in a somewhat unusual way; frequent shorthand dialogue conveys the intimacy of a close-knit family, but could be difficult to follow for very young readers. However, Velvet's miraculous story is suspenseful and inspiring, and will be especially entertaining to horse lovers.
Velvet's older sisters are very well-drawn at their different stages of maturity, and the youngest of the Brown children, preschool-age Donald, is an adorable, enfuriating toddler, who adds comic relief. This is an entertaining, motivational novel about a young girl's great love for horses, and the way she challenges widely held gender prejudice.","Parents need to know that Enid Bagnold's classic novel National Velvet stands with Anna Sewell's Black Beauty as one of the great books for horse lovers. The story of scrawny, 14-year-old Velvet Brown and her equestrian triumphs inspires young horse riders, and offers an intimate view of family life in rural 1920s Sussex, England. Note that a man commits suicide within earshot (but not view) of a teen girl. There are also suspenseful scenes where adults fear that a child has been injured. A small amount of alcohol is consumed (for medicinal purposes), and a teen couple kiss. National Velvet was adapted to a popular film starring Elizabeth Taylor in 1944. The movie takes some liberties with the plot and characters; for exmple, the Velvet of the novel is thin and homely, whereas in the film, she's Elizabeth Taylor. However, the movie captures the spirit of the novel, and both it and the book are highly enjoyable and moving.

Orphan Island,Wrenching emotional fable leaves many questions unanswered.,"On ORPHAN ISLAND, everyone knows the verse: ""Nine on an island, orphans all / Any more, the sky might fall."" Nine kids live a simple life on a magical isle that supplies all their needs, keeps them all safe, and puts on a spectacular light show in the sky every morning and evening. And, every now and then, there's a Changing, as a boat arrives bearing a little kid and leaves taking the eldest kid away, never to be seen again. When her best friend, Deen, leaves, like all the bigger kids before him, Jinny, now the eldest, questions why the kids have always blindly obeyed this rule, without knowing who made it or why, or what's going to happen to them. Soon, the boat will come for her. Then what?
","This coming-of-age fable of kids on an island has a great premise, relatable characters, nd heartfelt emotions. Also a habit of raising tantalizing questions only to leave them hanging at book's end. Why do the kids come to the island? Where do they come from? Who sends them? Where do the kids who leave go? Where did the books come from, and who's Abigail? You'll wonder all these things and more, but you'll be none the wiser at story's end. Like The Giving Tree, which comes up early on, Orphan Island provokes strong feelings in readers, whether they love it and think it speaks to their innermost heart, or they can't believe they stuck it out for 288 pages for so little payoff.  ","Parents need to know that Orphan Island, by Laurel Snyder (Seven Stories Up), is about a magical island that's home to nine kids. Once in a while a boat arrives leaving a new, little kid and taking the eldest away to parts unknown. As her own turn to leave looms, protagonist Jinny, who's probably about 12, starts to seriously question this blind obedience to the rules nd to wonder about the kids who went before them. Many questions are raised, never to be answered -- which a sequel could solve, but none's been announced. There's a lot of internal conflict (staying vs. going, holding on vs. letting go, being responsible vs. being free, etc.) and emotional turmoil, as well as traumatizing moments presented as simply inevitable, including leaving a wailing child behind forever. All of which can be a bit harrowing for sensitive readers, so we're recommending this for 10 and up rather than the publisher's 8 and up.

Flora and the Peacocks,Gorgeous look at negotiating a three-way friendship.,"Flora has a fan and is dressed in peacock green and blue when she meets two peacocks. She bows in what appears to be an invitation to dance. One peacock is interested; the other looks jealous. Flora tries to bring that peacock into the dance, but then the other looks unhappy. She tries to stop them from fighting and make peace but then gives up. Finally, the peacocks see it's more fun if all three of them play nicely together. ","This beautiful book offers wordless fun and clever play with mirror images, fans, nd flaps, but there's also a strong message about getting along in a trio. Kids know how tough it can be when three friends or siblings play together, so they'll instantly relate to FLORA AND THE PEACOCKS as they work out their issues. It's hard to share, especially when it means sharing your friend with a new friend. Author-illustrator Molly Idle has outdone herself this time with both her square format, gorgeous blue-and-green palette, and ingenious engineering of the flaps and the climactic spread that extends beyond the bounds of the two pages. A pure delight.   ","Parents need to know that Molly Idle's Flora and the Peacocks is the third wordless book about young Flora's graceful and humorous encounters with birds, following Caldecott Honor Book Flora and the Flamingo and Flora and the Penguin. The big difference here is the challenge of befriending two birds at once and dancing around their moods and jealousies. The art is more dazzling than ever, while the personal dynamics are highly relatable.

Watchmen,Retired heroes fight to save themselves in gritty classic.,"When even superheroes need saving, you know you've got a major problem. In WATCHMEN's alternate history, America is on the brink of social combustion. By passing the Keene Act, the government banned vigilante justice, forcing America's greatest superheroes into retirement. Years later, the murder of The Comedian draws old colleagues back into action, but the circumstances behind his death may run far deeper than mere personal vendetta.
","With its sophisticated plot, complex characterizations, and spot-on rendering of the human condition, Watchmen is the quintessential graphic novel. Dave Gibbons' expressive, brooding illustrations complement, not carry, the literary merit of its writing. Poetic in verse and saturated with psychological realism, Watchmen is the only graphic novel thus far to make Time's ""100 Best Novels"" list, an accomplishment that's well earned.
On the flip side, parents may have a hard time stomaching the story's graphic violence and crass dialogue. Watchmen has come a long way from the cartoonish ""POW"" and ""KABLAMO"" of its comic book predecessors. Keep in mind that this graphic novel is meant for mature audiences and is chock full of adult themes and complex issues. That said, Watchmen is a gripping read for any fan of the science fiction or mystery genre.","Parents need to know that Watchmen is a landmark graphic novel meant for mature readers and contains lots of violent imagery, profane language, and events of vigilante justice. Still, author Alan Moore and illustrator Dave Gibbons work together to create a genre-shaping graphic novel that's as engrossing visually as it is in plot.

Playground Day!,Bouncy preschool read with terrific illustrations.,"A little girl races through the park pretending to be animals as she swings and slides on the playground equipment.
","Vivid illustrations really make this book stand out. Fuzzy, textured, and warm, the detailed pictures are rendered almost entirely in carefully torn paper and cut cloth. The result is pictures you long to touch.
If kids look closely they'll see stuffed toys accompany the little girl as she makes her way through the playground, giving hints as to what kind of animal she will be next. Kids who notice this all on their own will feel ahead of the game -- it's a bit like that ""look mom!"" moment when they conquer a new physical feat at the playground.","Parents need to know that there is nothing offensive in this book about a trip to the playground. It may encourage more excitement about creative outdoor play.

"I Am Martin Luther King, Jr.: Ordinary People Change the World","Kid-friendly bio a strong, accessible intro to King's life.","I AM MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.: ORDINARY PEOPLE CHANGE THE WORLD traces King's life from his boyhood in Georgia, where he's stopped from playing with a white friend and can't be served ice cream at the white soda fountain or go to the white amusement park or school. But he loves books and ""big words,"" which he gets to use first as a minister and then as a leader in the civil rights movements where his speeches motivate African-Americans to stand up for their rights and march against injustice. The book succinctly covers the most famous protests he led, and the final two pages include a biographical and civil rights movement time line, as well as black-and-white photos of King and his family and the March on Washington.
","The lively style and kid's-eye view of history as it happened make this brief first-person biography engaging and accessible to young readers. Kids who wonder what life in the segregated South was like or why there's a holiday in King's name will get a better understanding of both from this visually appealing book.
Illustrator Christopher Eliopoulos' cartoony style and comics-like layout, complete with speech balloons, make it easy to read, even though it deals with serious issues and complex history.","Parents need to know that I Am Martin Luther King, Jr. is the eighth book in author and History Channel host Brad Meltzer's Ordinary People Change the World picture book biography series, which includes books on Abraham Lincoln, Jackie Robinson, Rosa Parks, and Lucille Ball. The narrative approach and at times comics-like design of each book is the same: A pint-sized, big-headed cartoon version of the person looking like his or her adult self gives a capsule first-person account of childhood through greatest accomplishments. So here's King, sporting his trademark mustache and wearing a mini-black suit and tie, as a child in segregated Georgia, then a minister, then leader of nonviolent civil disobedience actions and marches to effect change. Police beatings and the infamous water hoses turned against child protesters are referred to but not shown. Sophisticated concepts and vocabulary (""... it was a wake-up call for the nation's conscience"") make this a better bet for kids 7 and up than the 5 to 8 recommended by the publisher. In any case, parents and teachers should be ready to answer questions about this turbulent period of U.S. history.

Going Down Home with Daddy,Beautiful book about a very special family reunion.,"In GOING DOWN HOME WITH DADDY, Lil' Alan, his sister, and parents rise before dawn to drive from the city to Great-Grandma Granny's farm, but he can't sleep in the car because he doesn't know what he's going to do for Granny to mark 75 years of living upon her land. When they arrive t the farm where his daddy grew up, Granny embraces him, his uncle teases him, he visits with his cousins, and goes on a tractor ride. He looks around at the farm, listens to his daddy's stories about the land and the family, eats ""love-made dishes"" of collards, mac and cheese, and okra, and ponders pictures (and the lives) of Granny and Pa as his momma remarks on how his eyes look like theirs. He thinks and he thinks and then -- finally --he knows what he'll do when it's his turn to speak.
","The story and illustrations in this beautiful, powerful tribute to family togetherness will enchant young and old alike. Going Down Home with Daddy tells several stories. Author Kelly Starling Lyons describes a family, its history, and the land that has allowed them to thrive. The story also sweeps across history, acknowledging the Native people who cared for the land before Africans were chained and brought to the continent, and the stain of segregationist Jim Crow laws.
Daniel Minter's gorgeous illustrations link this American family to Africa in its details: Patterns in clothing and animals reflect traditional textile designs, Granny's cowry shell earrings call to mind coastal Africa, and stamped on every page in the background are West African adinkra symbols. The farm staples of okra, watermelon, and cotton are drawn in white and overlay sumptuous reds, oranges, and yellows or vibrant greens and soothing blues. The last picture, featuring Granny's dress and her outstretched hand, may stay with readers the longest. Maybe she's feeding her chickens, or maybe she's offering readers her love like they are family, too. Either way, this book is a treasure for any family bookshelf.","Parents need to know that 2020 Caldecott Honor book Going Down Home with Daddy, by Kelly Starling Lyons and illustrated by Daniel Minter, is a lovingly told story about the power of family. Lil' Alan doesn't know what he'll do to honor Great-Grandma Granny at the family reunion, but, as he observes and thinks about his family's history and the land they're from, he figures out the perfect tribute. Lush art accompanies weighty text of one to several paragraphs per page, so dwelling on the pictures and reading aloud is advised. Lil' Alan, Granny, and the rest of the family model love, cultural and historical identity, and togetherness in a way that feels natural and attainable. All characters are Black, of varied skin tones, with a variety of hairstyles (flat top, cornrows, bantu knots, etc.). Connections to history, African cultures, music, and literature can lead to extended learning. Positive messages about the importance of family and striving for excellence to honor those who came before us make this a perfect pick for family reading.

Dear Killer,Teen serial killer faces moral dilemma in gripping read.,"Trained from a very young age to carry on her mother's serial-killing tradition, Kit killed her first victim when she was only 9. Now that she's 17, her mother has retired from killing and Kit carries on alone. She's been dubbed the Perfect Killer because she never leaves a trace behind. She's proud of her record and even admits to enjoying killing. One day she receives a request to kill a classmate and decides to take on the challenge. When she learns that her intended victim is also the victim of an abusive boyfriend, she begins to question the truth behind what she was always taught, that there's no right and no wrong. As she continues to kill, she comes under the increasing suspicion of the police and eventually must decide between a life forever on the run or forever behind bars.
","Coming as it does from such a young author, DEAR KILLER is a remarkably mature achievement. The narrator's voice is rock solid and believable, and the story is very well constructed and realized. The book's not so much a page-turning thriller as it is a study in morality, but the compelling protagonist-killer and well-paced action hold the reader's interest in a vice-like grip.
A minor flaw that many teens won't notice, but if they do will take them out of the story at times, is the inauthentic vocabulary. The story's set in London, but Kit uses words like ""tennis shoe"" instead of ""trainer."" Her narrative voice lacks any sort of British cadence, and the occasional use of ""arse"" becomes a bit jarring in contrast. Again, a minor flaw, and we have every reason to look forward with high expectations to more from this talented young woman.","Parents need to know that Dear Killer, written by first-time uthor Katherine Ewell when she was 17 (she's still in college at Stanford), takes the reader inside the mind of a serial killer who's a high-school girl and typical teen in many ways. Blood's mentioned a lot and a couple of murders are described, one somewhat graphically. Overall, though, the violence is fairly mild given the subject matter, and the book is much more about Kit's journey to understanding morality and where it comes from than it is about the killing itself.

Chicken Cheeks,Corny rhymes about rear ends redeemed by terrific artwork.,"The bear wants to get to the top of the tree to reach the honey at the top. One by one, a variety of animals climb atop one another to reach it, each time sticking its rear end in the face of the character just below, and each time the rear is given a clever name. They nearly succeed, but \""in the end\"" (and much is made of that phrase), the \""bumblebee bum\"" does them in.
","Vibrant colors, especially contrasted against a deep blue background, and full-paged animals with startled expressions will pull almost any reader into this book. But, though the illustrations are colorful and appealing, without them the story really isn't much of a story at all. The words themselves can be rather corny; however, most kids like silly wordplay, and this book might be a good jumping off spot for playing with rhyming and alliteration.
If you think talking about rear ends and all the different names we have for them is funny, you may think this is a clever book. If you don't, well, then you might want to skip this one.","Parents need to know this book has no substantial story, though some kids might find all the silly references to rear ends entertaining.

The Runaway Dinner,Kids will eat up this zany food chase.,"An ordinary little kid named Banjo Cannon has a problem with his dinner: the everyday sausage, peas, carrots, and fries come to life, run away with the dishes in pursuit, and lead him on a merry chase through the English streets. Various unexpected adventures ensue until Banjo's parents carry him home to a large helping of plum pudding. And the adventure takes off again.
","This book is full of silliness, and to its great benefit, it's cleverly written and illustrated. THE RUNAWAY DINNER is a cross between the story of the wily Gingerbread Man and ""Hey, diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle"" -- especially ""the dish ran away with the spoon"" part. Kids will get a kick out of Melvin, the sausage, as he streaks across town with his culinary entourage. Allan Ahlberg has created a friendly, tongue-in-cheek tone that will make kids want to join in on the fun.
The story moves along briskly while the narrator interjects casual comments and questions about how true the story is, what has happened to this character or that, and how mysterious or fun it's all becoming. The flat acrylic paintings coupled with uncolored, ink-lined drawings are inviting and entertaining. Illustrated by Bruce Ingman, each page looks like a kid's painting and offers plenty to look at, search for, and count.","Parents need to know that food is personified, named, and then eaten in this story.

The House of the Spirits,"Magical novel explores personal, political passions.","THE HOUSE OF SPIRITS takes place in Chile and tells the story of four generations of characters, beginning with the intersection of the del Valle family and the Trueba family before the start of World War I. As a young man, Esteban Trueba becomes engaged to the beautiful Rosa del Valle, who looks strikingly like a mermaid. Later, Esteban becomes a wealthy landowner, or patron. He eventually marries Rosa's sister Clara, the youngest of the wealthy and politically active del Valles, who communicates with spirits and can see the future. Esteban becomes a senator, but his way of life is threatened by political war between the right-wing conservatives he supports and the Marxist underclasses, and then by a violent government takeover by militarists. Meanwhile, the Trueba children follow very different paths in their choice of lovers and careers. Two generations -- Esteban and his granddaughter, Alba -- tell their family's story, which intertwines with the story of Chile's 20th century political struggles.
","Isabel Allende's The House of the Spirits is epic in its personal and political scope, and in its sheer beauty. Her elegant prose weaves easily between the two different points of view in the book: the patriarchal grandfather clinging to the past, and his forward-thinking, soft-hearted granddaughter. All of Allende's characters are complex and beautifully realized. This brilliant novel is a great literary achievement on every level, as it seamlessly intertwines the characters' personal and political passions and the momentous events of their times. ","Parents need to know that Isabel Allende's magnificent novel The House of the Spirits tells the story of four generations of a family in postcolonial Chile, using the literary device of magical realism. The book delves deep into the intersection of complex personal and political issues during a time of warlike struggle between Marxists on one side and capitalists and militarists on the other. There are numerous incidents of rape, torture, and murder, many times (but not always) in the context of the political power struggle. Unrelated to politics, there are a number of unsavory sexual situations: one character photographs deviant sex acts, and some characters have sex with prostitutes (heterosexual and homosexual prostitutes are mentioned). Loving couples have sex as well, within and without marriage. Other potentially disturbing content includes a detailed description of an abortion. Alcohol is consumed, a couple of people smoke marijuana, and a doctor helps one woman recover from addiction to what seems to be heroin.

Half Bad,Exciting witchy fantasy is riveting but grim and violent.,"Nathan is a young witch who lives with his grandmother and half siblings. His father, a notorious black witch, killed the father of the other children and, it's said, persuaded his mother, a white witch, to commit suicide before deserting Nathan. Nathan is the only half black, half white witch he knows and is constantly persecuted for it -- by a council of witches who force him into monthly interrogations and strip searches, and by teen white witches who beat him and worse when Nathan gets too close to their sister. He's warned by an elderly witch to go into hiding before the council subjects him to even worse, but is captured anyway. The council sends him to be ""educated"" by a brutal white witch who locks him in a cage. Nathan realizes he must find a way out before he turns 17. On his birthday, he must be given three gifts and drink the blood of his ancestors to get his witch's gift and keep from going mad. Will his long-absent father finally come for him? 
","For the first two-thirds of HALF BAD, there's no putting it down. Starting the story in the midst of the action was a great choice. Readers wonder how Nathan got captured and who the nasty witch is holding him as they flash back to his childhood. Secrets about his infamous baddie father emerge slowly, making the pages turn faster still. You don't want Nathan to feel so attached to him, but how can he help it? How can it end well for this abused and ostracized kid? It's a nail-biter until he makes his escape.
The last third is still exciting, but it seems more focused on setting up the sequel. The appearance of one character seems too convenient and the disappearance of a few seem too hasty. A minor quibble, though, in a mature fantasy debut that ain't half bad -- more like half brilliant. ","Parents need to know that Half Bad is the start of a fantasy trilogy about witches that the publisher is marketing to ages 12 and up. However, the amount of violence here and the overall edginess of the content make it pretty consistent with books most publishers aim toward the more mature YA crowd; high schoolers, not middle schoolers. The main character, Nathan, endures some pretty horrific treatment. He's beaten repeatedly, held down and branded, held captive with an acid wristband that almost eats through his wrist, given tattoos that pierce down to the bone, and chained to the bottom of a van and forced to sit in his own sick and pee. Fistfights are plentiful and bloody. A war between white and black witches has led to many murders over the years and the atmosphere is hunt or be hunted, and capture, torture, then kill; a dark world to inhabit. After what Nathan endures, he wonders why the white witches can still consider themselves the good side. Other mature content includes a few scenes of heavy smoking by minors and handfuls of strong language, mostly ""s--t,"" with one instance of ""f***"" spelled just like that.

Firegirl,A disfigured classmate teaches stirring lessons.,"Tom is a sweaty, overweight kid at a Catholic school. His best friend is Jeff, who is angry about his parents' divorce and his dad's disinterest. Tom has a crush on pretty, popular Courtney, and dreams of rescuing her as a superhero. An ordinary kid in an ordinary life.
Then his class gets a new student, Jessica, who has been severely disfigured in a fire, and who is in town for skin grafts at the hospital. None of the children know how to deal with her, and Jeff is angry about her mere existence. Wild rumors about her circulate around the school. But Tom gradually establishes a tentative relationship with her during the short time she is in school, a few weeks that change everything.
","If effort toward becoming a better person, coupled with introspective self-examination and criticism, are the hallmarks of adulthood, then this gentle, touching novel is a true coming-of-age story.
Though the title is FIREGIRL, this poignant little book isn't about Jessica, the disfigured burn victim. It's about Tom, and how he tries to deal with her presence in his class and neighborhood, and how doing so changes everything in his life. It's a story in which, as Tom himself says as narrator, ""It wasn't much, really, the whole Jessica Feeney thing. If you look at it, nothing much happened."" In terms of physical events, or plot, he's right. What happens is inside him, and that's what author Tony Abbott delicately chronicles.
Tom is nothing special, just a good kid trying to do his best. And that seems to be the real point -- that goodness is a struggle, and even with the best will in the world it's hard to be sure we've done all we can, or should, do. In trying to be a person, Tom doesn't end up miserable or triumphant, or guilty or satisfied -- he's just changed, in ways that will, no doubt, continue to resonate through his life. ","Parents need to know that this is a sad story about a boy struggling to deal with a classmate who was severely disfigured in a horrible accident. The description isn't graphic, but it is disturbing.

"Ada Twist and the Perilous Pants: The Questioneers, Book 2","Scientific thinking saves the day in funny, kind adventure.","Curious Ada is always researching and doing experiments in ADA TWIST AND THE PERILOUS PANTS, but her hypothesis about why hot coffee smells more strongly than iced coffee and participating in the Great Backyard Bird Count get interrupted by a friend's plea. Rosie asks Ada to save her Uncle Ned, who floated away while wearing his famous helium-filled pants. Ada jumps to help, figuring out how to use his buoyancy to stabilize him, then uses some quick thinking (and her brother’s equipment) to see if her hypothesis works to bring Uncle Ned home.
","Author Andrea Beaty makes science come alive for young readers in a way that combines complex principles, new terms, and funny adventures. Ada Twist and the Perilous Pants puts science at the center of the story in a way that encourages readers to learn the new and advanced vocabulary words sprinkled throughout, and to try to figure out how Ada will help Ned before she figures it out herself. Ada's family and friends (mostly) love her obsession with testing and experimenting, and there are some nice moments when Ada's brain moves so much faster than her mouth and she remembers how important it is to take time to explain herself logically -- s her mom says, to ""start from the start.""
It may seem out of balance that the plot's zany premise is set against such a large amount of hard science, but that's quickly forgotten amid the fun story and vibrant characters.","Parents need to know that Andrea Beaty's Ada Twist and the Perilous Pants is a funny, science-based adventure that's accessible to young readers while pushing them to learn fairly advanced vocabulary and concepts. Second in the Questioneers series of chapter books based on the characters in Beaty's popular picture books, this one has Ada taking on issues of gravity, buoyancy, and backyard birding. It's a fun read, jam-packed with nonstop science and facts and vocabulary, and sibling bickering that seems right on target.

How to Code a Sandcastle,Solid coding lessons fill fun tale of girl and her robot.,"In HOW TO CODE A SANDCASTLE, it's the last day of summer vacation, and Pearl's sandcastles keep getting destroyed -- by waves, by Frisbees, by dogs. So she decides to enlist the help of her robot friend, Pascal. ""He’ll do whatever I tell him -- as long as I tell him in CODE. It’s not secret code -- it’s special instructions that computers understand."" Pearl sequences the task, breaking the big problem into smaller ones, some of which she instructs him to repeat in a loop. Pascal doesn't always understand the instructions; when she sends him out to get decorations, he comes back with a baby's binky. So she creates if-then-else code that specifies the steps more clearly. At the end, they create a moat to protect the sandcastle, and use a loop code to create a whole kingdom.
","This sunny book delivers lots of fun along with its serious computer lesson: Coding's a day at the beach if you use it to build a sandcastle. How to Code a Sandcastle successfully introduces basic concepts by using coding language to demonstrate how to break a simple task into its component parts, which is a good life skill s well as a computer skill. Author Josh Funk includes plenty of humor. The main character's not daunted when a ""flying saucer"" (Frisbee) knocks over her castle, or when it gets an unintended moat (via dog pee). But the lessons aren't just breezy, they're solid, and the pages at the end explain the coding concepts of sequence, loop, and if-then-else more fully.
Illustrator Sara Palacios makes sure the crowd at this beach is racially diverse, with lots of African American beachgoers, and families that are racially mixed. Pearl, the narrator, is way cute in her heart sunglasses and springy pigtails, and Palacios cleverly works in illustrations of people absorbed in beach reading, with one newspaper sporting a propos headlines -- ""Programmer fixes bug!"" and ""Memory leak disaster!"" -- and a magazine with a photo of an African American subject. The lesson goes down as easily as a refreshing ice pop on a hot beach day, and it's just as welcome.","Parents need to know that How to Code a Sandcastle is by Josh Funk, a professional software engineer who also writes kids' books, and illustrated by Sara Palacios. The book's a collaboration with the nonprofit organization Girls Who Code, and opens with a note from the founder, cheering on the idea of familiarizing kids at any early age with basic coding concepts, the way you'd introduce ""animals, history, and space."" It uses a real-world application -- building a sandcastle -- to introduce the coding steps sequence, loop, and if-then-else, showing how to break the task into its component parts. The book works for all kids, but since the main character's a girl who's African American, it definitely welcomes girls and kids of color to the coding party.

Avalanche,Snowball journeys through alphabet in fun book.,"A snowball takes a journey through the alphabet, through time, and through space as it gathers all in its path on the way to becoming an avalanche of merry verse. Michael J. Rosen has given the alphabet slaphappy treatment, while David Butler has put an equally happy-go-lucky spin on his fine collage artwork.
 ","Though Michael Rosen's verse may take some explaining to young readers, it more than repays the effort. With lines like ""And so the Vacuum in the cosmos / clutched this cold compound, / and then rewound it round itself / and hurled it homeward bound,"" the verse's snap and crackle alone will provoke some toe-tapping. That the alphabet is thrown into the bargain seems a good deal indeed.
David Butler's illustrations work beautifully. He uses collage and painting set against what is often a field of sharp color, and depicts the hungry, growing snowball/avalanche to heady effect. He has set the letters off like fireworks by bumping up their relative size and splashing them with color. Younger kids will appreciate the jazzy mood, with a note of emphasis when each new letter is introduced, while older kids can get a sense of the process involved here -- its movement through time and space -- all wrapped up in snow and laughter.","Parents need to know that the trip the snowball takes from being a fist-size clump of snow to eventually swallowing the universe is a joyful thing to share in, both as written and as illustrated.

A Snicker of Magic,Kids try to find town's lost magic in beguiling tale.,"Felicity is sick of always beginning a new school as her mother wanders from place to place. Although she sees words blooming everywhere from objects and people, she is terrified of speaking in public and thinks, ""Making new friends can be harder than fractions."" But then their van lands in Midnight Gulch, where once there was magic. Felicity believes it's still there, hiding. With her new best friend, Jonah, who secretly helps anyone in need, they try to find a way to break the curse and let the magic return.
","A SNICKER OF MAGIC is an imaginative and beguiling book with a very original premise. The girl who sees words sprouting everywhere but is tongue-tied finds her voice while finding the solution to the town's curse. The author Natalie Lloyd sweeps you into Midnight Gulch, where Blackberry Sunrise ice cream evokes memories and people try to help one another. There's a sweetness, without sentimentality, to the assorted eccentric characters, and a hopeful conclusion to the well-woven story. The novel makes you wish that the Tennessee town really existed. But perhaps you only have to look in the right places to find magic elsewhere. The writing is ""splendiferous,"" to quote a favorite word of the two lead characters, as evidenced in this passage: ""Someday, when I got brave enough to taste Blackberry Sunrise I hoped that exact memory is the first one I'd think of: The sunset colors stretched across the sky. Tiny red leaves twirled down around us along the wooded path. I wanted to remember Boone's lonesome whistle and the way Cleo's cigarette smoke curled so elegantly, so gracefully up toward the sky. I wanted to remember the way Mama kept looking up toward the clouds, smiling at the birds swooping through the treetops. I never wanted to forget all the ways we were connected that day: by our shadows and sunlight. By pounding hearts and a starry maybe.
""By the nearly silent flutter of our broken wings.""","Parents need to know that A Snicker of Magic is the story of 12-year-old Felicity Pickle, who arrives with her mama, little sister, and dog in Midnight Gulch, Tenn., Mama's hometown. It has a cast of eccentric, lovable characters and an intriguing plot as Felicity and her new friend Jonah, who happens to be in a wheelchair, try to break a curse and bring magic back to Midnight Gulch. Mama has a ""rambling heart"" and is unable to settle anywhere, and Felicity's father has disappeared. Her Aunt Cleo is rarely without a cigarette. Felicity sees words sprouting from people and objects -- including those that reflect people's hidden thoughts and desires -- but is terrified of speaking in public.

The Secret World of Hildegard,"Gorgeous artwork, but too ethereal for many kids.","Hildegard von Bingen was a real woman who lived in the Middle Ages and, as a mystic visionary, did amazing things, especially for a woman in those times. This is an attempt to tell the story of her struggle to accept the mysterious power she was given and have the courage to share the visions she saw. It begins with the disturbing visions that terrify her as a child, and then moves with her to the monastery where she is taught as a young girl. There she learns to accept that her visions come from God, and she becomes headmistress as well as a scientist, composer, author, preacher, and more.
","Another collaboration by Jeanette and Jonah Winter, this book has a beautiful, vibrant cover and is filled with amazing, almost folksy, artwork of the kind found in their earlier book Diego. However, the subject matter here is way too ethereal for most picture book readers, and speaks more to those with specific appreciation for or interest in Christian mysticism, losing the rest of readers.
Of course, the story of Hildegard is a complicated one to tell. But, in an attempt to capture the mystical tone of her life, this telling slips into myth bordering on historical inaccuracy. The language seems as if it comes straight from a Nativity play; while it's supposed to convey Hildegard's religious significance, most kids won't understand it, nor will they make sense of the chant that repeats throughout the book or the language that describes the visions, even though both are presented in different fonts meant to set them apart. All in all, this was a courageous and artistic attempt to write about an unusual woman, but while tweens may be intrigued, The Secret World of Hildegard falls short of its aim. To its credit, however, it includes a bibliography at the end for those who want to do further study.","Parents need to know that this biography only gives part of the story of Hildegard and creates a strange, somewhat terrifying, mystical world that might disturb some kids. The book is quite religious in nature and a better fit for those with a specific appreciation for or interest in Christian mysticism.

Marshmallow,Cuddly read-aloud perfect for bedtime.,"Baby bunny Marshmallow arrives at his new home causing minor -- and resolvable -- disruption for Miss Tilly and cat Oliver.
","There's a reason that this book has lasted so long in print; from the stellar illustrations to the somewhat long-winded but sweet story, it's a picture book that resonates with kids. Miss Tilly brings fluffy bunny Marshmallow home to live with her tabby cat Oliver. The book charts the small family's adjustment to one another with lots of homey details and enough subtle insight to weather repeated readings.
With themes small kids can really understand -- missing mommy, making friends, feeling scared of new situations -- and a perfectly happy ending, MARSHMALLOW is the perfect bedtime read-aloud, especially with the cuddly pictures. The only downside is that the book is long. Some kids won't have the patience to sit through the whole story, but even then parents can use the pictures to pick and choose what to share in the text. Again, try the book at night when kids are winding down and might be willing to listen to a longer story.","Parents need to know that this award-winner from 1943 deserves its classic status.

Reign of the Fallen,Intriguing fantasy explores issues of grief and addiction.,"THE REIGN OF THE FALLEN takes place in the kingdom of Karthia, where young Odessa and her partner/love interest Evander have recently graduated to the rank of master necromancers (something only blue-eyed people of all skin colors can become), after a several-year apprenticeship. As necromancers, they can resurrect the dead, like the reigning king, but there are rules: First, once resurrected, the ""Fallen"" can never be seen by the living; they must remain shrouded, because even a glimpse of their undead selves instantly transforms them into bloodthirsty Shades that kill indiscriminately. Second, those who wish to die-die can just choose not to follow the necromancers back to the world of the living. And third, necromancers themselves can never be resurrected. When a series of Shade attacks begins to worry the Karthians, Odessa and her fellow necromancers Evander, Jax, and Simeon try to fight them off, but when one of them dies, a grieving Odessa finds it difficult to continue and becomes increasingly addicted to a powerful sedative potion. ","While it's not perfect, the fascinating premise and vulnerable-but-fierce protagonist makes this fantasy thriller a compelling enough series starter. Odessa isn't always likable nd she makes plenty of questionable decisions, but that's part of her appeal. She's grieving, and she dulls the pain with a drug that allows her to ""see"" her dead beloved. Not many fantasy books deal with the issue of addiction, much less an addicted protagonist, but Odessa's grief journey is believable and helps readers empathize with her as she attempts to climb out of the depths of her sorrow and do what needs to be done to save Karthia.
What's slightly less believable is Odessa's new romance with the sister of her first love. While that character is beautiful, frank, and courageous, she too is grieving two losses, and the new relationship feels a bit forced and abrupt. Still, it's refreshing for Karthia to be so open-minded and tolerant of LGBTQ citizens (there are heterosexual, lesbian, bisexual, and gay couples throughout the story). The action takes a few unexpected turns but ends up predictably open-ended (albeit not an outright cliffhanger) to ensure interest in the next installment. Supporting characters, particularly Odessa's fellow necromancers Jax and Simeon; Simeon's boyfriend, Daniel, a healer; and Valoria, an inventor/princess, are all so skillfully described that readers will hope there'll be even more of them in the next installment.","Parents need to know that Reign of the Fallen is a young adult fantasy by Sarah Glenn Marsh about the kingdom of Karthia, in which necromancers can resurrect people again and again -- with two major drawbacks: The trained necromancers can't be resurrected, and the resurrected must remain fully shrouded lest they become dangerous, ravenous ""Shades."" The book features some gruesome deaths (at the hands of Shades) and other violent scenes (like when a ruler orchestrates a mass lynching of the Fallen). A pivotal character is killed, and other characters are presumed dead. Two young characters grieve the loss of their loves. The main character becomes increasingly addicted to a sedative; there's some passionate kissing and mentions of sexual relationships.

"Prodigy: Legend, Book 2",Action-packed dystopian sci-fi sequel keeps suspense high.,"PRODIGY picks up exactly where Legend left off, with the street criminal Day and former political insider June having fled future Los Angeles and the tyrannical Republic that rules it. When they meet up with the Rebels working to overthrow the government, they are recruited for an assassination attempt on the newly designated Elector. Having different roles to play, Day and June are separated, only to discover that their assignments are far more complex and dangerous than they've been led to believe.
","Prodigy avoids the sophomore slump, maintaining the narrative energy of Legend, the first volume in this sci-fi series. Author Marie Lu excels in choreographing the action scenes, keeps the level of suspense high, and pulls off a couple of neat plot twists. Some readers may lose patience with Day's and June's fits of jealousy, expecting seasoned freedom fighters to be a little less neurotic and insecure. Others will find the romantic subplots sufficiently compelling.","Parents need to know that Prodigy is an engaging follow-up to the dystopian science fiction adventure Legend. The action centers on an assassination attempt, and there are shootings, fistfights, explosions and a plane crash that ends in fatalities. Most of the violence, however, is at a remove and not described gratuitously. The language is generally mild, with a few uses of ""damn,"" ""hell,"" and ""piss"" and a single instance of ""a--hole.""

The level of physical intimacy, however, does not progress beyond passionate kissing.

This definitely puts a crimp in her budding romance with Fitz, while other love interest Keefe says it won't matter to anyone who really cares about her. Meanwhile, Sophie's got other things to deal with as the evil Neverseen rally their forces and enslave one of her friends, and she finds herself facing the challenges of leadership, enhanced powers, and new possibilities as the characters race headlong to another cliffhanger ending.
","Book 8 in the Keeper of the Lost Cities series ups the ante with a raft of action, character developments, new magical powers, ethical dilemmas, world-saving, and teen romance. By now we're beginning to suspect that author Shannon Messenger has no intention of wrapping up the series in this lifetime, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. This year's doorstop-size volume brings a satisfying immersion in glitter, cosmic conflict, increasingly complex characters, teen anxiety, new magical powers, moral dilemmas, page-turning plot developments, and cliffhanger endings. Sophie and her friends battle evil, question authority, and struggle to do the right thing in impossible situations yet again, and many peripheral characters from previous installments make return appearances.","Parents need to know that Legacy, Book 8 in the Keeper of the Lost Cities series, continues the saga of Sophie Foster, a teen girl who's discovered that she's been genetically engineered by elves for some yet-to-be-determined world-saving task.

Dragon Slayers' Academy Series,Average stories about aspiring knights in medieval times.,"In the DRAGON SLAYERS' ACADEMY series, kids hoping to be knights go to the academy for classes and practical training. Young student Wiglaf, who minstrels proclaimed to be a future hero, is queasy about blood, battles, and confrontation of any kind, and he feels like he'll never fulfill his destiny. Determined, studious Erica is certain she'll be heroic, but has to dress like a boy and go by the name Eric at teh academy because girls aren't allowed to train there. Miserly, conniving Mordred runs the academynwith an iron fist, but is more concerned with amassing more gold than turning out amazing knights. In adventures to caves and castles and unending quests with his classmates, Wiglaf tries to summon the courage to lead, overcome his fears, and intentionally slay a dragon himself.
","This isn't a series that parents will enjoy reading aloud, but kids into knights, dragons, and swordfighting will like seeing how the characters grow from book to book. Dragon Slayers' Academy is a solidly average bunch of knightly tales, with Wiglaf trying to lead and Erica trying to be someone she isn't and the legendary Lancelot making more than one appearance.

Merlin also helps him to claim Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake. Well equipped, Artie, along with his older sister Kay and a few other trusted knights, faces challenges in Otherworld such as a ferocious she-wolf, tornadoes, an evil witch and a dragon, all to bring back the key that will unlock Merlin from his imprisonment in the invisible tower.

","Parents need to know that Otherworld Chronicles: The Invisible Tower is an action-packed adventure story with battles against fight dire wolves, dragons, and all sorts of mythical creatures. The battles are designed to be similar to the first-person video games that main characters Kay and Artie are obsessed with. There's some blood and gore (limbs get severed and blood is spilt; a severed hand plays a pivotal role in Artie's quest), but in general the violence is mild.

Shipwreck at the Bottom of the World: The Extraordinary True Story of Shackleton and the Endurance,Survival saga of attempted Antarctic crossing.,"This is the incredible survival saga of Ernest Shackleton, who attempted to cross the Antarctic continent in 1914, and who, with his crew of twenty-seven, ended up trapped in an ice pack for seven months.
When their ship was finally crushed by the ice, Shackleton and crew survived another five months on the moving ice floes, traveled through storm-tossed seas to an uninhabited island, and were finally rescued, two years after they had set out, when Shackleton and five crew members traveled eight hundred miles in an open boat to get help. Not a man was lost. Includes maps, bibliography, and index.
","This unbelievable story -- the subject of numerous books, articles, and even a museum exhibition -- is enhanced by Jennifer Armstrong's breathtaking prose. From the spellbinding introduction through the epilogue, it is her writing as much as the story that rivets the reader's attention. The tale is a testament to the old-fashioned virtues that made the British such great explorers during the height of their Empire. Courage, fortitude, perseverance, good cheer and humor in the face of disaster, and that uniquely British trait called the ""stiff upper lip"" are all on display, as the crew endures the most punishing setbacks yet ultimately triumphs.
The photos, taken mostly on glass plates by Frank Hurley, survived along with the men, and are of exceptional quality. Along with the text, they provide a you-are-there quality that keeps readers holding their breaths for much of the story. This account is told as the most exciting of adventure tales, the way history for children should be written.","Parents need to know that this book is history as exciting adventure -- better than fictional survival stories, beautifully written, and illustrated with photos that survived from the voyage.

"Island of Legends: The Unwanteds, Book 4","Moral dilemmas abound in thrilling, imaginative sequel.","Just getting his feet under him as Mage of Artime, Alex (and his friends) face challenges on all sides. Forces from Warbler Island attack, exotic sea monsters nearly doom their attempt to rescue Sky and Crow's mother, and they're swept over the edge of the world by forces they've never encountered before. All the while Alex questions his abilities, feels distracted by his blossoming romance with Sky, and struggles with how to balance the demands of leadership and his personal feelings. At the same time, his scheming brother Aaron is regaining power in Quill and rebuilding that evil world, as well as discovering that he may have some untapped power that will make him even more dangerous. How will Alex and his crew ever find their way back to Artime, and what will they find there when they return? ","Author Lisa McMann has a definite knack for writing for this age group. Her use of language is excellent, and her story is compelling. Both believable and unbelievable, the action is fast-paced, the dilemmas are imaginative, and  the solutions border on fantastic. The characters -- even the flying statues -- re complicated enough to seem real; the good guys have weaknesses, the bad guys a glimmer of strength. Lessons about the importance of loyalty, compassion, creativity, and self-acceptance weave subtly throughout.
This series is among the best recent middle-grade fantasy series, and Book 4 is as strong as the first three. A suspenseful ending will leave most readers clamoring for Book 5. ","Parents need to know that The Island of Legends is the fourth book in Lisa McMann's highly acclaimed The Unwanteds series and should be read in sequence. As with the three previous ones, this story is a heart-pounding adventure, full of imaginative challenges and solutions, and peopled with complex characters that grapple with important moral dilemmas. Conflict, magic, fantasy, romance, imagination, loyalty, self-doubt, danger, and evil are effectively balanced, and characters grow and change as they take on leadership roles and friendships deepen. Conflict between warring worlds (a basic good-vs.-evil story line) is part of each book, but violence is never gratuitous. Boulders smash heads, knives are drawn, people are injured during war, and a monster's eye socket is gouged, but no one dies, and the violence is part of unavoidable conflict. There's an innocent kiss or two, hand-holding, and a lot of heart-pounding. Happily for fans, the series continues.

"Trial by Fire: Stranded, Book 2",Pace picks up in second book of Survivor host's kid series.,"TRIAL BY FIRE continues the story that began with Stranded: Four new step-siblings -- two pairs of siblings -- survive a boat crash only to find themselves alone on a deserted island without food, water, or shelter. In this installment, they learn to make fire, build a makeshift camp, and even try to signal a plane they see circling above. They also face constant peril: Jane is knocked down by a stampede of wild boars, while Connor throws up all night after drinking bad water. A revelation lays the groundwork for the next book in the series.
","This installment in the Stranded series moves at a much better pace than the lackluster first book. Readers will quickly move with the characters from one adventure to the next, and they will even learn some things along the way, such as how to make fire without matches -- and the importance of always boiling found water. The authors do a nice job of giving each of the characters his or her own strengths; even un-athletic Buzz has many survival skills, which he picked up from watching reality TV shows. The cliffhanger at the end will certainly entice fans to pick up the next book (due in November 2013).","Parents need to know that this is the second book in a series written by the executive producer of the Survivor TV series. It features four kids -- two sets of siblings whose parents have recently married -- who are stranded on a deserted island after a boat crash. There they face constant peril: Wild boars attack them, one boy gets sick from contaminated water, a brother and sister each fall from a log bridge -- and a girl finds the bones of a human skeleton. While the characters sometimes fight, there's a message here about learning to work together. Readers also get the idea that each person has her or his own unique strengths.

Shoe Dog,Adorable shelter dog learns house rules in charming story.,"A white-haired older lady adopts an adorable shelter dog, and, once he's home, he starts chewing through her shoes -- ""five high heels, four flip-flops, three sneakers, two boots, one wing tip."" She yells, ""BAD DOG!"" and banishes him to the bottom of the big bed. But the next day, when a box of new shoes arrives, he chews through those, too. ""BAD DOG!"" she yells again, and she makes him sleep in a corner. The next day he does the same thing and has to sleep downstairs on a cold floor by the mop. Finally he discovers a box containing a cute cat slipper and refrains from chewing it -- giving it a big ""doggie slobber kiss"" instead. ""GOOD DOG!"" yells the lady, and he's back in her good graces -- and ""on the Big Bed in the Land of Upstairs"" -- curled up to sleep with his ""new-found friend,"" Shoe Cat.
","SHOE DOG is a cute story about an irrepressible pup who has a lot of trouble following the rules and resisting the urge to chew up shoes. Illustrator Katherine Tillotson captures so much personality and emotion in her main character, even though he's drawn as a kind of crayon and charcoal scribble on digitally collaged spreads. Changes in lighting deftly contrast the bright, happy Land of Upstairs with the sad, blue-gray nighttime of the cold floor downstairs where the dog is banished ""with only a mop for a friend."" Art and text work together perfectly s the surprisingly action-packed story moves along and the dog dashes from stairs to bed to ""Comfy Chair"" and closet, sure that he smells some tasty new shoe to devour, and finally leaping into the arms of his happy owner.

Yes No Maybe So,Engaging blend of activism and cross-cultural romance.,"In YES NO MAYBE SO, Jamie Goldberg's and Maya Rehman's mothers think they have a great plan for how the teens should spend their summer -- volunteering on the campaign for a long-shot candidate for Georgia's State Senate. While Jamie likes the idea of getting out of the house and away from the planning for his sister's bat mitzvah, the thought of talking with perfect strangers fills him with horror. Maya's trying to adjust to a new world in which her parents are now living apart and her closest friend is about to leave for college. And it's Ramadan, which means she'll have to spend the day outside in the hot Georgia sun, without eating or drinking until sunset. But they begin going door-to-door, sometimes talking with receptive voters, other times being rebuffed, and once being confronted by a man who makes racist remarks about Maya and Muslims. When they discover a bill has been introduced in the Georgia legislature calling for a partial ban on head and face coverings, they begin printing up and distributing flyers against the bill. As they spend more and more time together, their friends begin to see that something more than a friendship may be developing. But Maya's made it clear that she doesn't see the point in dating anyone, even Jamie. As the campaign comes to a close and the votes are in, it's time for Maya and Jamie to decide what the future holds for them.
","This cross-cultural teen romance that tackles some of the United States' most divisive issues -- hijab bans, the rights of the alt-right, and what constitutes religious liberty. While Yes No Maybe So does give teens real insight into the role they might play in a political campaign, readers with more conservative political views might be uncomfortable with or offended by a storyline in which progressive Democrats are given the moral high ground.","Parents need to know that New York Times bestselling authors Becky Albertalli (Simon vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda) and Aisha Saed (Amal Unbound) have teamed up to coauthor Yes No Maybe So, a teen romance set against the background of a hard-fought political campaign. Going door-to-door canvassing for a progressive candidate for the Georgia State Senate is not the way Jamie Goldberg (who's White and Jewish) or Maya Rehman (who's Pakistani American and Muslim) imagined they'd be spending the summer before their senior year. Much to their surprise, they find they make a great team, both as first-time political activists and as friends. But there's a romantic spark between them that all of their friends can see, even if Jamie and Maya deny it. There's some strong language (""f--k,"" ""crap,"" ""hell,"" ""bulls--t,"" ""a--hole"") by both teens and adults, and one scene with kissing. The storyline pits a good-guy Democrat against a ultra-right-wing Republican, nd in the words of their characters and in the Author's Note, the authors hold nothing back when it comes to their feelings about conservative Republicans.

Trapped in the very walls of power that the rebellion's been struggling against, Amani is in the perfect position to spy on the Sultan -- if she can find someone she trusts to get information to the rebels. As Amani gets to know the Sultan and his plans for the kingdom, the more she starts to wonder if an all-out civil war to get Ahmed on the throne is what her country really needs. Can Amani find people she can trust, and could this be where the rebellion ends?
","This second in  fantasy trilogy trades action and adventure for palace intrigue, but there's still plenty of magic and fantasy for fans to enjoy, and plenty of suspense keeps the pages turning. Traitor to the Throne starts out slowly, with the first hundred or so pages devoted to catching the reader up on past events. The large cast of characters can get confusing sometimes as the reader tries to remember who that character was or who did what and when. But when the continuation of the story comes to the forefront, so do the excitement and suspense.
Fantasy fans who enjoy djinni magic will also enjoy the growing backdrop of Arabian Nights-type folklore. The surprise cliffhanger ending will have fans eager for the next installment.","Parents need to know that Traitor to the Throne is the second in a planned Rebel of the Sands trilogy. It helps to have read the first book. Fantasy violence includes fights with both mortals and magical beings, with weapons such as swords and guns and magical abilities with destructive powers.

There are a few descriptions of physical attraction and a few kisses. Strong language is rare and includes ""ass,"" ""whore,"" ""bitch,"" and ""damn.""

With only two days' worth of oxygen in their tanks, the trio must face drifters, outwit soldiers, and come to terms with the brutal strategies of the Resistance.
","This has many of the components of the modern post-apocalyptic YA novel, but it never quite ignites as a first-rate adventure story. Perhaps it's that the constant threat of suffocation isn't sufficiently compelling or that the point of view is split among three characters, none of whom truly shines as a protagonist.
With a villain named ""Caine Knavery,"" subtlety isn't Breathe's strong suit, and the dialogue and prose would benefit from more originality and less melodrama.","Parents need to know that Breathe is a well-intentioned, if a tad clunky, post-apocalyptic adventure that explores the meaning of freedom after a natural disaster. There's a fair amount of violence -- a beating, some fatal shootings, a knife attack, a riot -- but the depiction of these incidents is neither graphic nor gratuitous.

King Matt the First,Boy king tries to give kids same rights as adults.,"KING MATT is a fable set in the 1920's. Matt is a young boy who becomes the king of a European country when his parents, the king and queen, die. Matt is, most importantly, a child, with all the idealism and ignorance, good intentions and lack of understanding, simplicity and guilelessness which that entails. Though at first he is content, if not very happy, to take lessons from his tutor and do as the government Ministers advise, he soon begins, as any child might, to think that he can do better, especially for the children of his country.
When three foreign countries invade, Matt is thrilled, romantically imagining himself on a white horse leading his soldiers into battle. When he realizes that the Ministers don't even plan to tell him that a war has begun, much less let him lead it, he sneaks off to the front. There, unrecognized, he begins his real education, as he sees what war is really like. But it is only the beginning, for in ending the war, taking control of his government, and instituting a series of reforms, the inadequacy of his knowledge and understanding of the world, of economics, politics, geography, and consequences is made manifest.
Yet despite all of this, he means well, tries hard, learns quickly, and has some successes. Some of his ideas, like giving every kid in the country candy, are silly and childish, but others, like building camps in the countryside where poor children can spend the summer, are more enlightened and practical. His reforms become increasingly grandiose, with destructive consequences which he does not anticipate, and he is increasingly betrayed by the guile and deviousness of the adults who plot his downfall. But though all of his efforts and trials, his sense of responsibility and his simple nobility shine in contrast to the machinations and selfishness of some, though not all, of the adults with whom he has to deal.
","Though obviously impossible, the story is surprisingly realistic, and it deals with the problems and pitfalls of governing a country in a way that is an eye-opener for children. Kids recognize Matt's attempted reforms as the very same ones they would try, and the consequences are as surprising to them as they are to Matt.
This should be read with an adult; there is much in it that cries out for discussion, much that will make the reader angry and frustrated, much that will exercise their notions of fairness, responsibility, laws, rights, and human behavior. It is an exciting story, educational in a way that few books manage to be, and exceptionally thought-provoking. It is recommended not only to parents looking for good books for their kids, but to teachers who want the ideal literature tie-in for any course dealing with law, government, and institutions. It is an important work whose past neglect in America deserves to be remedied.","Parents need to know that this book, written in Poland in the 1920s, is very much a product of its time. Some passages may, by today's standards, be considered by some to be racist. African kings and tribes are depicted, in some ways, as uncivilized and primitive, but the African king is portrayed as morally superior to the white kings. Also, the African king's daughter strikes some pretty convincing blows for feminism.

Summer of Salt,"Sweet but overly quirky mix of magic, mystery, heavy themes.","As SUMMER OF SALT begins, Georgina Fernweh is dreading the end of summer, when she'll turn 18 and leave her island home of By-the-Sea for the very first time. Unlike her twin sister, Mary, and the rest of the Fernweh women who came before her, Georgina has yet to show signs of being magically gifted nd fears she may never get her powers. Also unlike her twin sister, Georgina is terrified of starting college and the social challenges that come with it. She finally has something to be excited about when the seasonal summer tourists arrive at the Fernweh family inn, including the beautiful newcomer Prue, for whom Georgina quickly develops feelings. But when tragedy strikes and a beloved island creature winds up dead, rumors begin to fly and the island descends into turmoil. Georgina begins to question everything she thinks she knows about magic, family, and home, but she'll stop at nothing to uncover the truth. 
","With diverse characters, a quaint setting, and a touch of mystery, this story has a whimsical tone but often feels contrived and muddled. Readers can relate to Georgina and her anxieties about the future as well as her romantic insecurities, which she handles with support from her friends and a fair bit of (occasionally morbid) humor. But the constant angst over her lack of magical powers grows tiresome quickly nd makes her appear uncharacteristically oblivious to the many hints that most readers will pick up on almost instantly.
Despite their relatable qualities, author Katrina Leno overloads her characters with quirkiness, describing their personal aesthetics more than giving them depth. Even the names are quirky and a bit too on the nose -- Fernweh means ""wanderlust"" in German, for example. The dialogue is plagued by overly poetic and offbeat exchanges that seem unrealistic coming from small-town teens. The story's tone is poorly balanced by the main dramatic conflict, and ultimately makes the big reveal(s) feel heavy handed, which lessens their impact. But teens, especially girls, looking for a unique read and positive LGBTQ representation will likely be unfazed by Summer of Salt's stylistic shortcomings nd enjoy its contemporary magical charm. ","Parents need to know that Summer of Salt is a coming-of-age story that blends magical realism, mystery, and romance. It's told from the perspective of 17-year-old Georgina, who struggles with living up to her family's magical legacy and the anxiety of leaving home -- not to mention dealing with the ups and downs of being one of the only out lesbians on the tiny island where she's lived her whole life. Witchcraft and magic are central to the story, with one scene involving a Ouija board. Characters swear frequently, including ""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""bitch,"" nd ""a--hole."" Teens drink and smoke pot at parties, go skinny-dipping in the ocean, and talk about dating and sex. And while this is a romance, that doesn't dominate the story. There's some peril, and a teen wields a gun at one point, but no one gets shot. The plot deals with mature themes like violence and sexual assault, but there are no graphic moments.

As with the other books, the main character is an individual, a girl who insists on wearing ribbons, curls, and all kinds of frilly fancy things. Still she is adventurous, strong-willed, and intelligent. In this instance, she is getting her hands into the dirt, checking out spiders and ants, and showing that exploring nature is fun.
Besides showing just how creative a kid can be, this book also addresses relationships with younger siblings. Nancy struggles with whether Freddy and her sister are mature enough to be part of the club, and how and when to include them.

Little Pink Pup,Tender true tale of a pig being raised by a dog family.,"A piglet named Pink is born premature and in danger of dying on a small family farm in West Virginia. To take better care of him, the family moves him into the house, where he is immediately cared for and accepted by their miniature dachshund, Tink, and her new litter of pups. The mama dog takes care of the piglet as if he is her own, nursing and warming him until he grows healthy. The other pups ""didn’t mind that Pink looked nothing like them—he was just their size.""
","Johanna Kerby, who maintains a blog of the goings-on at her little family farm in rural West Virginia, had the foresight to know a good story when she saw it. She took photos of everything from the piglet's birth to the piglet being nursed by the momma dog. The result is a captivating real-life story that provides a unique lesson about love and acceptance. The writing is clear and straightforward, and kids will delight in the photographs of the adorable piglets and pups.
The illustrations are photographs the author took of the pigs and dogs throughout their journey - including the pig's birth and the pig being nursed by the dog - providing a remarkably intimate view into their lives and story.","Parents need to know that this book won the Book of the Year Award for K-2nd grade at the Children's Book Council's 2011 Children's Choice Book Awards.

"All Our Yesterdays: Cassandra Chronicles, Book 1","Captivating sci-fi tackles time travel, politics, romance.","Cristin Terrill's first novel ALL OUR YESTERDAYS starts out in a prison cell, where a nefarious doctor keeps Em in solitary confinement and has her routinely tortured for information. Her only company is Finn, the guy in the cell next door. Obsessed with a drain in the middle of the floor, Em pries it open to find a to-do list written in her own handwriting with only one ominous task left to complete. To fulfill her dangerous mission, she and Finn must risk their lives to travel back in time. They arrive in the past, where wealthy 16-year-old Marina is hopelessly in love with her neighbor and best friend James, a physics prodigy from a political family. When tragedy strikes, Em and Finn have only a few days to stop a series of events that leads to the creation of the time machine and a totalitarian regime.
","Terrill's debut is an impressive page-turner that explores how tragedy and the desperate desire to fix the past can consume people. The book's two time settings also make it clear how much people can change in just a few years, from adolescence to early adulthood. Em at 20 -- who has survived the unthinkable and doesn't take anything for granted -- doesn't have much in common with her entitled, snobbish 16-year-old self, but her sense of loyalty and her desire to protect the people she loves remain steadfast parts of her character.
Although time-travel plots can get bogged down in the time travel paradox, Terrill explains it away and let's you get caught up in the characters -- both the worldly older versions and the clueless younger versions. She manages to pack in commentary about class (James and Marina are both rich Washington D.C. kids while their prep-school friend Finn is a scholarship student from the 'hood), ethics, and politics. Lest you think it's too heavy a read, Terrill also weaves in two different but equally compelling romantic story arcs featuring a remarkably funny, sweet, and sensitive guy who proves that there's much more to a person than meets the eye.","Parents need to know that All Our Yesterdays is the first in the Cassandra Chronicles sci-fi time-travel series, which follows three characters in the present and in a dystopian near future. There's a good bit of violence in the form of imprisonment, torture, beatings, shootings, and suicide. One timeline features a complicated love triangle, another includes two 20-year-olds  having sex for the first time. Language is occasionally strong (""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""a--hole,"" and more) but not overly frequent. The book brings up lots of issues about friendship, obsession, loyalty and the implications of trying to change the past.

Otis,"Sweet, nostalgic friendship tale with a truly classic look.","Otis is a little red tractor who loves to both work and play on his farm. When a scared calf arrives in his barn, his soft putt-puffs soothe the new arrival and the two become close companions. They enjoy each other’s company until Otis is replaced by a new tractor, and the dispirited old tractor can’t be budged from his weed-covered resting place. The calf, lonely and sad, one day trudges into a muddy pond and gets stuck, sinking deeper and deeper. The harder everyone works to rescue her, the more the frightened calf sinks. All seems lost until her old friend, roused by her cries, putt-puffs to her aid.
","Otis will feel like an old familiar storybook to parents. Author-illustrator Loren Long acknowledges Virginia Lee Burton (Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel) and Robert Lawson (The Story of Ferdinand), and their influence runs deeps here. The subdued palette, strong lines, and soft texture give the book the feel of a classic. The prose flows smoothly and gently, and the illustrations of the cavorting tractor and calf offer plenty of energy and humor.
To his credit, Long doesn’t overdo the arrival of the new tractor: Newer, bigger, and better isn’t necessarily bad, and indeed the yellow tractor continues to be the farmer’s go-to machine. But the farmer and especially Otis learn that growing old doesn’t necessitate being put out to pasture, so to speak.
Lovely, soothing artwork owes a debt to classic children’s books.","Parents need to know that Otis, by Loren Long, is the first in a popular series about a friendly, helpful little tractor. This is a gentle story, but sensitive kids might be anxious during the climactic scene as farmers and firefighters try to save a calf from drowning in mud. All all ends well, of course.

The Alex Crow,Orphan refugee finds new family in beautifully bizarre tale.,"Award-winning author Andrew Smith's THE ALEX CROW, as in his previous book Grasshopper Jungle, is not easy to describe in  sentence or two. It's mostly about Ariel, an orphan who survived a massacre in his village only to end up terrorized in a refugee camp and eventually adopted by the Burgess family living in Sunday, West Virginia. The parents -- Jake, top-level scientist for a secretive research group, and his unflappable wife, Natalie -- have sent Ariel and his adoptive brother, Max, who's only 16 days older than Ariel, to an all-boys, ""no screens"" sleepaway camp. Ariel's story is interwoven with diary entries from a doctor on a doomed 1880s Arctic expedition and an insane psychopath called the ""melting man,"" who believes Joseph Stalin is ordering him to blow up a Beaver King. Oh, and there's also the Burgess' pet, a reanimated crow named Alex.
","Smith is a master at detailing the enormous intellectual and psychological swings of male adolescence. In this case, he focuses on the refugee experience of 15-year-old Ariel, who has experienced the worst humanity has to offer; eight weeks at an unpleasant summer camp for boys without video games, computers, or television is nothing compared with hiding from a massacre in a refrigerator or dealing with amoral ""orphan kings"" in a refugee camp. His story is the heart of The Alex Crow nd by far the most immersive. In his acknowledgements, Smith credits his English-as-a-second-language students for inspiring Ariel, and it's obvious, because Smith never judges what Ariel does or doesn't do to survive. Ariel lives through brutal situations with his dignity and strength of character.
The other two stories (and that pesky suicidal crow) are important to the plot, but they're not as heartbreakingly real. The doctor, one of very few to survive an Arctic expedition, learns what it's like to allow something horrible to happen for his benefit, and the ""melting man"" is a murderous and insane individual who honestly believes Joseph Stalin is talking to him. The 19th-century doctor's story is compelling, but the melting man's can be difficult to read, even though Smith imbues it with occasional humor. Ultimately, this is Ariel's story, one of figuratively dying and being born again. With his brother, Max, a wordsmith who spends most of the book coming up with clever euphemisms for masturbation, and bunkmate Codie, a natural leader who can convince anyone of anything, Ariel finally rediscovers the idea of friendship and brotherhood, something he hasn't felt since the day the rebels came to his village and killed everyone he knew and loved. Smith's books might not be easy to read, but they're easy to love and impossible to forget.","Parents need to know that The Alex Crow is another bizarre, time- and genre-bending coming-of-age story by Andrew Smith, who won a 2015 Michael L. Printz Honor for Grasshopper Jungle. Although Smith once again tackles incredibly tough topics such as civil war, refugee camps, immigration, and bioethics, this is, like all his books, a tale about self-discovery and storytelling: what it costs to tell others about your painful truths. It's also a story about history (and life) repeating itself. There's less sex (although plenty of references to self-pleasure) in this novel than in his others, and there's a noticeable absence of female characters, because the stories are set mostly in an all-boys camp or on an all-male expedition. The language is strong (including ""s--t"" and f--k""), but it's authentic, and Smith is so good that this is the ideal book to introduce to teen boys who think there are no cool books to read.

Fuzzy Mud,"Gripping, taut eco-thriller a thoughtful, satisfying read.","Fifth-grader Tamaya has always been a good kid. When her chaperone for the walk home from school, seventh-grader Marshall, takes a shortcut through the fenced-off woods, Tamaya reluctantly follows. Marshall hopes to avoid a fight with Chad, but the bully tracks them down. Tamaya, to her surprise, hurls a handful of fuzzy mud at his face, and he stumbles off. She and Marshall soon find their way home, but something has changed: Tamaya's hand feels tingly and develops a rash. The next day, Chad is missing, the rash is worse, and soon Tamaya realizes that something far more sinister is at work than a schoolyard bully.
","This slim, quick-moving eco-thriller is a marvel of suspense that pulls you willingly toward certain disaster while smartly sizing up middle-grade angst. In FUZZY MUD, uthor Louis Sarchar shifts perspective and time between chapters, jumping among Tamaya, Marshall, and transcripts of Senate hearings. There's also a touch of humor, with brief but telling character portraits. You don’t spend enough time with any one character for him or her to really hook your heart, but they're all presented with compassionate affection.
The real thrill here is the ecological mystery. Sachar presents the growing menace with chilling turns and touches. The only disappointment is a rushed, overly convenient ending that glosses over the thorny, difficult truths Sachar so deftly handles earlier in the book.","Parents need to know that Fuzzy Mud is both a suspenseful thriller about an ecological disaster and a compassionate study of the shifting social ground of the tween years. Louis Sachar (Holes) carefully explores his characters' simple boxes -- the good student, the bully, the picked-on kid -- to show why they behave the way they do. Parents, school officials, off-kilter scientists -- all are portrayed with empathy. Children avoid getting adult help handling threats and physical danger. The ecological mystery is centered on overpopulation and rising energy demands, raising troubling questions with no easy answers. Several characters become gravely ill, and there's one death.

Cycler,Twisted gender ID tale rife with sex-talk topics.,"Jill changes into a boy every month during her period. It's weird, it's awful, and it complicates the important things in life, like prom, hanging with her best friend, and her crush on Tommy. Things begin to get even more crazy when ""Jack,"" Jill's male alter ego, becomes stronger and stronger and begins to exert his will over Jill's life. Now that Jack and Jill are competing for the same space, things are going to get tough.
","CYCLER starts of with a bang and confusion, and that confusion continues throughout the book. Jill becomes a boy ""Jack"" for four days during her period and the author, Lauren McLaughlin, examines Jill's relationships through both Jill's and her alter ego Jack's eyes. We see her parents' very troubled and dysfunctional marriage, we see a close and sexually charged relationship with her best friend, and the relationship with her crush Tommy. It's easy to see how McLaughlin draws parallels between Jill's confusing relationships and her sexual identity issues.
The book does several things really well: It uses Jill's transformation to grapple with the feelings of teens who are gay, bisexual, or transgendered while highlighting acceptance issues among friends, families, and schoolmates. It's also pretty funny at times. What it doesn't do well is make a case for the ending. It's ambiguous and issues of sexuality aren't resolved in the length of a novel or even a lifetime, but that's being generous. The audience will likely find themselves wanting more of an explanation of Jill's condition, her parents' marriage woes, and more.","Parents need to know that there's underage drinking, a broken marriage, homophobia, sex, bisexual friends, and a girl that transforms into a boy every month during her period (well-described). Yep, you heard right. This book is sure to present questions on gay, lesbian, and transgender lifestyles, as well as questions about sex in general.

The Last to Let Go,"Teen tries to hold family together in sad, beautiful story.","In THE LAST TO LET GO, author Amber Smith tackles the tough subject of domestic abuse and its effect on families. The story centers on Brooke, a high school junior, who is reeling from her dad's death at her mother's hands. Before the killing, Brooke's family was already fractured internally due to years of domestic violence, but after her dad's death, all the cracks are exposed and things start to come apart. With her siblings dealing with the trauma in their own ways and her mother in jail, Brooke works hard to hold herself and the family together. She starts her new academically rigorous high school, confronts her sexuality, and gets a job, all while trying to get through emotionally to her mom, sister, and brother. Eventually, it is all too much for a 16-year-old to manage, and Brooke must face the truth of her situation and how her family's past has shaped who she is.
","A teen girl struggles to keep her family together in this sad but engaging look at the ripple effects of domestic violence. The story has little plot and is slow in places, but author Amber Smith's beautiful, lyrical writing elevates The Last to Let Go above standard YA fare. Brooke Winters, the 16-year-old at the center of the story, is hard to get invested in as a character. Though her pain of being an outsider is well presented, she is so closed off from herself and others, it can make for frustrating reading. Her progression from self-absorbed to self-aware teen is an important part of the book, but it isn't always an enjoyable journey to follow. Along those lines, her mother never explains her decisions or her actions, only saying to Brooke things along the lines of ""You wouldn't understand."" The story would have been better served by showing more of the mom's perspective. Her actions greatly influence the story but the reader never gets to know her.
Smith effectively shows how difficult it is to help people in abusive relationships, the long-term effects of abuse, and how it can be handed down through generations. Each Winters sibling has a different response to and different personal issues resulting from living in an emotional war zone for so many years. The ending isn't tied up in a neat bow, but it is satisfying and realistic.","Parents need to know that The Last to Let Go is about a teen girl, Brooke, trying to hold herself and her family together after their mother kills their father. The story details the many ways domestic abuse affects people for the rest of their lives. Author Amber Smith (The Way I Used to Be) sets the aftermath of the killing against typical teen issues that become anything but typical given Brooke's situation. The story doesn't present the abuse graphically and mostly deals with the emotional trauma of abuse. Brooke navigates a new school, new friends nd romance, and her first job during the hardest time of her life. Characters drink and smoke a little, and swear infrequently (""s--t,"" ""f--k,"" and ""a--hole""). The book provides many good discussion points, including issues around domestic violence, honesty in relationships, and what makes a family.

Quiver,Greek myth has some intense aspects; OK for older kids.,"Atalanta is abandoned as an infant, and the goddess Artemis causes her to be raised by bears. She is then taken in by a village and becomes a great runner and huntress. She takes part in the Calydonian boar hunt, causing the death of several of the huntsmen who argue over her presence there. Upon her return she is summoned by her father, who turns out to be a king, and ordered to marry, even though she is an acolyte of Artemis, pledged to chastity. She agrees to marry whoever can beat her in a race -- but if she wins the man must die.
","This is a straightforward retelling of the Atalanta myth in novel form, and it's enjoyable and action-packed. Though it lacks the humor and cleverness of author Stephanie Spinner's other novelized myth, Quicksilver, Atalanta was never as witty and snarky as Hermes, so the tone fits the subject. This book hews closely to the original stories (and even including an obscure episode that comes after the traditional ending of the myth), making it useful for classes studying mythology.
What humor there is, is provided in the arch commentary of the gods and goddesses that appear from time to time. Spinner also resolves one of the more troubling aspects of the original myth -- that Hippomenes seems to win the race by cheating. In this version, Atalanta clearly knows what he is doing.","Parents need to know that this is a retelling of Greek myth. There are clear sexual references here -- hard to avoid in Greek mythology -- though not really described. There's also some violence (Atalanta kills two centaurs with a bow and arrows, shoots a boar, and forces those who lose races with her to die. A queen hangs herself). The book has a somewhat casual attitude toward death, also typical in myth.

What the Dead Want,Creepy ghost story connects history and horror.,"At the start of WHAT THE DEAD WANT, 16-year-old Gretchen learns that she has inherited a crumbling mansion in upstate New York. When she arrives, she meets her Great-Aunt Esther, a once-famous photographer now turned into a reclusive alcoholic. Also on hand are the ghosts of two mean little girls, who seem eager to hurt anyone who crosses their paths. Gretchen can't leave the Axton Mansion, however, as it may contain clues to the whereabouts of her missing mother. Gretchen stays and struggles to understand the residence's tragic past in order to set its captive spirits free.
","It takes skill to construct a convincing tale of a haunted house, and this contemporary novel with deep roots in the past finds something new to do with the standard horror tropes. What the Dead Want provides a reasonable answer to the question of why someone would stay in a mansion they know to be haunted. Author Norah Olson makes understandable Gretchen's quest to find her missing mother's whereabouts, but she also cranks up the suspense as the plot accelerates to its climax. That Gretchen and her friends are able to solve in a few days a mystery that obsessed her Aunt Esther for decades seems a bit unrealistic, but most readers won't be bothered by that incongruity.","Parents need to know that What the Dead Want is a contemporary ghost story by Norah Olson, set in a haunted mansion with a dark history that dates to before the Civil War. The stand-alone novel includes a number of scary scenes, but the level of horror is not likely to disturb most readers. Ghostly apparitions trip, bite, and send hordes of wasps after unwary victims. There's some swearing (about a dozen uses of ""hell"" and ""damn"" and a few instances of ""s--t""). Teen protagonist Gretchen's great-aunt drinks gin fizzes and smokes cigarettes, as does Gretchen when she's possessed by the old woman's spirit.

Parvana agrees to cut her hair and wear her late brother's clothes to work and shop for the family. She joins up with Shauzia, a former classmate who's also pretending to be a boy, and the two become fast friends. Meanwhile, Parvana's mother recovers from her grief and injuries and, with help from a free-spirited friend, starts working to secure a safe future for her daughters.
","This moving book is n illuminating look into the distressing plight of women and girls under oppressive Taliban rule in Afghanistan and how the spirit of resistance can thrive. In The Breadwinner, Parvana and the women around her help each other discover their strength and start building a lifeline. Author Deborah Ellis presents a strong rebuke of the Taliban while depicting Afghan culture and history with warmth, affection, and respect. Parvana's deepening empathy for her mother and older sister, whose lives were so dramatically upended by the Taliban, is touching, and her clever boldness an inspiration.
It can be grim reading, especially for readers unfamiliar with the Taliban or the oppression of women, and could prompt discussions about security, faith, and gender. It's a surprisingly quick read, and a solid choice for children interested in history and social justice.","Parents need to know that The Breadwinner is about a young girl in Afghanistan who pretends to be a boy so that she can provide for her poor family, defying the Taliban's harsh restrictions on women's freedom. Deborah Ellis first published the book in 2000 as the start of a trilogy, and the 2017 movie tie-in edition includes images from the animated film. Daily life is filled with peril, from beatings and the threat of imprisonment and worse by the Taliban to the fear of accidentally stepping on a land mine. There's a significant amount of violence: physical assaults, brutal punishments, stories of terrible deaths, and dogs devouring bodies. But the takeaway message is about strength, resiliency, and hope. The book ends with an alarming development that leaves Parvana's story very much up in the air, encouraging readers to continue with the trilogy.

Looking for Alaska,Teens process tragic loss in thought-provoking novel.,"In LOOKING FOR ALASKA, Miles, tired of his friendless, dull life in Florida, convinces his parents to send him away to boarding school in Alabama so that he can seek ""the Great Perhaps."" There he meets his roommate and soon-to-be best friend, Chip, called the Colonel, and Alaska Young, the moody, gorgeous, wild girl who instantly becomes the object of his lust. Miles is quickly enlisted in their war against the Weekday Warriors, the rich kids who go home every weekend, and they bond over elaborate pranks, studying, and assorted rule-breaking. About halfway through the book a tragedy occurs, and those left spend the rest of the book trying to make sense of it, to solve the mystery it leaves behind, and to pull off one last, greatest-ever prank.
","This coming-of-age novel is gorgeously written, passionate, hilarious, moving, thought-provoking, character-driven, and literary. It deserves all the awards it's won.

"The Cloak Society, Book 1",Supervillain-in-training tale a good fit for superhero fans.,"As the son of two supervillains in the Cloak Society, Alex Knight and his telekinetic powers are destined for terrible greatness. That is, until he's taken off the Beta Team of junior villains after he botches a bank heist. Not only do his powers fail him when he's trying to crack a safe, his conscience gets in the way when a fellow villain tries to take out a young and kinda cute superhero named Kirbie. Alex saves her just in time. Kirbie is training to be a Ranger of Justice, led by Lone Star, defeater of the Cloak Society in a great battle before Alex was born. Fraternizing with the enemy, without a doubt, is strictly forbidden, especially at a time like this when the Cloak Society is planning the comeback of a lifetime. But if it's only one time -- OK, maybe two -- Alex wonders what harm it would really cause to sneak out and talk to the enemy who owes him her life.
","This is a good fit for the already superhero-crazed reader -- especially one who wants to take a break from knowing what all the do-gooder heroes are thinking and sneak into the head of the villain. Or even think what it would be like to be raised by supervillain parents who want you to grow up to be the ultimate supervillain. Talk about pressure. And a mom who can read your mind? Can't think of a scarier mom superpower for a kid.
	The key characters developed here will probably do a good job carrying the series as it grows. Alex's genius tinkerer friend Gage will definitely come in handy. The vaporizing Misty will, too. There are some missed opportunities for more depth in the story, especially as Alex grapples with his conscience and deals with his demanding parents. Staying closer to the surface gives The Cloak Society more of a TV-pilot-meets-comic-book vibe, which works fine. Kids who only want to see superpowers battle it out will not miss the deep stuff in the slightest, though the effort would have turned pretty good writing into super stuff.","Parents need to know that The Cloak Society gets its name from a group of supervillains who rob a bank with the help of superpowered tweens and teens at the beginning of the story. The main character, Alex, has second thoughts about growing into a powerful supervillain he must grapple with throughout the book. He also senses superheroes in a plane called the Gloom, who have been left there in the dark to waste away. A climactic battle causes injuries and more loss, but little is described. It's mentioned twice that curses are uttered, but the actual words are not used.

We Are Grateful: Otsaliheliga,Warm celebration of Cherokee families' year-round gratitude.,"In WE ARE GRATEFUL: OSTALIHELIGA, Cherokee people say ""Ostaliheliga,"" to express gratitude daily and throughout the four seasons. In the fall, Cherokee New Year, they gather for the Great Moon Ceremony, dance with shell shakers, remember ""our ancestors who suffered hardship and loss on the Trail of Tears,"" and collect brush for weaving baskets. In winter, elders share stories as families eat bean bread and hominy soup, and older kids teach younger ones to make cornhusk dolls and play cane flutes. In spring, men sing to ask for protection for the crops, and kids plant strawberries, gather wild onions, and make moccasins and clay pots. In summer, families catch crawdads and gather for the Green Corn Ceremony and the Cherokee National Holiday.
","All readers can be grateful for the authentic Cherokee representation in this book celebrating contemporary families and their daily, year-round practice of gratitude. If books for kids about Native Americans have been predominantly historical, set pre-1900, We Are Grateful: Otsaliheliga provides a welcome current representation. It's nation specific, written by an enrolled member of the Cherokee Nation, so Cherokee readers will recognize themselves and their families, and other readers can meet relatable kids who are pictured riding bikes, playing in a tree house, launching toy sailboats, and making a snowman, as well as families that gather for picnics, holiday meals, and celebrations.The book is structured around the four seasons, starting with fall, which we learn is the Cherokee New Year, as well as the time of the Great New Moon Ceremony.
The mesh of educational information with everyday detail is an easy weave, and the book includes Cherokee words, and a friendly pronunciation guide, as well as a Cherokee syllabary, and a page of ""Definitions"" that explain some concepts, such as the Trial of Tears, more fully. The art, by Frené Lessac, is brightly colored and appealing, and the book's message -- that it's important to give thanks, ""to celebrate our blessings and reflect on struggles"" -- is universal.","Parents need to know that We Are Grateful: Otsaliheliga is a book about gratitude as practiced by the Cherokee people, written by Traci Sorell, an enrolled citizen of the Cherokee Nation who lives in northeastern Oklahoma, where the tribe's based. The book's been widely praised for its realistic depiction of present-day Cherokee families nd their contemporary culture and celebrations. It sprinkles the text with Cherokee vocabulary, as well as bits of history, referencing the Trail of Tears and the 1839 signing of the Cherokee Constitution. The core Cherokee value -- the daily expression of gratitude -- is accessible and helpful for all.

Professor Gargoyle: Tales from Lovecraft Middle School #1,Humorous homage to classic horror is perfect for tween boys.,"When 12-year-old Robert Arthur starts at state-of-the-art Lovecraft Middle School, he's worried about fitting in and avoiding Glen Torkells, his old nemesis from elementary school. Soon, though, he has other things on his mind, including a missing student, a strange science teacher, and a two-headed rat. If Robert and Glen want to save themselves, the school, and perhaps the entire universe, they have to learn to work together.
","PROFESSOR GARGOYLE: TALES FROM LOVECRAFT MIDDLE SCHOOL #1 is an action-packed, easy-to-read kick-off for a humorous horror series. Author Charles Gilman keeps a light touch on the spookier aspects of the story, and illustrator Eugene Smith delivers drawings that are funny, if sometimes a little frightening. The ""new kid at school"" set-up is a little cliched, but the author delivers some interesting wrinkles on old themes.","Parents need to know that Professor Gargoyle is a fast-paced, funny horror adventure that serves up action, suspense, and comedy. There are in-jokes for readers familiar with the writing of H.P. Lovecraft, and no objectionable language or bloody violence, but there are attacks by rats, tentacles, giant spiders, and a fight with a demon, and a science teacher who consumes a live hamster whole.

Frogkisser!,Bold princess gets a silly nickname in fun questing tale.,"In FROGKISSER! Princess Anya knows the world would thank her if her stepstepfather, the evil sorcerer Duke Rikard, were defeated. Her sister Morven would, too, after the Duke turns one of her suitors, Prince Denholm, into a frog and tosses him in the moat. Anya gives Morven her solemn promise that she'll find Denholm just as the Duke threatens to send Anya away to ""school"" to be rid of her. With the help of Ardent, one of the royal dogs, Anya finds the frog and escapes the castle carrying a complicated recipe for a lip balm that allows a princess such as herself to kiss any transformed creature back to its true form -- without the lovey-dovey part. Anya knows she'll need help getting all the odd ingredients in the recipe as much as she needs help defeating Rikard and fighting off the horde of transformed weasel-men he has sent after her. At every stop she finds robbers, thieves, druids, animals, wizards, and dwarves willing to help and almost as many transfigured animals in need of her magic lip balm. Anya's reputation precedes her everywhere she goes on her quest, and soon Princess Anya is simply known as Frogkisser.
","When an independent princess goes questing in a mash-up of fairy tales and Arthurian legend, you can expect hijinks, but deeper messages of empowerment and community here are a nice bonus. With a title like Frogkisser!, you know the book isn't taking itself too seriously. Princess Anya does have serious intentions of defeating her evil stepstepfather (as she calls him) and learns a lot on her quest about the wider world and what people really need in a ruler and their government. The characters around Anya add a circus atmosphere. Her entourage includes a thief transformed into a giant newt, an otter partly transformed into a human, a frog prince, and a talking, well-educated palace dog.
Garth Nix, who's best known for the much darker Old Kingdom series, has loads of fun introducing oddball characters and world-building here. Sometimes all the clever details slow down the story, but it still wraps up with a fun flourish -- and, no big spoiler, lots of frog kissing.","Parents need to know that Frogkisser! is a humorous fairy tale/knight tale mash-up by Garth Nix, the author of the best-selling (and darker) Old Kingdom series and the Keys to the Kingdom series. The publisher recommends it for age 12 nd up, but it can be enjoyed by advanced readers as young as 10 thanks to its light tone and positive themes. Anya, the questing princess who becomes known as Frogkisser, declares once that ""I don't expect to need rescuing. I'm not that kind of princess."" Themes of empowerment for all people and actively changing what's wrong in your community instead of saying ""someone should do something"" also resonate. Violence is mostly at a distance here, except for once when a weasel-turned-human tries to bite Anya's throat. After that, we hear of about a dozen deaths in battle, including animals, and Anya witnesses one assassin take an arrow to the throat. People fall or are tossed from towers, with one sad death and holes dug into cheeks from an owl's talons. Of course there's lots of kissing, but only once is it romantic. The rest of the time it's about freeing animals with the help of a magic lip balm.

Hero,"True bravery, friendship in suspenseful tale for dog lovers.","Leo spends most of his time imagining he's a gladiator of ancient Rome, until he meets a dog called Jack Pepper. Jack has a knack for making friends, and soon the whole town knows and loves him but none more than Leo. Jack even pulls Leo out of a pond, which Leo fell in while doing something he knew was wrong. Somehow the wrong version of the story gets out, and the whole town thinks it was the boy who saved the dog instead. Leo feels terrible about the lie but doesn't know how to set it straight. One day, a huge sinkhole opens in the middle of town, right where Jack Pepper was waiting for Leo. Can Leo, who's only 11, help find and rescue Jack before it's too late?
","HERO starts out slowly, with frequent repetition of Leo's desire to be, well,  hero, becoming a bit heavy-handed. It also takes a while to create a real sense of place with the confusing use of U.S. vocabulary such as ""trash can"" in what has to be a small town somewhere in Europe. Things pick up considerably when Jack Pepper appears, and eventually author Sarah Lean displays a more authentic ear for dialogue. These flaws are unlikely to bother kids and tweens, though, especially dog lovers. The final third builds nicely, and the pages will keep turning.
The happy ending shows kids what real friendship is nd that growing up takes different kinds of heroism, not only bravery in battle.","Parents need to know that Hero is a dog-lover's story by Sarah Lean, the author of A Hundred Horses. Here Lean explores the human-animal bond through the relationship between 11-year-old Leo and his neighbor's dog, Jack Pepper, with lessons about honesty, true friendship, loyalty, and what it means to be a real hero. There's nothing of concern for bigger kids and tweens, but younger readers may be frightened by the random appearance of a sinkhole in the middle of town that collapses buildings. No one's injured, but Jack Pepper is lost, feared trapped in the bottom of the sinkhole nd possibly dead. Younger kids may need extra reassurance that they're not in danger of falling into a sinkhole as they go about their daily lives.

The Nest,Poignant sick-sibling tale blurs lines of real and imagined.,"As the oldest child in the family, Steve grasps what his parents are going through. His baby brother is home from the hospital but with a mysterious congenital defect that will require many more tests and operations. His parents are stressed and concerned and try to hide it from Steve's little sister, Nicole. All the focus is on the baby until Steve is stung by a wasp on a hot summer day. A small reaction requires a trip to the hospital and an EpiPen. That night he dreams of a creature surrounded by light who tells him words of comfort: They can fix the baby. And after more dreams the creature becomes more real -- too real, resembling the queen wasp that stung him. She is full of comfort and promises and knows things she should never know. How? Steve wonders. What should he believe? Steve's stress and feelings of conflict grow as the queen wasp asks too much of him.
","With expert pacing, hopeful messages of accepting faults and struggles, and creepy tension, it's hard to decide what to like best about this tiny but significant novel. Author Kenneth Oppel, who wrote the equally enthralling The Boundless only a year before THE NEST -- he's really on a roll -- presents a family struggling with the stress of a sick baby through the eyes of Steve, a boy whose age isn't given (but he's probably in middle school). He's anxious enough to see a therapist, washes his hands too often, and is afraid to even say the name of the family's new baby who's come into the house and may not live.
That in itself would be a compelling story in Oppel's hands. But then there are Steve's dreams about the wasps that are way too real. And a scary knife sharpener with missing fingers who goes door to door. And a toy telephone the little sister answers to talk to ""Mr. Nobody."" Readers will be torn like Steve about what to believe is real and who's really on his side. The tension builds right after Steve makes a profound decision about what he stands for. And he's willing to risk his life for it. After readers close the book and the tension of the climax fades, the beautiful themes in The Nest linger. A favorite: that Steve's family will have struggles and his brother won't be perfect but he's part of the family and is loved and valued for who he is, just as Steve is loved and valued.","Parents need to know that The Nest, by Kenneth Oppel (The Boundless) may be a short read that looks fit for younger tweens, but the tone is dark and sometimes nightmarish. The main character, Steve, a thoughtful kid who experiences anxiety and OCD, finds the line blurred between dream and reality, and it will be blurred for the reader, too. Not a dream: His baby brother has a mysterious congenital defect and may die. His parents suffer constant trips to the hospital and worry. What borders on dream and reality: Wasps (sometimes giant in size) swarm, sting, and cause a life-threatening allergic reaction. Despite the story's dark edges, a poignant message emerges about acceptance of challenges and struggles nd being who we are.

Chameleons Are Cool,Simple yet beguiling look at chameleons.,"This simple yet beguiling introduction to one of the world's most wondrous and strange (and, inexplicably, endearing) lizards ably describes the reptiles, covering their more peculiar behavior and their distribution. The book is vividly illustrated by Sue Shields in the fanciful colors chameleons prefer.
 ","You have to hand it to Martin Jenkins for creating a natural-science book that can be successfully deployed with preschoolers. The text emphasizes chameleon facts that grab kids' interest -- changing colors, wild rotating eyes, and just plain wild noses, their grumpiness, and their slow approach, followed by a lightning-quick zap of their quarry -- while the illustrations are as Technicolor bright as the tropics.
One slight drawback is Jenkins' occasional pandering to readers, starting with ""Chameleons are cool."" The inclusion of a young boy in the artwork, in aviator glasses and with his hat on backward, also seems a bit obvious. When this book was read to a library class of 5-year-olds, they immediately began to act grumpy and stick their tongues out at one another. Obviously, chameleons and 5-year-olds share much in common.","Parents need to know that the writing is straightforward, with fascinating information in digestible tidbits.

Wildefire,Violent myth-driven debut OK for fantasy-loving teens.,"Ashline \""Ash\"" Wilde already stands out by being the only adopted Polynesian student in an affluent, all-white New York high school. When her estranged, intimidating older sister Eve comes home and ruthlessly kills Ash's school rival, Ash escapes from her East Coast troubles by boarding at Blackwood Academy, a posh prep school in Northern California. There, a mysterious encounter draws her to five other students. And that's when Ash's real adventure begins: Together, the group discovers they're able to do unbelievable things like control the weather or others' minds. In fact, they may not even be human.
","Readers may find strong Ash a refreshing protagonist: She's not a shy wallflower waiting for a cute boy to help her blossom. Ash knows she's hot stuff, whether she's beating an opponent on the tennis court or flirting with a guy on the dance floor. But she's not sure who -- or what -- she really is for most of the book, and that makes her appealing -- at least when the pace picks midway through the book.  Unfortunately, other characters aren't so well-drawn: Scary big sister Eve is one-dimensional as the unabashed ""bad girl,"" and the author doesn't develop Ash's friends enough to care too much when they're put in harm's way.  First-time author Knight's writing suffers from some clunky prose and unanswered plot holes, but once the action takes off, fantasy-loving teens will be guessing and wanting more -- and hoping for another installment.
 ","Parents need to know that this coming-of-age fantasy features teens with paranormal abilities. Teens should be prepared for some violence: The body count begins in the earliest chapters, and later in the story, protagonist Ash witnesses several deaths, including those of people very close to her. There is also some decidedly PG-13 language, and adolescent lust, romance, and even a high-school pregnancy. Even so, readers might find a role model in refreshing Ash: she's brassy, smart, self-confident -- and loyal.  And they will learn a thing or two as well: The second half of the book turns into comparative mythology 101

","This funny picture book is a delightfully offbeat cautionary tale narrated by main character Magnolia and written in the second person. She speaks directly to the reader, telling ""you"" what not to do -- or else you'll get in trouble and could be sent to the principal's office.

When he decides to make them a snack, the family gets frightened and hides in the bathtub. So Leo decides he'll wander.

When Leo meets a girl named Jane, who can see him, the story turns into a tale of friendship and the power of imagination.

Impostor,Someone sees through Vee's eyes in taut thriller sequel.,"Six months after the conclusion of Slide, life has settled down a bit for Iowa City teen Vee Bell, though she's still troubled by nightmares of the horrific car crash that killed a friend in Slide and still coming to terms with her ability to \""slide\"" into the bodies of other people and see things through their eyes. Then one night, someone apparently \""slides\"" into her and makes her wreck her dad's car, raising new and scary possibilities -- along with the question of the IMPOSTOR's identity. Things only get worse when her long-lost aunt, who looks just like Vee's dead mother, suddenly shows up on the doorstep and makes herself at home. And a gray-haired lady in town seems to know way too much about Vee and her family. Meanwhile, Vee's still dealing with cliques, predatory jocks, and other hazards of high school, while realizing she's in love with her longtime best friend, Rollins.
","Impostor is fast-paced and insightful, with a narrative voice that's snarky, funny, and utterly vulnerable. It spends less time than Slide on the nasty, vicious culture that infests Vee's high school (and ultimately results in a notable body count and assorted tawdry revelations by story's end).
Much of the narrative is Vee's internal monologue as she tries to make sense of inexplicable events from a state of near-Hitchcockian tension and paranoia, not to mention an emotional roller-coaster of romantic and family issues. As such, it may be a bit claustrophobically fraught for some readers. But Vee is worth knowing and is an appealing narrator as she takes us on her journey.","Parents need to know that Impostor, the sequel to 2012's Slide, continues the story of Sylvia ""Vee"" Bell, an Iowa City teen who's able to ""slide"" into other people's bodies and see things from their point of view and who's also dealing with family and high-school issues. Not as violent as Slide, Impostor has only one murder but lots of paranoia as Vee tries to make sense of strange events. There's a fair amount of typical teen swearing (""a--hole,"" ""douchebag,"" ""screw you""), and the sexually predatory jock from Slide is still taking advantage of intoxicated cheerleaders. Vee spends the night with her love interest, but there's no description of their activities beyond passionate kissing.

Ms. Bixby's Last Day,Remarkable story of three boys honoring spirited teacher.,"In MS. BIXBY'S LAST DAY, Ms. Bixby is one of the ""good ones,"" the rare kind of teacher who makes school worth enduring. When a cancer diagnosis forces her to abruptly stop teaching, three of her sixth-grade students skip school to go on a mission to say good-bye. Topher, Steve, and Brand each have been uniquely touched by Ms. B's kindness and empathy, and they want to fulfill one of her wishes before it's too late. Despite their careful plans, nothing goes as it should: For every serendipitous surprise, they run into a demoralizing setback that tests their resolve -- and their friendship.
","This quietly funny and deeply moving story about three insightful boys and their remarkable teacher is a tender, pragmatic coming-of-age story. It's is a departure from John David Anderson's action-packed stories (Sidekicked, The Dungeoneers) and evocative of the boyhood bonding in Stand by Me (but much kinder and gentler for a younger audience). Topher, Steve, and Brand take turns narrating, gradually revealing the heartaches in their home lives and the special ways Ms. Bixby helped them realize their worth and inner strength. It's a magical telling, full of heart, wisdom, and humor that softens the sobering message: Life can be callous, unfair, and blisteringly cruel, but it can be endured with the support of best friends and remarkable people like Ms. Bixby.","Parents need to know that Ms. Bixby's Last Day is an unforgettable coming-of-age story from John David Anderson, best known for lively, fantastical adventure stories (Minion). Three sixth-graders skip school but with the best intentions: to give their beloved, dying teacher a very special last day. Their adventures include obtaining a bottle of alcohol for her, which involves lying and getting into a fight with a dangerous adult, and intimidating another teacher. Jealous bickering sometimes leads to physical fighting, but more often the boys are sensitively attuned to one another. The three boys feel burdened by issues at home -- caring for a disabled parent and running the household; feeling neglected by busy parents; crushed by pressure to excel in school. A parent is depressed and misusing medication. Ms. Bixby is a wonderfully caring, attentive adult figure in their lives.

Foundation,Hugely influential classic mostly for sci-fi fans.,"Tens of thousands of years into the future, humans have colonized planets throughout the Galaxy, and the colossal Empire reigns supreme. Foreseeing that the Empire will soon collapse under its own weight, leading to millennia of chaos and misery, scientist Hari Seldon develops a plan to minimize the damage and bring about a restored Empire in a relatively short period. Part of this plan is gathering the Empire's knowledge into the Encyclopedia Galactica by what becomes known as the FOUNDATION on the planet Terminus. Another part of the plan involves a mysterious Second Foundation, location unknown. In the centuries following Seldon's death, he periodically appears as a hologram to advise leaders of their proper course; meanwhile, patriots, opportunists, warlords, religious zealots, and entrepreneurs look for ways to guide things their way as the Empire disintegrates.
","While there's enough interesting conversation to evoke a spacefaring My Dinner with Andre, many young readers may find Foundation long on talk, but short on action and intriguing characters.
Science fiction is the turf of big ideas; Asimov, with a genius IQ and a broad range of interests, had more big ideas than most, many of them on display here: Is it possible to predict and/or manipulate the future? What about free will? What's the relationship of science, religion, politics, and money? Who's really in control here? Who should be? The downside is that characters, many of whom appear only briefly, are almost exclusively defined by their wise sayings and long speeches, and don't so much develop as tenaciously hold their positions as events unfold. Hugely influential, the Foundation Trilogy (Foundation, Foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation) received science fiction's Hugo Award for Best All-Time Series in 1966, the only year the award's ever been presented.","Parents need to know that Foundation is the first volume of a science fiction series that eventually included not only a raft of sequels, prequels, and spin-offs from author Isaac Asimov, but also much tribute fiction from both fans and bestselling authors. First published in book form in 1951, it consisted of short stories that started to appear in 1942. Its influence extends throughout science fiction, notably in such blockbusters as Star Wars and Star Trek. Following the film success of such Asimov works as I, Robot, Foundation is being developed by Sony Pictures. It addresses many adult issues, e.g. the rise and fall of empires, various forms of mind control, cutthroat political intrigue, and warring cultures. One protagonist lives by the philosophy that ""violence is the last refuge of the incompetent,"" but many factions and characters are all too willing to kill, on the personal and planetary scale, to grab and keep power. Kids who are not already science fiction fans may find this a bad place to start, as character development and action often take a back seat to philosophical debate and speculation.

"Kingdom of the Blazing Phoenix:  Rise of the Empress, Book 2","Exciting fantasy sequel is less dark, more adventurous.","In KINGDOM OF THE BLAZING PHOENIX, we find it's been 15 years since the ruthless Xifeng became empress of all of Feng Lu. Jade, the toddler princess whom Xifeng banished to a remote monastery, is now 18. Jade loves her life in the monastery and wants more than anything to be accepted by the monks there. But she also has no idea who she really is, and doesn't understand why the abbess always tells her that her life is meant for something else. Until a summons to return to the Imperial Palace arrives, that is, and Jade learns who she really is and where her destiny lies. Once returned to the palace, Jade quickly realizes that she's the only one who can end Xifeng's reign of terror. She'll have to escape the palace and find the five relics left scattered across Feng Lu by the ancient dragon lords. But even if she can unite the relics and call upon the ancient gods to return and defeat Xifeng, how will she ever wield a power she never wanted in the first place?
","This sequel and conclusion to a dark fantasy is a compelling read, even though it feels lighter and ramps up the adventure. In Kingdom of the Blazing Phoenix, Jade is a straight-up hero with all the good and admirable qualities you expect from a fairy-tale epic and in sharp contrast to Xifeng's darkness and ambiguity in the first volume, Forest of a Thousand Lanterns. Jade also relies on strong bonds of friendship and never hesitates to accept help and advice from others, which further lightens her hero's journey and makes her a better, more relatable role model by far. Fans of dark fantasy still have plenty of that element to enjoy as Xifeng tries to hold on to her beauty and power. The overall story as a retelling of the ""Snow White"" fairy tale comes more to the forefront, too.
It's fair enough to suppose that in a sequel the author doesn't need to, and probably shouldn't, spend as much time building the story's world and can instead concentrate on character and plot. But the effect of that here is that the world feels less vivid and not as easy to fully imagine. If it's been a while since you read the first volume, it might help cement things in your mind to go back and read it again right before jumping into the sequel. The story definitely comes to an end here, with an epilogue that explains what happens to many of the characters and to the kingdom of Feng Lu in the years following. Best for fantasy fans of epic-quest adventures where danger and magic lurk around every corner.","Parents need to know that Kingdom of the Blazing Phoenix is a fantasy sequel and conclusion to the story begun in Forest of a Thousand Lanterns. Most of the characters are new and it stands pretty well on its own, but reading the first book will give readers a much better understanding and more vivid sense of the fantasy world where the story takes place. It has lots of strong role models and representations of Asian culture, especially for girls. Highly prized and modeled character strengths include integrity, resourcefulness, faith, humility, and determination. Strong bonds of friendship and loyalty are also modeled. Real-world and fantasy violence includes fights and battles with real and fantasy creatures, creepy locations, characters in peril, and mentions of blood with no gore but occasional brief descriptions. Important characters die. A budding romance includes hand-holding, feelings of attraction and emotional intimacy, and a few kisses that aren't described.

Pirates Don't Change Diapers,Energetic and giggly fish-out-of-water tale.,"Jeremy Jacob's mother left him in charge of his sister when his old pirate friends show up. Will he be able to help them find their treasure?
","Readers don't need to be familiar with the first book to enjoy the energetic silliness of this sequel. Every kid loves stories where grown-ups need practical instruction from a wiser and patient child hero -- that's why there are so many out there. And what could be better than an unruly crew of pirates who obey the wishes of a little boy and his baby sister?
The colorful illustrations nicely add to the hilarious chaos of the story.

Stranded,Shipwrecked tweens unite in adventure by Survivor host.,"Vanessa and her brother, Buzz, have a new stepfamily, including Carter and his little sister, Jane. After their parents get married, the four tween stepsiblings go on a sailing adventure with Carter and Jane's uncle so they can bond. But a storm ravages the boat, and the kids find themselves stranded on an island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean with no adults to help them. When the satellite phone stops working and their water runs dry, they realize \""all they really had now was each other.\""
","The author does a good job of weaving in interesting facts about survival and island geography while also presenting each of the characters' strengths and weaknesses. (""Husky"" 11-year-old Buzz, for example, isn't very good at physical challenges but is an innovative problem solver.) There's a lot of setup here as readers learn about each of the step-siblings and experience the devastating storm that takes their boat down. STRANDED is actually about half over before the kids finally get to the island. The book's themes are obvious, and the kids' initial adventures are pretty predictable (looking for water, trying to power their satellite phone), but there's probably enough here to get readers anticipating the next book in the series. Kids may want to look at a picture of an atoll before reading Stranded so they can picture the stranded tweens' island a bit more clearly.","Parents need to know that Stranded is the first book in a series written by the host of TV's Survivor (with Chris Tebbetts, co-author of Middle School: The Worst Years of My Life). In the book, four kids -- two pairs of stepsiblings whose parents just married -- are in a devastating shipwreck and spend much of the book in peril on a deserted island. The stepsiblings will have to depend on their natural abilities, personal knowledge, and, most important, one another to survive. Readers will learn facts about the Pacific Ocean and some survival tips, including how to build a signal fire.

Gone Crazy in Alabama,Harrowing tale of Gaither girls' summer in the South.,"The Gaither sisters are headed down South alongside hundreds of other New York kids for the summer. Leaving their neighborhood, father, and pregnant stepmother behind, Delphine, Vonetta, and Fern spend the summer in Alabama to visit relatives nd find that farm life is far more complicated than it initially appears. Estranged family, sibling rivalry, and a horrible tragedy bring secrets, love, and devotion to life. The biggest question is: Will the girls survive going crazy in Alabama?
","In GONE CRAZY IN ALABAMA, Rita Williams-Garcia does a fantastic job of welcoming readers into the intimate life of the Gaither family. The story has great pacing, at times moving languidly like the slow summers of the South, then switching to breakneck speed when the action demands it. The characters are engaging, fun, and frustrating, just like families in real life.
Kids and families alike will love how well Williams-Garcia portrays the intricacies of family dynamics and the human spirit. No one is all bad or all good, and though family members may not react the way readers expect or want, they are loving and supportive in their own way.","Parents need to know that Rita Williams-Garcia's 2016 Coretta Scott King Author Book Award-winning Gone Crazy in Alabama is a companion book to One Crazy Summer nd P.S.

Some strong themes will be great points for discussion and include sibling rivalry, death in families, and racial injustice. The story takes place on a farm, so there's discussion of eating animals and an instance when a little girl is hurt in a tornado. It's mentioned that a family was killed in a car accident nd that a known Ku Klux Klan member uses the ""N"" word (though the word is never spelled out in the book).

The Eternal Ones,Quirky romantic mystery offers something for every teen.,"Haven Moore is a high school senior in a small Christian Tennessee town. At a very young age she begins to have visions of people and places that she has never seen before. Her grandmother is convinced that she is possessed by demons and spends her days praying for Haven's soul to be healed. Feeling alone and lost in her community, Haven decides to go to New York in quest for Ethan, the boy from her visions. There she meets people from the Ouroboros Society who help her trace her life back to 44 BC. And, if that's not enough plot for you, then there are the three murder mysteries she investigates...
 
","Kristen Miller's imagination is alluring and very entertaining.  She has created likable characters and suspenseful events that keep the reader hooked and excited for more. THE ETERNAL ONES is rich with a mixture of literary genres that will appeal to some, but come across as scatter-brained and confusing to others. Although the theme of chivalric love and a single soul mate for eternity may cause some to roll their eyes, the way in which Miller utilizes mystery, romance, satire, and fantasy offers something for everyone. The open ending invites reader imagination -- and possible sequels.
 ","Parents need to know that this page-turning mystery features three murders -- and the protagonist wonders if she was victim of more than one murder in her various past lives. The book romanticizes love at first sight, and there is talk about sex and desire -- though nothing teen readers will be shocked by.  There are also frequent sexual innuendos that come from Haven's homosexual best friend, Beau. This book explores themes of identity, faith, and the afterlife: Haven is raised to believe that Christianity is the only true faith until circumstances encourage her to explore the possibility of reincarnation. Readers also will get messages about staying true to yourself: Haven is a respectful and independent girl, who, while treated like an outsider, continues to believe in herself.

"""Shouldn't You Be in School?"": All the Wrong Questions, Book 3",Snicket trails an arsonist in compelling installment.,"Snicket and his chaperone are hired to investigate  case of arson, and a suspect is quickly apprehended, but Snicket knows he's innocent. When more fires keep happening, it's obvious that the young man in jail -- the librarian -- couldn't have done them. Snicket is sure Hangfire's behind them -- but why? Meanwhile, the town's children get kidnapped and taken to an academy where they're drugged with laudanum to remain docile and compliant. And Ellington Feint is mixed up in it all. Can he trust her? Can he rely on his loyal associates to save Stain'd-by-the Sea from villainy?
","There’s as much mystery, excitement, wit, and wordplay as ever. That said, Snicket is more contemplative and introspective here and engages in self-doubt, making him an even more complex, relatable hero. He regrets that he can't help his sister in the city (who's just been arrested) and is frustrated that he hasn't been able to find Ellington Feint's father or rid this strange town of fiendish Hangfire. But the loyalty and reliability of his new friends inspire him to push on and not give up. There's no direct confrontation with Hangfire this time, and there are still lots of loose ends to tie up in Book 4, the final installment. But the rich characters and suspenseful plot in Book 3 still add up to a very satisfying and entertaining read.

Free to Fall,Thought-provoking mystery explores free will and technology.,"In the near future, 16-year-old Rory is admitted to an exclusive boarding school for the country's brightest students, virtually assuring her future among the power elite. When she learns that her mother, who died shortly after she was born, also went to Theden Academy but didn't graduate, Rory determines to learn the truth about what happened to her. She soon meets the townie North, who steers clear of social media and doesn't use the decision-making app Lux, which Rory has been relying on to decide everything from which coffee drink to order to whom to ask to the dance. As she and North start to uncover the past, Rory becomes increasingly suspicious of the powerful hold Lux exercises over millions of people, including herself. She starts to understand the importance of being free to make her own choices in life. But if she wants everyone to have the same ability to choose for themselves, she's going to have to bring down a powerful secret society and the biggest tech company in the world.
","With FREE TO FALL, Lauren Miller has created an intriguing mystery that adeptly gets kids thinking about the role technology plays, and should play, in their lives. She uses the classic Milton poem Paradise Lost s a catalyst and key for the heroine to uncover her past and to save us from a mindless future in which not only are we incapable of making decisions for ourselves but also we don't even want to make them. Milton's big ideas are adroitly presented and easy for kids to understand without them being dumbed down.
This is thanks largely to the relatable heroine, Rory, whose believable voice will have kids admiring the academic achievement, logic, and critical thinking that Rory uses to solve problems. She's also emotionally accessible for teens as she struggles with a lot of the same issues of friendship, love, and life choices they face. Refreshingly, it's also a satisfying one-off, without an open ending that creates blatant hopes of future installments. Free to Fall stands every bit as much on its own as Rory does when she's free to decide her own fate.","Parents need to know that Free to Fall's intriguing mystery adventure is wrapped in a package that effectively introduces Milton's Paradise Lost nd will get older tweens and teens thinking about free will, how we exercise it, and how advances in technology affect our decision-making processes. The boarding-school setting ensures a matter-of-fact attitude toward drinking, though the heroine, Rory, 16, doesn't overindulge, and the negative consequences for those who do are shown. The teens use strong language pretty liberally, mostly ""s--t"" and its variations. Rory and boyfriend North kiss quite a few times without a lot of detailed description, although one make-out session is described.

At the beginning of the novel, Joe's mom is briefly missing, and it's discovered that she has been sexually assaulted. Joe begins the summer before high school in a kind of limbo as his family tries to survive what has happened, feeling they can't move forward until they find and punish the attacker. As he navigates the treacherous road to recovery, Joe's surrounded by close family and the friends/partners in crime who always have his back.
","It’s a complex, rewarding book that's part coming-of-age novel and part mystery, wherein every event is affected by the cultural and legal divide between the reservation and the white world outside. Joe's pain and inner struggle are portrayed with sensitivity and realism and with the critical distance that comes with time, as we know he has reached adulthood before telling the story. His mother's attack is agonizing but increasingly meaningful to ""observe"" as all the plot points and issues unfold.

The plot also digs into legal and cultural obstacles Native Americans face. The story is narrated by 13-year-old Joe, whose coming-of-age challenges are magnified by other painful experiences.

Olivia the Spy,Adorable pig learns danger of eavesdropping in cute story.,"In OLIVIA THE SPY, the little pig messes up a couple of things at home: She splatters blueberries on the kitchen wall when she makes a smoothie (after insisting, ""Mommy, I KNOW how to use the blender!"") and throws her red socks in the laundry and turns the family's white shirts pink (after saying, ""Mommy, I KNOW how to work the washing machine!""). Then she overhears her mom on the phone telling Olivia's aunt: ""Oh, I wish there was somewhere I could send her until she develops some SENSE!"" Curious about where she might be sent, Olivia decides to ""investigate"" and starts hiding and listening when her mom's talking to her dad or on the phone. After hearing part of a sentence in which her dad mentions ""an institution,"" Olivia's convinced she'll be sent to prison! It turns out her mom is planning to surprise her by taking her to the ballet, where Olivia has another mishap when she goes through the wrong door and ends up onstage during the dance instead of in the restroom. ","This cute and funny Olivia adventure shows the dangers both of eavesdropping and of presuming you know how to do everything. It's also a cautionary tale for parents who may complain a bit too loudly and often about their kids' behavior and mistakes: The kids are often listening, and a negative rant can make them feel worried and insecure. But all of this is treated in the lightest possible way, with adorable Olivia ""blending in"" (becoming a lamp under a shade, a picture in a frame, part of a zebra rug) to ""spy"" on her parents to see what they're saying bout her.
The art shows Olivia's range of emotions and on one page pictures her alone in a tall prison building topped with barbed wire. But there's a comforting ending with Olivia in bed after the ballet, reading a Julia Child cookbook and offering to make up for spying by cooking for the family the whole next week. When her mom says, ""Oh no you won't!"" Olivia answers in the familiar refrain, ""MOMMY, I KNOW how to COOK!""","Parents need to know that Ian Falconer's Olivia the Spy is another winner in the picture book series starring an adorable pig who often appears in a red-and-white-striped onesie and tends to get into typical kid trouble. This time, after making a few mistakes around the house, she hears her mom complaining about her on the phone and spies on her parents to hear more. Ultimately, she hears a part of a conversation that leads her to believe she's being sent to prison (her mom's actually taking her to the ballet as a surprise). It's a funny misunderstanding cleverly laid out, with a lesson not only for eavesdropping kids but also for complaining parents.

Aerie:  Magonia Book 2,Slightly darker fantasy sequel ramps up the tension.,"AERIE begins a few months after the events in Magonia, with 17-year-old Aza Ray finally living a fairly comfortable, happy life on Earth with her family and boyfriend Jason. But Magonia still calls to Aza, and she knows part of her will always long to return to the sky. When she and Jason suspect that a Magonian has appeared in town, they're afraid she'll go after Aza, or worse still, Aza's loved ones. Jason's fear for Aza's safety leads a secret government agency to capture, imprison and torture Aza in hopes she'll lead them to a secret weapon that could destroy both worlds. In order to save those she loves, Aza will have to leave them behind once again, returning to Magonia to find the secret weapon herself and confront her mother, who's only wants revenge on all the people of Earth.
","This fantasy sequel is more suspenseful nd slightly darker, s heroine Aza faces the challenges of emerging into adulthood -- not to mention saving two worlds while she's at it. Readers who haven't read Magonia may not find Aza and Jason as understandable or easy to root for, but fantasy fans will definitely enjoy the imaginative world above the clouds and the magical creatures to be found there. And teens will definitely relate to Aza's and Jason's struggles toward maturity as they learn to accept themselves and each other as they are, and to have the courage to live their own lives.
Favorite supporting characters return, as do the villainous Zal and Dai, and author Headley ably keeps the pages turning as tension and suspense build to the final confrontation. She also leaves the door open for further adventures in an intriguing new world, and fantasy fans will have a lot to look foward to.","Parents need to know that Aerie is the sequel to the fantasy Magonia, and will probably be more thoroughly understood and appreciated by those who've read the first volume. Violence is in the fantasy world, and though there's little blood and gore, the heroes are frequently in peril from large-scale destruction, fantasy creatures, and a government agency that kidnaps and tortures them. It's mentioned that the older teens have been having sex, that the first time was painful, and that they're being safe and won't have any ""accidental babies."" Some kissing and caressing is briefly described. Strong language includes frequent use of ""s--t"" and ""f--k."" Both Aza and Jason have strong ties to loving and supportive families, and overall messages are positive about living a life of your own choosing, finding balance, and always trying to reach your goals.

"A Thousand Pieces of You: Firebird, Book 1",Time-bending thriller has more romance than mystery.,"Marguerite Caine is the daughter of genius scientists who developed a life-changing invention: the Firebird, which allows people to jump to parallel universes. After Marguerite's beloved father is killed, all clues point to his well-liked young research assistant Paul as the murderer. In hopes of bringing Paul to justice, Marguerite joins Theo (her parents' other graduate assistant) in using the Firebird technology to look for the missing Paul in other universes, such as futuristic London, Imperial Russia, an underwater city, and more. But as Marguerite jumps from universe to universe, the more she gets to know Paul and the less she believes he had something to do with her father's death.
","There's a lot to take in when reading this convoluted yet intriguing tale. There are the multiple universes to keep straight, along with flashbacks, corporate intrigue, and scientific explanations that are clearly fiction but reference schools of thought in physics and philosophy. Despite all of these elements, the mysteries in the plot are ultimately secondary to the primary concern of who Marguerite should love: the socially awkward but gorgeous and brilliant Paul or the charismatic but impetuous and intelligent Theo (never have two physics PhDs been described as so physically attractive; they might as well have been Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans). Insecure about her place as an artist in a family of hard scientists, Marguerite can't see herself as others, particularly the two handsome geniuses, do. It's too bad Marguerite's so full of doubt and needs the guys to validate her, because her original mission to expose her father's murderer is brave and daring. Author Claudia Gray handles the setting changes well, but the book lingers in the Tsarist Russia universe the longest, making some of the other settings seem less important by comparison. The book explores thought-provoking questions about fate, love, and consciousness, but some readers may gloss over all of that to focus, like Marguerite herself, on which boy (and which universe's version of that boy) is her meant-to-be.
 ","Parents need to know that A Thousand Pieces of You is the first in a planned sci-fi series about a form of time traveling in parallel universes. Although there's a central mystery, the novel is mostly propelled by the main character's romantic feelings (there's a convoluted love triangle, and a lengthy passage describing the main character's first -- and second -- time). There's occasional strong language (including ""s--t"" and ""f--k,"" ""a--hole""), and there are several violent interactions -- physical fights and weapons-based skirmishes -- and a couple of notable deaths that deeply affect the protagonist. With its inventive storyline, multiple settings, and romantic overtones, A Thousand Pieces of You should appeal to teens who are fans of speculative fiction love stories.

She escapes on her own, practically washing up at the feet of Prince Levi, neighboring royalty who has also lost friends and relatives to the unseen invaders. Determined to rescue their friends and loved ones, Reyna and crew set sail for dangerous waters.
","Sometimes a book's success comes down to its ending, and this charming maritime fantasy bobbles the climax. Reyna, Blaise, and Levi undergo a series of dangerous and interesting encounters, but when it comes to the final face-off, everything happens too swiftly and easily. Writer Makiia Lucier displays a sure hand with dialogue and action for most of the book, but it would have been better to conclude with more excitement. There will be further adventures, so here's hoping the next volume doesn't disappoint.","Parents need to know that Song of the Abyss is the second volume in a fantasy trilogy by Makiia Lucier. It features a strong female protagonist employed as a Master Explorer. Violent scenes are infrequent and rather tame, although one minor character is beheaded.

"The Adoration of Jenna Fox: The Jenna Fox Chronicles, Book 1",Amnesia's just the half of it for post-coma teen.,"When Jenna Fox wakes up from an 18-month coma, she remembers nothing, and she's in rural California in a broken-down house with her mother and grandmother instead of her home in Boston. All she has is every highlight of her old life on disc -- her life as the perfect daughter that her parents adored so much that deals were made to make sure they wouldn't lose her, even after an accident she wasn't supposed to survive. But once Jenna starts to unravel her parents' secrets, can she live with the decision they've made?
","This sci-fi story definitely gets you thinking. Not only about what kinds of ethical decisions humans will have to deal with in the future (way beyond cloning), but also about what the cost is of not letting go when it's time, both in the regular ""empty nest"" parent sense and the grieving sense. And all of that is wrapped in a taut mystery that Jenna dramatically unravels. Because of what Jenna's father does for a living, readers will be clued into the big secret way before Jenna is, but luckily there are more revelations in store.
Some of the characters in Jenna's new life seem too conveniently placed -- like her friend Allys with artificial limbs who volunteers for the medical ethics board, as well as both a love interest and a neighbor who have big secrets. But within Jenna's family, the tension feels real, and her grandmother is a great mediator between the strict order her parents try to maintain and the fierce need for independence of any 17-year-old. If the author followed today's trends, there would be hundreds more pages dedicated to Jenna's budding romance and her bickering with her mom. So it's refreshing that Pearson sticks to the heart of her story and leaves the rest to readers, whose imaginations will definitely still be reeling for days afterward.","Parents need to know that this sci-fi book includes some kissing between teens and violence that's mostly mentioned in flashback, including an epidemic and natural disaster that kills scores of people and a car accident that kills teens and lands one in a coma. One male student almost attacks the heroine, but help arrives on time.

For the Win,Teen gamers vs. corporations; absorbing but violent sci-fi.,"Mala is a 15-year-old gamer in India, Matthew has become his own boss in China through his gaming skills, and 16-year-old Leonard is facing an intervention in California because his parents believe he is addicted to gaming. They have many things in common even though they have never met: they are all connected through the multiple player online games they love, each of them is brilliant, and each has the idealistic conviction of the young -- that life should be good, and fair. For all. Before they know it, they've been recruited to use their gifts for a greater good. The lines are blurred between real and virtual worlds as gold farmers and factory girls alike are joining the cause, masterminded by the enigmatic Big Sister Nor, hiding somewhere beyond the Internet. Can they make the Industrial Workers of the World Wide Web a reality? The corporate world will do anything to stop them, and Mala, Matthew, and Leonard find themselves and their new friends caught up in a revolution. Murder and intrigue mean that only some of them will survive.
","Fast-paced with brilliant and likable characters from all over the globe, even non-gamers will fall into this idealistic and multilayered tale of a brave new world. Readers who enjoyed Little Brother will enjoy this new geek revolution, if they don't find it overly long. Doctorow has a tendency to speak directly to the reader in brief lectures to explain Ponzi schemes or economic theories, which may annoy many of his readers who undoubtedly already understand such concepts.
But his strong female characters and sympathetic boys like Leonard and Lu make it all worthwhile for anyone who has ever played a multiuser video game and felt the thrill of being one part of a larger whole, or been inspired by the possibilities offered by the new world technology.","Parents need to know that this science-fiction version of a not so distant future contains heavy graphic violence. Children are forced into sweatshops and are recruited and united online, but form real-world armies that attack and fight back, killing as necessary in an exciting quest for social justice. The depictions of contemporary life in the poor parts of China and India may shock teen readers who are not aware that similar poverty exists in this country. Parents could read this book to gain an understanding of the attractions that video gaming has for kids, the friendships built in the online communities, the interdependence and loyalties, and the inherent rewards built into the games that keep them playing. The global appeal and the merger of the virtual and real world experiences that many kids experience also comes to life here.

Here Comes Santa Cat,Cat learns how to make the Nice list in funny holiday tale.,"Cat's afraid he won't get a present because he's on the Naughty list, so he decides to step into Santa's role, red suit and all. But the narrator explains that Santa doesn't give presents to himself, and asks why Cat doesn't just be nice? Cat tries, but ends up caroling badly, giving fish to kid, and toppling a Christmas tree. Then the narrator gives him a gift of two cans of fancy cat food, and Cat gives a needy little cat one of them.""Cat, do you realize what just happened?"" asks the narrator. ""You did something nice!"" Then Santa shows up and gives him a present: an official Santa's Helper (elf) suit, and they ride off together in Santa's sleigh. ","Underwood shows there's more clever fun to be had with the star of the wonderfully original Here Comes the Easter Cat, who speaks directly to the unseen narrator only through signs. In this even more universal story, Cat must conquer his greedy tendencies and learn it's more blessed to give than to receive. And that being nice isn't that hard. Claudia Reuda's spare, expressive drawings in ink and colored pencil on stark white pages show Cat's shifting emotions, hopes, and epiphanies. They look a lot like the quickly changing moods of a little kid, so young readers (and their parents) will have no trouble relating. ","Parents need to know that Here Comes Santa Cat, by Deborah Underwood and illustrated by Claudia Rueda, is another sweet and funny holiday tale from the team that created Here Comes the Easter Cat.

Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe,Literary story of two boys' life-changing friendship.,"At age 15, Ari is a loner who has never had a friend before -- until he meets Dante at the swimming pool. When Dante offers to teach Ari how to swim, the boys discover they make each other laugh, which seems more important than the fact that they have little in common other than that they're both Mexican American and live in El Paso. Dante's love of books and art, as well as his open appreciation of his parents, makes Ari look at his own family differently and inspires him to try to uncover the mystery of his dad, who rarely speaks. Over two summers and the intervening school year, the boys share laughs, secrets, and philosophies. As Aristotle tries to figure out his role in the universe, the importance of Dante's friendship both bothers him and keeps him going -- and, ultimately, changes the course of his life.
","The distinctive first-person voice of Aristotle, both straightforward and poetic, perfectly captures the uncertainties of a teen boy who has long held himself aloof but might want to change that. Ari's frequent melancholy is balanced with a self-deprecating sense of humor and sharp observations, making him sympathetic and likable.
Although there are some exciting scenes, ARISTOTLE AND DANTE DISCOVER THE SECRETS OF THE UNIVERSE focuses more on internal than external action. Because of this, the novel may not be for everyone; the more literary reader, however, will find Aristotle's journey into adulthood and self-acceptance engaging and moving.
 ","Parents need to know that 2013 Printz Honor Book Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe is an introspective coming-of-age story about two Mexican-American boys growing up in El Paso, Texas, in 1987. It brings up questions of identity, particularly in terms of sexuality and sexual orientation. Each boy experiments with kissing a girl; one also does so with a boy. They also try weed nd drink beer. Dante gets jumped by a group of boys, and Ari (short for Aristotle) punches a boy, breaking his nose. And Ari tries out a few curse words to see how his mom reacts. But the book's real focus is friendship and how the perspective and love of a good friend can make you look at yourself differently and motivate you to change for the better.

Jack Plank Tells Tales,An ex-pirate spins captivating yarns.,"Pirate Jack Plank is let go from the only job he's ever known. Left in Jamaica with a small bag of gold coins (so he can get a fresh start), Jack finds shelter in a boarding house, where he befriends owner Mrs. DelFresno, her daughter Nina, and the other boarders. Nina and the other boarders try to help Jack find a new profession, but each time someone suggests a job Jack responds with one of his many high-seas adventure stories.
Jack's pirate stories whisk Mrs. DelFresno, Nina, and the other boarders away to exotic tropical beaches and dark angry seas -- places where magic is possible and danger lurks around every corner.
\ \ Through a process of elimination and careful evaluation of Jack's talents, the group eventually comes up with the perfect job for their highly entertaining friend.
","Award-winning author Natalie Babbitt (Tuck Everlasting) pays tribute to the art of storytelling in this engaging story about Jack Plank, a recently laid-off pirate. Jack's career crisis serves as a framework for eight captivating and highly imaginative pirate stories that are just plain fun to read and tailor-made for group storytelling. And Babbitt's old-fashioned, hand-drawn illustrations match the story's 18th-century setting perfectly.
Because the pirate stories are tame, JACK PLANK TELLS TALES is a great choice for little ones who are interested in pirates but are too young or sensitive for more graphic ""crimes on the high seas"" stories. A mix of mystery, magic, suspense, and surprise, Babbitt's pirate tales veer away from standard fare in their sheer creativity.","Parents need to know that mentions of the pirates' crimes and nasty habits are minimal, and a few scenes show their gentler sides. References to violence are non-graphic and brief, including scenes in which a pirate captain threatens to shoot one of his cowardly crewmen, treasure hunters are found stabbed, and an ancient Egyptian king gets his hand chopped off. In one tale a girl in her early teens gets married, but this fits the 18th-century Caribbean setting. Pirates drink rum and beer.

Big Words for Little People,"Empowering words, spectacular artwork, stupendous concepts.","This creative, energetic group of kids, with their big orange tabby, wiry little dog, and rather patient pet goose, cavort through the pages, demonstrating just how fun, and empowering, it can be to use big words. Verging on the brink of pandemonium, scenes from their life burst with activity as each new word is presented in several lines of rhyming explanation. The final words in the book are not so big in size, but rather in importance -- family, respect, and love -- and they sum up the whole underlying tone of the book.
","Laura Cornell's illustrations are outstanding, extraordinary, stupendous, and superb! Her amazingly detailed watercolor over pen and ink artwork is fascinating, and brings life to every single page. To say she has created a uniquely expressive family is an understatement. Just take a look at the dinner table scene: dressed in crowns and capes and outfits obviously of their own choosing, each kid is doing something other than sitting and quietly eating supper. Milk has been spilt, words are being spelled out in peas, balloons bounce around here and there. Yet the parents are smiling, and the dad even sports a button saying ""Proud Father of BRILLIANCE!!!"" This is a ""celebration.""
While the artwork masterfully sets a tone of acceptance and respect for the individual, the text, which is more an exploration than a story, shows how certain ""big words"" make expressing yourself more fun. Some of the examples are better than others. The pages about ""persistence"" and ""patience"" are much more positive than those that show the pink-faced little sister enduring the embarrassing ""consequence"" of being left in at recess for expoding her bubble gum in class. The attempt to rhyme the lines is uneven, and detracts at times from what is otherwise a very empowering and enjoyable book.","Parents need to know that Big Words for Little People is the eighth book in the Books to Grow By series created by the team of Jamie Lee Curtis and Laura Cornell. All eight deal playfully and respectfully with some aspect of kid behavior. This one considers mostly behavioral kinds of words that kids hear every day but may not understand.

Endling #1: The Last,Fast-paced animal fantasy tackles theme of extinction.,"In ENDLING #1: THE LAST, Byx is an endling, the last of the dairne species, animals who are doglike, but who walk on two legs, talk, and can sense whether someone's lying. After Byx's family and packmates are slaughtered by humans, she's captured by a young female human, Khara, who brings her to an island of scholars in hopes that Byx will be protected. But when they arrive, they find the town planning a ""eumony,"" a funeral for the species, and realize the humans they thought were allies may not be trustworthy. Byx and Khara are joined by two other fantastic animals, a small, chatty, loyal wobbyk, and a fierce feline from the species felivet, whose numbers are also dwindling. Will the friends escape the humans who want to kill them? Are there more dairnes still living on a faraway sentient island, as is rumored? The friends quest to find out as they battle for survival.
","This imaginative animal fantasy, with its detailed world, is action packed and keeps readers turning the page to find out if the narrator's the last of her species or if there’s still hope. Endling #1: The Last uses fantasy to present the threat of extinction, which frees up author Katherine Applegate to call out the guilty species. In this world, humans are treacherous and seldom to be trusted because of their ""endless greed and ambition."" Humans don’t ""understand the balance in life. They do not understand that their will to dominate and control, to use and abuse, is destructive to all."" This verdict is softened somewhat by the character of Khara, a human warrior who joins the band and fights to save Byx.
Not all fantasy authors write with a literary flourish, but Newbery winner Applegate treats readers to thoughtful, beautiful language that arrests attention without stopping the action. The sun's described as ""flushed as a ripe peach."" Khara peers through thick fog that ""had crawled in from the sea, obscuring the world and softening the moon to a fuzzy orb, like the last days of a dandelion."" Despite the blood and gore, or perhaps because of it, and because kids are asked to take the point of view of an animal, readers are prompted to think about the threat of extinction as it looms.","Parents need to know that Endling #1: The Last is the first book in a new trilogy by Katherine Applegate (The One and Only Ivan, Wishtree, the Animorphs science fantasy series). In this book she combines her skill for writing fast-paced fantasy series with her characteristic beautifully wrought prose to craft a story that gets readers chewing on the idea of animal extinction and stewardship of the planet. There's some graphic violence. The main character's entire family and pack gets slaughtered by humans, and characters on both sides of the fight have swords, teeth, and claws, and they're not afraid to use them. Both the protagonist animal and the main human are girl characters who are brave and adventurous.

Wishing to hasten her son's possession of the estate, Aunt Alice sends Katharine to visit her uncle, its current occupant, and have him declared insane. Katharine arrives to find her uncle eccentric but brilliant, a designer of ingenious machines with remarkable capabilities -- and the employer of hundreds of people plucked from the workhouses and given a decent life. Torn between doing her aunt's bidding, which she sees as her only hope for not ending up on the street herself, and her growing fondness for her uncle and the villagers, she also has to contend with mysterious events, people who aren't what they seem, and her attraction to a young man who assists her uncle.
","This book received the Sue Alexander Award for Most Promising New Work from the Society of Children's Book Authors and Illustrators, and the published version lives up to expectations. Plot twists, great characters and conflicts, a strong narrative voice, and a fully realized world of gaslights, steam engines, and 19th century technology bring to life a complex narrative that will delight young girls just getting acquainted with Victorian tales of mystery, manners and romance.

Their mom is captain of the Shadow Comet, a space ship full of privateers that take precious cargo from Earth ships somewhat in the name of the Jovian Union. All three are training to be captain one day, but only one will get the job. The fateful day Tycho gets his first trial commanding the ship, it doesn't go at all smoothly. The captain of the enemy ship claims to have an Earth diplomat onboard -- making the ship off-limits -- but something seems fishy. This diplomat looks and sounds no different from your average scuzzy pirate. Tycho makes the call to commandeer the ship and take it to the dwarf planet Ceres for trial. That's when things get complicated for the Shadow Comet. The trail of one fake diplomat leads to some real pirates -- nasty ones -- who only work for themselves.
","Oh, man, Star Wars fans are going to be all over THE JUPITER PIRATES. (No surprise the author, Jason Fry, wrote Star Wars: The Clone Wars: The Visual Guide.) Three siblings are expert spaceship pilots, two of them solving mysteries in their spare time. Fry builds an intriguing world in his first in the series, gearing kids up for the many space battles to come. The climactic battle in HUNT FOR THE HYDRA is a well-crafted nail-biter. The middle lags a bit -- too many political characters for kids to keep track of -- and some of the transitions are a bit rough, but it'll entertain all the same.

The Heartbreakers,Fun Traveling Pants-style story with fewer mature themes.,"A circle of high school friends find themselves without boyfriends all at the same time. Alexia's parents are therapists, and she's the one who suggests writing a breakup code: a list of rules for the heartbroken to follow that will transform them into the heartbreakers instead. Focusing on themselves for a while instead of their boyfriends leads them to discover or rediscover things they love such as singing in a rock band, photography, and spending time with their girlfriends. But even so, the rules turn out to be too much, and in only a few short weeks there is much more dating going on than there was before, despite the pledge to not date anyone for three whole months.
","This is fun, predictable chick lit about four sophomore girls dealing with guys, parents' divorces, keggers, and the true meaning of friendship. Although the alternating narrator structure becomes a little dizzying with four points of view, the characters are equally drawn, with supportive parents and likable guy characters. Coming up with a code of rules to follow could be a useful tool for many situations. It's just too bad the focus goes right back to boys and dating in the end.","Parents need to know this is a pretty frothy romance somewhat similar to the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants series but with fewer mature topics -- just some teen drinking and a bit of swearing. The girls support each other and exhibit loyalty; most of the guys are positive, well-rounded characters, and the parents are mostly present and supportive of their girls. However, the idea that the girls are more interested in being great friends than having boyfriends isn't how it plays out.

Here in the Real World,"Funny, relatable tale of tweens gardening in the ruins.","It's the start of the summer in Florida. Eleven-year-old Ware's parents are working double shifts all summer so that they can buy their house, and he's looking forward to a quiet time with his grandmother where he can read his books about knights in peace. But HERE IN THE REAL WORLD, things can go awry: His grandmother has a fall and breaks both hips, and Ware's soon back home being forced into a daily program of Meaningful Social Interaction and other normal-kid activities. Just like every year. Only this year, he decides he's had enough, ditches the regimentation, and ducks behind a tree -- where he discovers a girl his age trying to grow papaya plants in the parking lot of a ruined church. Things get interesting fast, and opportunities to practice chivalry crop up frequently.
","Sara Pennypacker's funny, relatable tale of two misfit tweens and their transformative summer on a ruined church property in Florida will resonate with lots of  young readers. Especially those with strong views about how things ought to be who are constantly being told that Here in the Real World things don't work that way. Very little in this tale goes exactly as the characters would wish, but it goes to some profoundly satisfying places and makes some great connections.
""'No, Jolene. We won't let it happen. You won't lose this garden.'
""'What are you talking about?'
""What was he talking about?
""Ware suddenly saw page eleven in his report. Number twelve seemed to be lit up. Thou shalt always be the champion of the Right and the Good, against Injustice.
""That's what he was talking about.
""This was Injustice, all right. He needed to be a champion of the Right and the Good.
""This was, in fact, the purpose that would drive his life, he was suddenly certain.
""He pulled himself up tall. 'I won't let it happen, Jolene. I will save your garden.'
""Jolene snorted. 'How are you going to do that?'
""'I don't know yet. But I will. You won't lose your garden. I pledge.'
""'You pledge?'
""'Promise. I promise.'""","Parents need to know that Here in the Real World is an appealing, insightful middle grade tale of two quirky, relatable 11-year-olds, written by Sara Pennypacker (Pax). It's a summer of discovery (self- and otherwise) as bookish Ware meets determined, scrappy Jolene in the parking lot of a ruined church. Knightly ideals meet real-life troubles, and Ware is fascinated with the idea of baptism and how it might turn him into a kid his go-getter parents would actually understand. As the story unfolds, we learn a lot about chivalry, history, migrating birds, ecosystems, gardening -- and fine points of grammar. There's some trauma and tragedy involved -- the tween who was abandoned by her mom at 5 now lives with a hard-drinking aunt, and scrounges to keep them alive. Tweens occasionally say ""crap"" and obsess over the uses ancient civilizations found for urine. There are strong messages of friendship, kindness, empathy, teamwork, being who you are, and accepting others as they are.

Me and Marvin Gardens,"Sensitive boy vs. subdivision, bullies in coming-of-age gem.","ME AND MARVIN GARDENS is narrated by 11-year-old Obe, who lives in an old house next to a new subdivision development built on land that used to belong to his family. Before the suburb filled up with new kids, Obe and his best friend Tommy wandered the cornfields and played in the creek. But now Tommy's taken up with a new crowd of insensitive, bullying boys. Obe's an environmentally conscious kid, always picking up litter, so he's fascinated when he spots a fantastic hybrid animal who eats the plastic refuse discarded all over the new development, but whose own waste may be toxic. He names the animal Marvin Gardens after the property in the Monopoly board game, an irony not lost on him. When the other boys find out about Marvin, and the adults accuse Obe of vandalism, Obe must hide and protect his animal friend while navigating shifting social pressures with his peers.
","This story about a boy and his (not quite) dog has an unusual fantasy element, is environmentally themed, and is narrated with pinpoint emotional honesty by a refreshingly thoughtful, sensitive boy. Just like the odd hybrid animal portrayed, Me and Marvin Gardens is an unusual mix, a contemporary coming-of-age story with a dash of the fantastic, all confidently handled by author Amy Sarig King. Obe's an eminently likeable narrator with an irresistible kid voice that carries the reader easily along. And though he’s on the ""right"" side of every hot topic issue -- conservation, sexual consent -- other characters argue different points of view, thus encouraging readers to think critically and enter into debate.
King finds fictional ways to weave larger facts about the environment into the story, and make connections to American history. She's said that this book was a labor of love, giving her a chance to express feelings she herself had growing up in a rural area bulldozed into a suburb, and her connection's evident, making this gem truly shine.","Parents need to know that Me and Marvin Gardens is by Amy Sarig King, who's already made a name for herself in young adult literature as A.S. King (Ask the Passengers) and here moves smoothly into middle grade. This sensitive and thoughtful book is narrated by Obe, an 11-year-old boy who lives in rural Pennsylvania as it transitions to suburban development. The tracts of land being developed were once a farm owned by his family, and Obe mourns the loss of his beloved cornfields. King skillfully weaves in larger and thought-provoking environmental themes and also touches on sexual consent with some bullying boys and a quick middle school kiss. Though this book has a fantastical element, its true strength lies in the absolute authenticity of Obe's voice and perceptions as he navigates a disappointing friendship and stays true to his core values.

"Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile",The ever-ingratiating Lyle charms again.,"Sometimes, you can try too hard to be liked. Mr. Grumps and his cat don't like Lyle. When Lyle and Mr. Valenti, his old performing partner, do an impromptu show in Mr. Grumps's department store, Mr. Grumps has Lyle put in the zoo, but he escapes in time to save Mr. Grumps from a fire. The ever-ingratiating Lyle charms again.
 ","The illustrations are at the peak of Waber's detailed and distinctive style, more sophisticated than in The House on East 88th Street, as is the fun-to-read text. Lots of patterns, watercolor highlights, and expressive faces, as well as detailed building interiors, create a world of imagination and believability with simple bold lines and colors. Although some readers may wish Mr. Grumps got some comeuppance for his curmudgeonly ways, Waber's own gentle nature keeps him from vengeful themes: In the end goodwill and courage win out, and our crocodilian hero is restored to his family and is once again loved by everyone. However, given Mr. Grumps's determined hostility, Waber is forced to resort to that old chestnut of plot construction -- the timely lifesaving act that turns enemies into friends. Parents may wish Lyle could solve his problem in a way more accessible to real children, but by then the story is verging on melodrama, so the dramatic resolution is perhaps inevitable.","Parents need to know that kids love the simple felt-tip cartoon illustrations.

Dreamwood,Fearless heroine tackles a deliciously creepy forest quest.,"Lucy can't wait to see her father, so she ditches her boring boarding school in San Francisco and takes the train north to where he's busy doing his work as a ghost catcher. When she arrives at the station of a small and somewhat rough logging town, he's not only not there to greet her, no one's seen him for weeks. In his last letter he claimed to be on to something big, and the notes he left behind claim it had to do with a strange disease affecting the trees, a disease some of the townspeople want to blame him for. She figures out he's gone to an abandoned and possibly cursed forest called the Devil's Thumb, a place where her father thinks the disease began. She's determined to find him on her own until a local boy named Pete, whose parents are ruined by the lumber crisis, convinces her she needs help as much as he needs money to save his family. Apparently the cursed forest used to be covered in trees called Dreamwood that have magic and healing properties. If there's only one Dreamwood tree left, it could make them rich and save the forests. But something -- a force -- is in that wood and very protective of everything in it. They're warned not to take anything unless it is freely given. Lucy wonders how her father could survive there so long. What if they're too late to save her father and the last Dreamwood in the forest?
","DREAMWOOD has everything going for it. Lucy, the heroine, is pretty awesome. Not many girls escaping finishing schools know how to hunt ghosts and do it fearlessly. Debut author Heather Mackey has a gift for creating compelling characters, right down to the oddballs in the small logging town. She also creates a fantastic world that grounds us in a little reality -- it feels like the early 20th century of the Pacific Northwest -- but has enough twists on the theme to keep readers guessing -- such as sea serpents as well as First Peoples who live more in harmony with the settlers than Native Americans did but also re to blame for the danger that lies in the woods.
The woods of Devil's Thumb are deliciously creepy. By the time readers get to that part of the adventure, there's no putting the book down. The story moves fast, twists and turns like a gnarled old tree, and stays complex and scary. It's quite a feat for a first-time novelist. ","Parents need to know that Dreamwood is an excellent debut fantasy book for middle grade readers and teens, but it's maybe not the best choice for a camping trip if ghost stories are not your child's thing. There's a malevolent force in the woods that 12-year-old Lucy and her young teen friend Pete face. At one point the trees -- which may indeed be carnivorous -- make them hallucinate faces on the trunks that are ready to eat them. People around them get killed in the woods -- by large animals, sentient trees, and flash floods -- and they discover piles of bones on the site of a mass killing from years before and a slew of angry ghosts. Lucy's out looking for her father, who was lost in those scary woods weeks before. She's just about the perfect strong girl character: determined, brave, smart, confident, and independent.

The Accidental Highwayman,Bandits and faeries mix in rollicking fantasy series debut.,"THE ACCIDENTAL HIGHWAYMAN is the tale of Kit Bristol, an 18th-century English orphan who gets into assorted troubles. He's spent much of his youth as a trick rider in the circus of the man who bought him from the workhouse, then becomes the servant of an impoverished nobleman who wins him in a card game. Soon, he makes the unwelcome discovery that his master is actually the gentlemanly highwayman Whistling Jack -- and is forced to assume the bandit's identity when the man unexpectedly dies. Before too long, he's sent on a mission to rescue a kidnapped faery who's being forced into an unwelcome marriage. It's love at first sight, but the path of true love never runs smooth. In this case, the hapless Kit must contend with two warring armies of magical beings and most of British law enforcement, hell-bent on ridding the roads of robbers, along with all the complications of first (and star-crossed) love. ","Tripp's 18th-century narrative style may be a barrier to action-oriented or younger kids, but Kit's lively, self-deprecating style and the illustrations and constant ups and downs will appeal. The horse Midnight and the French bulldog Demon will draw fans of their own. The conclusion averts some immediate problems but sets the stage for many more.","Parents need to know that The Accidental Highwayman is the first installment in a new young-adult series by Ben Tripp, previously known for adult zombie fiction. He takes on the tale and the voice of 16-year-old 18th-century orphan Kit Bristol and, as the title says, ""his horse Midnight, a Mysterious Princess, and Sundry Magical Persons Besides"" -- a crowd-pleasing mix. There are battle scenes in which characters die, and Kit himself is under constant threat of being arrested and hanged. That -- and the moral ambiguity of gentleman bandits -- aside, there's little problematic material here. Kit is sent on  mission to rescue a kidnapped faery, and the two fall in love, but they never kiss, because kissing is a fateful matter in faery culture.

Brave Face:  A Memoir,"Gripping look at boy's struggle with depression, coming out.","In BRAVE FACE: A MEMOIR, author Shaun David Hutchinson looks back on his struggles as a teen with depression and with accepting himself as a gay man. Hutchinson didn't want to be like the stereotypical gay men he'd seen and heard talked about all his life, and couldn't even if he did. That just wasn't him. Plus, laws and policies enacted by his government reinforced the idea that gay people were best hidden away, doomed to a depraved lifestyle and early death from AIDS. That's more than enough for anyone to struggle with, but Hutchinson also had a mind that kept showing him that he would never fit in because he was ugly nd didn't deserve to love or be loved by anyone. Suicide became the most logical course. It was an ending, but what he couldn't know then was that it was also a beginning.
","This honest, eye-opening, and moving memoir is for anyone who is or loves someone who doesn't fit in, doesn't feel loved, isn't sure who they are, needs help, wants to help; in short, anyone. Brave Face: A Memoir tells one particular teen's story in a frank, no-holds-barred way that deftly balances the way he sees things now, 20 years later, with the only way he was capable of seeing things in the moment, as things happened. Readers who are trying to cope with the same or similar problems will find an oasis of understanding here and be encouraged to envision a future where they belong. Readers who are having an easier time will still find a lot that's easy to relate to. They'll get a profound understanding of what depression is and does, as well as what's it's like when you don't like, and are even pretty scared of, what you think you're becoming.
A lot of the issues Hutchinson deals with are difficult to think and talk about, let alone experience. But it's a good chance to try to start talking about how we see ourselves, what we think the future holds, what our value is as human beings, what we hope for, what our inner voice tells us, when we're OK, and when we need help. Ultimately the messages are hopeful: that it's OK to hurt, it's OK to ask for help, and that although it doesn't happen quickly or easily, it does get better. Strong language, frank sexuality, and difficult themes of self-harm and suicide make it best for teens and up.","Parents need to know that Brave Face: A Memoir is YA author Shaun David Hutchinson's frank look back on his struggles with coming out as gay and with depression during his teen years. It includes a harrowing and detailed description of his attempted suicide, and honest descriptions of self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and a sexual assault. Some things are difficult to read, but none of it is glorified; it's meant to help people with similar struggles see that it's OK to ask for help, and to know that although it does get better, getting better takes a long time, a lot of work, and that the road to recovery isn't a straight line. The introduction offers a content warning and resources, websites, and phone numbers for help with depression, suicide, coming out, and more. There are descriptions of both same-sex and opposite-sex kissing and making out. Having sex isn't directly narrated, but body parts, positions, and specific acts are mentioned. Besides frank words for body parts like ""d--k,"" other strong language includes ""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""fag,"" ""faggot,"" and ""homo."" Brave Face teaches readers a lot about how depression works on your mind and why positive representations that avoid stereotypes are so important in mainstream media. It'll inspire a lot of empathy for people who are hurting because they feel like they can't be themselves, like they're worthless, and like no one understands them or what they're going through.

The more she learns about the town and the mysteries of her house, the more she learns about herself. Unfortunately, the house's past threatens to take control of her in ways she never imagined.
","This is a great novel full of excitement and intrigue. Authors Marilyn Nelson (a Newberry Honor recipient) and Tonya C. Hegamin weave a tale that takes the reader back and forth through time with the greatest of ease. They are adept at creating characters that readers care about. Pemba alternates between being fiesty and sullen as she tries to adjust to a new life and town while worrying about friends back home leaving her behind. Phyllys has a quiet determination and dignity juxtaposed with intense sadness. Both teens feel the resentment that comes from living life under someone else's control, yet both are resolute in their pursuit of justice for crimes committed long ago.

"The Last Star: The 5th Wave, Book 3","Intense finale to alien-invasion saga is violent, upsetting.","THE LAST STAR continues where The Infinite Sea left off, with Ringer, now with enhanced capabilities, trying to run away from Col. Vosch, while Ben, Cassie, Sam, and Evan try to figure out how to stay alive -- and stop the fifth wave from finishing off what's left of humankind. Vosch lets Ringer go with an ""Other"" chaperone and a command to kill Evan Walker in exchange for her ""freedom"" (and that of Ben nd the rest of the remaining crew). After Vosch reveals a devastating secret bout the origins of the sleeper Silencers, Ringer meets back up with what remains of her old company. As Ringer decides whether she can kill Evan, who has so openly shown his ability to rebel against his programming by falling in love, Cassie decides she will once again step up to protect her little brother, her love, and what's left of humanity.
","Compelling but at times unnecessarily convoluted, this final installment will keep you reading but will occasionally distress more than it satisfies. Cassie, in particular, is especially infuriating through most of it. Three books in, and Cassie is still immaturely obsessed with whether her feelings for Evan are love, despite how obvious it might seem to every human and nonhuman alike. Realistic for a teen character but frustrating for a reader, Cassie's behavior is the most confused it has ever been, inconsistent and almost regressive for most of the story. Meanwhile, Evan is ever steadfast in his love for ""Mayfly,"" his desire to make amends for his past as a Silencer, and his commitment to do anything and everything possible to protect not only Cassie and Sam but everyone. Author Yancey sets up both couples -- Evan and Cassie and Zombie and Ringer -- as mirrors and foils. Each romance has a brave, impetuous teen fighting unimaginable odds. Ringer is fascinatingly cool and calm, even dealing with personal crises and changes of heart. She's all things Cassie isn't, and yet they must work together to rescue the men -- and the world -- they love. Unfortunately, some of the plot developments are underwhelming and anticlimactic. After years of readers waiting for the unveiling of the aliens, the resolution is disappointing. Despite the missteps, readers will zip through this final book and want to know what happens. Ultimately, courage and love reign supreme in this story, regardless of the sadness and grief everyone experiences.","Parents need to know that The Last Star is the third and final installment in the 5th Wave sci-fi trilogy by bestselling author Rick Yancey.

The Coldest Girl in Coldtown,"Dark, violent, sensuous vampire tale best for older teens.","While humanity tries to stop the epidemic by putting all vampires under quarantine in ""coldtowns,"" teens attracted to everything sexy-scary voluntarily go into them, knowing they'll never come out and hoping to be turned into vampires. When Tana Bach, 17, is bitten, she knows that the only way she'll keep her family safe from the monster she'll become is by riding out the infection in Coldtown. On the way, she rescues Gavriel, a charismatic vampire with a mysterious past, and starts falling for him. Tana needs to find a way to protect herself and her loved ones before Gavriel's past catches up to them both and before she goes cold forever.
","Holly Black does a good job conveying both the teen attraction to the dark side and the genuine horrors it contains. The writing is good, better than that benchmark of vampire stories, Twilight. The prose is edgier and darker, better suited to older teens. Heroine Tana's strong, independent voice is realistic, and a couple of horrific passages border on poetic. Breaks in the action to provide backstory are sometimes disjointed, but most of the story clips along at a good pace. It's a solid entry in the vampire-horror genre that mature fans will enjoy.","Parents need to know that The Coldest Girl in Coldtown is a vampire book by Holly Black, author of Doll Bones and co-author of The Spiderwick Chronicles, that immediately plunges the reader into a violent and bloody post-vampire-apocalypse world. Glorified vampire gore and lore have permeated pop culture and social media. Vampire hunters have hit reality TV shows; popular blogs show video feeds of nonstop, rave-style vampire balls in the quarantine area known as Coldtown; and gift-shop baby tees say things like Corpsebait. Kids want to be vampires and install shunts in their veins to provide easy access to their blood. Main character Tana, 17, is to Twilight's Bella as Joan Jett is to Doris Day. One helpful character in Coldtown is transgender. Graphic and detailed descriptions of violence abound, not only of the traditional blood sucking but also of beheading, stabbing, shooting, torture, and vampires committing suicide by burning in the sun. All this, plus sensual and erotic descriptions of biting, being bitten, watching someone else being bitten, and deep, detailed, bloody-tongue kisses, make this a vampire book for the more mature teen.

"Alexander Hamilton: The Making of America, Book 1","Succinct, kid-friendly bio of America's trendiest founder.","ALEXANDER HAMILTON: THE MAKING OF AMERICA is a brief but surprisingly in-depth biography for middle-grade readers by author Teri Kanefield. It traces Hamilton's journey from being a humble West Indian raised without a father to being General Washington's aide-de camp and trusted advisor, to his successes and failures in the sphere of politics and the drafting of the Constitution and the Federalist Papers, to his foundational role in the creation of the United States Treasury and the first national bank. Kanefield highlights the once-polarizing figure's enduring legacy and impressive foresight into the trajectory of American history. Self-conscious of his humble origins, fiercely opposed by jealous rivals, and intellectually superior to all challengers, Hamilton's tragically brief but remarkable life and career are the embodiment of the American dream as envisioned by the Founding Fathers, the esteemed pantheon of which he is certainly a member.
","Informative and exciting, this dynamic story flies by in a flash, much like the titular hero. The writing in Alexander Hamilton: The Making of America is uniformly strong, peppered with solid sections of historical context, suitable introductions to basic political theories, and bits and pieces of quotes from primary sources. While the biography seems well-researched and provides citations in the endnotes, it would be nice if writers of history for younger readers weren't so shy about showing the work that went into reconstructing the record. Seeing the origins and details of where historical conclusions are drawn from is what makes the evidence reliable and relatable. That being said, the book dovetails nicely with the way American history is taught in elementary and middle school, and Alexander Hamilton is one of the most important actors in that drama.","Parents need to know that Alexander Hamilton: The Making of America is a sweeping, informative, yet digestible introduction to the life and times of one of the most influential figures in the story of the early United States. The biography serves as an excellent supplement for middle schoolers learning about American history and government or for anyone who fell in love with Hamilton on Broadway (or just the cast lbum) and wants a more straightforward presentation of the material. Nicely illustrated with black-and-white images of etchings, portraits, paintings, and historical documents.

"I Am Number Four: Lorien Legacies, Book 1",Super-powered fugitive alien finds high school romance.,"The story of a cute alien finding both love and his superpowers while on the run from not-so-cute aliens -- that's probably the tagline that sold the movie rights. Here are a few more details: John is one of 18 to leave the planet Lorien before the evil Mogadorians completely destroyed it. The survivors made it to Earth and spilt up -- nine kids with nine mentors who must stay on the run from Mogadorians on Earth who want to finish the job. Thanks to a charm, each kid has a number and can only be destroyed in order. Three are dead as Number Four heads to Paradise, Ohio with his mentor Henri, who is waiting for John to develop his superpowers so he can begin to train him. Henri is thrilled when John's hands start to mysteriously glow, but John's training gets in the way of his romance with Sarah and friendship with Sam, who has an odd fascination with aliens already. Then, one of Sam's conspiracy newsletters -- printed only hours away -- mentions the Mogadorians. Are the evil aliens already hot on their trail?
","Though the mish-mash of genres keeps I AM NUMBER FOUR from any real complexity, the various elements seem to blend together quite well. Only at the end, as expected, do readers get the all-out alien slug-fest.
John is a solid, good-hearted character, and his relationship with his mentor Henri is touching. Love interest Sarah seems to lose her depth as the story goes forward -- maybe it's the too-quick acceptance of who John really is that does it. But other teen characters grow in surprising ways. And there are just enough surprises and suspense to propel readers through the series -- and into theaters to see the film.","Parents need to know that I Am Number Four is the *first book in the Lorien Legacies series. This aliens-on-Earth sci-fi tale focuses as much on high school social life as it does on one good teen alien's fight for survival. On the high school front there's some bullying, a fistfight, some drinking, and a house fire started by teen drinkers. When the alien-on-alien action comes to a head there are some intense battle sequences with big monsters, bloody injuries, limbs severed, death, and destruction. As John, or Number Four, begins to develop his superpowers and realizes the importance of them, he has a great mentor in Henri and friends he learns to trust.

"Pickles to Pittsburgh: Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, Book 2",Winning illustrations but short on plot.,"Tasty things can happen in your dreams, and some of them can be downright delicious -- just ask Kate! In a dream, she and Henry fly to the land of Chewandswallow, where broccoli is as big as trees and it rains popcorn. She gets the idea to transport the giant food from a town that has too much to places that have too little.
Kate also finds that being awake can be just as appetizing -- especially with the return of a travel-weary relative!
 ","Fortunately for a book that relies so strongly on visuals, the comic book-like drawings are full of action and detail. Another nice touch is that the pages illustrating Kate's dream are done in full color, while those depicting her awake state are in black-and-white. There's so much going on in the illustrations that young readers can forgive -- or forget -- the lack of action in the story line itself.
In dreams, all things are possible. That's the lesson Kate learns in PICKLES TO PITTSBURGH, a book that brings together the themes of world community, wanderlust, and watercress sandwiches. Unfortunately, the actual plot of the book isn't as filling. Most of the action takes place in Kate's dream.","Parents need to know that Pickles to Pittsburgh is the second book in the Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs series. The comic-strip illustrations are clear winners with the kids, holding their interest through thin slices of plot. Here images of crazy giant food mixes with the rather serious topic of world hunger, all in sister Kate's wild dream.

Madeline and the Bad Hat,"A little heavy-handed, but still a charming book.","The Spanish ambassador moves in next door, and Madeline soon discovers that Pepito, his son, is a bad boy. Gradually, Pepito's pranks escalate, but despite the intensity of his teasing behavior, Pepito eventually learns his lesson. Ludwig Bemelmans's illustrations of Paris life, particularly a market scene, are as charming as ever.
 ","To make the point that Pepito is a bad hat, Bemelmans goes overboard, progressing from standard mischief to downright cruelty. The most offensive verse revolves around Pepito's creation: a guillotine. Pepito, the author writes, ""was unmoved by the last look / the frightened chickens gave the cook.""
Despite the intensity of Pepito's bad behavior, the message is clear: He has to change if he wants Madeline and the other girls to play with him. Children will recognize all of Pepito's attempts to make friends, including showing off, and the illustration of the changed Pepito and the girls setting free birds, butterflies, and other animals is heartwarming.","Parents need to know that this lesson in decent behavior may not entertain young readers. But the art is rich with detail and excitement, and the verse is witty.

Blueberry Girl,"Enchanting poem, magical artwork...a touching gift of hope.","With all of nature looking on, and a wise owl hovering protectively overhead and following along, page after page offers wishes for a young girl, the blueberry girl, as she grows. Slight reference is made to fairy godmother wishes, both good and bad, but most are hopes and dreams for adventure, true friends, wisdom, truth, and joy.
","Thought-provoking and enchanting words of hope flow through almost magical illustrations, creating a poem that prays for a life of wonder and truth for the girl. She is called the ""blueberry girl"" though no one every really explains why. This might be a problem if it did not add to the fairytale quality of the book. The poem is best read aloud, as most poetry is, and offers the kind of uplifting message that makes the book a perfect one for new mothers or graduating girls.
 Artwork full of colorful spirits, watchful animals, large blue whales, and tiny fairies sleeping in flowers amid vining branches creates a dreamy, magical community of nurturing support. Together, the text and artwork flicker here and there with subtle reminders of older fairytales; however, the message, told through the simple, hopeful prayer, is thoroughly modern.","Parents need to know that this book offers prayers and wishes for a growing girl, the blueberry girl. It contains nothing harmful or inappropriate, but may be too abstract for young kids. It would be a good gift for a new parent, especially if the baby is a girl, or for a girl moving on to new adventures in life.

"Listen, Slowly",Captivating tale of U.S. girl meeting her family in Vietnam.,"Twelve-year-old Mia has been looking forward to a summer spent swimming and sunning in her hometown of Laguna Beach, California. But her plans are ruined when her parents insist she accompany her grandmother Ba on a trip to Vietnam to follow a dubious detective's tip about Mia's grandfather Ong, who disappeared during the Vietnam War. Mia resents giving up her summer to travel to a hot, crowded country she has no allegiance to, and she doesn't care to meet the dozens of distant family members who swarm upon their arrival. As summer drifts by and she reluctantly adjusts to the culture shock and language barrier, the mystery behind Ong's final days begins to reveal itself as Mia embarks on a journey of self-discovery.
","LISTEN, SLOWLY is a captivating read from start to finish, with well-drawn characters and colorful descriptions of Vietnam that vividly come live through the eyes of an impressionable young Mia. Author Thanhha Lai does a remarkable job capturing the adolescent discontent of a California girl who finds herself in a land completely different from the one she knows, and she seamlessly stitches what ultimately becomes a poignant tale of self-discovery into the richly woven narrative. Mia is a complex and entertaining narrator, and the myriad friends and family members that shape her journey are funny and memorable. Despite some of the silly and sticky predicaments Mia gets herself into, including an episode involving thong underwear and a manipulative ploy to disrupt the detective working to find Ong, at the heart of Mia's journey is the deep and lasting understanding she comes to about family, friendship, and herself. ","Parents need to know that Listen, Slowly is the second novel by Thanhha Lai, who won the 2011 National Book Award for Young People's Literature and a Newbery Honor for Inside Out & Back Again. It's told from the point of view of Mia, a 12-year-old Vietnamese American girl whose summer plans at home in Laguna Beach, California, re ruined when her parents force her to accompany her grandmother on a trip to Vietnam. As Mia begrudgingly adjusts to culture shock and gets to know her eclectic extended family, she comes to appreciate her cultural heritage. Listen, Slowly dives into some heavy subject matter about the Vietnam War, including haunting descriptions of a bombing and conditions endured by a prisoner of war. But it's Mia's coming-of-age journey, driven by positive messages about family, friendship, love, and sacrifice, that will really resonate with readers. There isn't much in the way of inappropriate content, but there are some mildly sexually suggestive scenes with older teens and some silly talk about ""boobs"" and thongs. There's an Audible Audiobook version narrated by Lulu Lam, published by HarperAudio.

Reached,"Satisfying, solid resolution of twisting dystopian romance.","In REACHED, the final book in the Matched trilogy, the Rising against the controlling Society begins with a spreading Plague. By providing a cure, the Rising starts to win over the people. But the three protagonists -- Cassia; her friend and Society-approved Match, Xander; and her love, Ky -- struggle to reconcile their personal hopes with the drama playing out around them. Who really brought the Plague, and why? Can the Rising and its leader, the Pilot, be trusted? Their alliances -- to their families, the Rising, and to each other -- are tested. As the Plague mutates and spreads, Ky goes still; Xander searches for a new cure; and Cassia helps unleash latent creative voices and puts her sorting skills to work helping Xander.
","The pace picks up here, with threads of a medical thriller entwined in the engaging tale of rebellion, love, and longing. But it's the quieter thoughts that stick: Cassia's meditation on the purpose of creating, the ways the symbolic power of a poem can shift and change, the choices and challenges that complicate the desire to do good, and what makes a life well lived.
 Matched was told from Cassia's perspective, and the second book, Crossed, shifted between Cassia and Ky. Reached adds a third narrative voice: that of Xander, whose absence was keenly felt in the middle book. At first he sounds confident but naive; his evolution from earnest soldier into a bruised but wiser young man is one of the more interesting narrative threads. ","Parents need to know that the plot of Reached centers on efforts to control a mutating virus. Victims become ""still,"" in a coma-like state, and many die, sometimes in a rather grisly fashion. But the focus is on moral and philosophical questions: the chance of doing wrong even when you're trying to do right, the quandary of whether the end justifies the means, and the risks and rewards of love and faith.

Year of the Jungle,Moving yet upbeat story of girl with dad away at war.,"Little Suzy knows her dad \""has to go to something called a war. It's in a place called Viet Nam.... He will be gone a year. How long is a year?\"" She finds out it's very long when he misses holidays, birthdays, and her first communion. Someone says her dad will be in a jungle, so she pictures him playing with an elephant and an ape. But then she accidentally catches a TV news report about Viet Nam and sees \""Explosions. Helicopters. Guns. Soldiers lie on the ground. Some of them aren't moving.\"" Her mom quickly turns it off, and Suzy doesn't say anything. \""Later I hide in the closet and cry,\"" she recalls. These candid recollections of fear and confusion are based on author Suzanne Collins' own childhood, when her father was deployed to Vietnam in 1968.
","YEAR OF THE JUNGLE is a moving, personal account of how it feels to have a parent off at war when you're too young to understand what war means or how long a year is. Little Suzy is confused and misses her dad terribly, delighting in his postcards and praying for his return, and using her imagination to picture him in the jungle. She's also a regular, smiley kid with a cat, two older siblings, and a friend she draws with. Collins deftly balances the fear and freakout of a little girl who learns her dad's in danger with the upbeat, optimistic portrayal of a kid going about the business of being a kid. James Poimos' cartoony illustrations are more reassuring and funny than scary. But there's one imagined war scene (with images of guns, tanks, airplanes, explosions), and he clearly expresses Suzy's fear and worry when her eyes get very big, in one case filling nearly the whole page. ","Parents need to know that Year of the Jungle is Hunger Games author Suzanne Collins' autobiographical picture book that recalls how she felt as a little girl in 1968, when her dad was a soldier off fighting the Vietnam War. James Proimos' cartoony illustrations help keep the tone light and upbeat, but there's one page that depicts an imagined war scene (guns, tanks, airplanes, explosions), and little Suzy's fear and concern show when her big round eyes get very, very big. Her dad does come home uninjured, but she remarks in her narration, ""He stares into space. He is here but not here. He is back in the jungle."" The book offers a moving, kid's-eye view of how war can affect military families. Adults have a strong role to play in how kids understand war and their families' participation in it; the Sesame Street/USO project for Military Families is one resource you might want to check out.

They've been taken in by Jack Piper, who's the top advisor to the king, and his five children. The vastness of life on the ground is unsettling to the group whose whole world is a small island-city, and the people on the ground enjoy levels of personal freedom those on Internment could only imagine. But this new kingdom is not without its own horrors, and it's proving too much for Morgan's best friend, Pen. Morgan becomes convinced that to save Pen they'll have to get back to Internment somehow. But the only way to make returning even remotely possible would be Morgan betraying a secret that Pen discovered about the two kingdoms. What will Morgan do to save the ones she loves?
","Lauren DeStefano's eloquent prose perfectly captures the on-the-brink feeling of power and possibility, of being ""young and bright and waiting to see what we are capable of."" Without pandering to teens, she creates a believable, relatable narrator; questions about where we feel at home, how to love each other, how to protect each other, even how to be mad at each other, and where to place our faith are explored with a fine, deft touch and a lyrical ear for language.
The new world in which the group finds itself is as vividly realized as Internment was in Perfect Ruin and provides a lot of food for thought, especially in contrast to Internment. The story never veers offtrack but builds tension steadily to an ending that, now that we're so invested in the characters, will have us continuing to think long after finishing nd eagerly anticipating the next installment.","Parents need to know that Burning Kingdoms is the second in Lauren DeStefano's Internment Chronicles series.

But it's a society at war, and bombings cause mass destruction and casualties.

Children will laugh at the ensuing chaos when the princess feels the need to go while she's playing at the top of the castle.

Callie is laser-focused on becoming captain of the dance team next year by leading the team to the national championships this year. Millie wants to attend a summer seminar in broadcast journalism at teh University of Texas, Austin, but she can't find a way to tell her mom that she doesn't want to go back to fat camp this year. After taking part in a vengeful act of vandalism, Callie is forced to work with Millie as part of her punishment. Can Millie show Callie that there's such a thing as real friendship?
","Author Julie Murphy takes her fans back to familiar territory with this friendship tale that doesn't quite have the same spark or fresh attitude as the book that inspired it. Readers who come to Puddin' because they fell in love with Willowdean in Dumplin' may be disappointed that she's relegated to the sidelines here. Unfortunately, neither Millie nor Callie are funny or engaging enough to take Willowdean's torch and run with it.
That being said, there are still enough positive messages, good role models, friendship drama, relationship drama, romance, and slumber parties to make it an enjoyable read for teens looking for a light, good-hearted read. Teens who relate to Callie's intensity will enjoy her journey to becoming a better person and a good friend. Those who struggle to accept themselves for who they are, and their bodies for what they are, will root for Millie as she learns when not to take ""no"" for an answer.","Parents need to know that Puddin' is a companion novel to the popular Dumplin' by Julie Murphy.

Profanity isn't frequent but includes ""s--t,"" ""f--ked,"" ""d--k,"" ""bitches,"" and more.

Legacy and the Queen,Tennis and magic mix in solid fantasy series start.,"LEGACY AND THE QUEEN is the story of 12-year-old Legacy, who lives in the provinces with her father where she helps him run an orphanage. Times are hard, and money is tight; there are many days when Legacy never stops feeling hungry, but she works hard to help provide for the little ones. But tennis is her real passion, and every morning she's up before dawn hitting shots against a stone wall for the sheer love of it. When she learns about a tennis tournament in the big city, she's determined to go, and to win. Because if she does win, she'll make enough money to keep the orphanage going for years. But not everyone at the palace's tennis academy, where Legacy wins a coveted training spot, is happy to see this outsider who poses such a big threat to the established players. To make it to the tournament final and win, Legacy will have to tame a fire-breathing, winged horse, unravel the mysteries and magic of stringing a tennis racket, and find out who keeps sabotaging her at every turn.
","This fantasy series created by Kobe Bryant is off to a pretty solid start as it intriguingly mixes fantasy, magic, dystopia, and tennis with a strong, determined heroine. Author Annie Matthew does very well at creating a world that's easy to picture in your mind while keeping the story of Legacy and the Queen moving right along. Big kids and tweens will admire Legacy's determination and relate to her struggles to understand and manage some strong emotions. More experienced readers will see some of the plot twists coming, or at least suspect what's likely to happen, but not so much that they won't enjoy immersing themselves in the magical story.
Not nearly as charming as Harry Potter, or nearly as intense as The Hunger Games, it still works as an interesting mash-up of a lot of elements from both. The open ending leaves room for more of everything, and fantasy fans will want to find out what happens next.","Parents need to know that Legacy and the Queen is the first of a planned fantasy series created by retired NBA star Kobe Bryant (The Wizenard Series): It's about a girl named Legacy, from the provinces, who goes to the royal tennis academy in the palace to train for a tournament. If she wins, she'll be able to save the orphanage her father runs back home. There's some mild scariness from fantasy creatures and spooky atmospheres and a past trauma briefly remembered; rare name calling is sometimes affectionate, otherwise there's no strong language; there's no romance; one adult acts slightly drunk.

The Lost Crown,Moving fictional diaries of Russia's last four tsarinas.,"Sarah Miller's historical novel follows the last few years of Russia's final Imperial family, the Romanovs, from the perspective of Tsar Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra's four daughters. Each chapter shifts the point of view between the four grand duchesses: smart Olga, doting Tatiana, sweet Maria, and mischievous Anastasia. Starting from the preamble to World War I in 1914 and continuing until the family's execution in 1918, the diary-style entries detail how the sisters handled everything from tending to wounded soldiers to their father's abdication and the subsequent years of house arrest, frightening transfers, and their final days before being executed along with their parents and four loyal staffers.
","After years of extensive research, Miller provides an amazingly detailed fictionalization of how the four grand duchesses spent their final years. Although it's not the most gripping novel at the start, the ""action"" picks up after the family's faith healer, Grigori Rasputin, is killed and their father abdicates. For many teens, it will be difficult to relate to these young women, who've been brought up in the isolated manner of all royal children, but parts of their story are universal: they long to be free of their constraints; they dote on but are jealous of their spoiled but chronically ill baby brother, Alexei; they love their parents unconditionally; they are closer even than the March girls of Little Women but still fight; they wonder if they'll ever fall in love, marry, have children. In the end, it's the girls' struggle to hold on to the beautifully ordinary aspects of daily family life that will move readers.","Parents need to know that this book is a fictionalized diary of Tsar Nicholas II's four daughters in the final years of their lives. The novel is based on the author's exhaustive research, but some teens may need help sorting out fact from fiction. The sisters mention but don't really witness any violence, as for the most part they were decently treated even in captivity. There's still some gritty material: As wartime Red Cross nurses, they discuss injured soldiers, amputations, and death -- and the family's ultimate execution is graphically described. Anyone who reads this book will learn a great deal about the Romanov family, although not so much about the revolution that led to their family's demise.

The Wish List,"Wicked is the key word here, in all its senses.","Meg Finn's short life has been a mess. Her mother is dead, her stepfather abusive, and she has fallen in with the wrong people and turned petty delinquent. But when a burglary goes wrong she and Belch, the brutal moron who talked her into it, are killed. Belch, merged with his pet pit bull, goes straight to Hell, but Meg, whose good and bad deeds are perfectly balanced, is sent back to atone and tip the balance by helping the old man, Lowrie McCall, whom they tried to rob.
Lowrie is a dying old curmudgeon who has a list of things he wants to do before he dies, and it's Meg's job to help him succeed. But Beelzebub, on orders from the Devil, sends Belch, armed with a nasty computer chip in what's left of his brain, to make sure she fails. But even without his interference her trip may not get her through \""the Pearlies:\"" almost everything Lowrie wants to do is illegal, and Meg still wants revenge on her stepfather.
","Eoin Colfer knows how to grab his readers: The first 10 pages contain a robbery, a pit bull attack, a shooting, and the death of the two main characters in a fiery explosion. And he knows how to hold them, with a combination of action, B-movie cliche, black humor, and gritty, muscular prose that hints at more violence than it actually reveals. It's no wonder he's the darling of the video-game generation. Reluctant readers and avid ones all enjoy his books, and with good reason.
Wicked is the key word here, in all its senses. It describes Colfer's humor, his no-kid-gloves approach to his readers, and, quite literally, the plot. He manages here a view of the afterlife that is cynically funny without being out-and-out blasphemous (and least to this reviewer) and makes a weird kind of sense to boot. While this book lacks anyone quite as funny as Foaly in the Artemis Fowl books, it makes up for it with a bit more heart -- nothing soppy, of course, this is a Eoin Colfer book after all, but just the hint of a warm glow in the testy developing relationship between a crusty old never-was and a hardened little never-will-be. Colfer may talk tough and mean to thrill his audience, but it's just possible he has a heart of mush.","Parents need to know that Colfer offers a view of the afterlife that may conflict with some religious beliefs; you might want to have a chat with your child about this topic.

Friend Is Not a Verb,Mystery + romance + wannabe rock stars adds up to good fun.,"As in The After Life, the author creates a strange cast of characters and mysterious circumstances to create a compelling and moving book. Hen's girlfriend breaks up with him and kicks him out of the band on the same night that his sister reappears after being missing for a year. Now Hen's determined to play bass well enough to get back into Petra's band AND solve the mystery of why Sarah and her college friends mysteriously disappeared. But something a little more normal is going on in his life, too: He realizes that he's in love with the girl next door.
","The author has put together a winning combination of mystery, romance, and coming-of-age novel. Plus, it's downright funny at times (like when Petra, the self-centered lead singer of Hen's band, names their group PETRA). Readers may not know how seriously to take Hen's dreams of rock stardom, but they'll definitely find themselves cheering when Hen and Emma FINALLY admit their feelings for each other. One of the things that's really great about this book is that the characters are all weird and annoying at times, yet they really look out for one another (like Emma, who admits she tried to ""sabotage"" Hen's gig in an attempt to protect him from getting hurt).","Parents need to know that there's a mystery at the center of this book: Hen's sister Sarah has been missing for a year, and she's a fugitive when she returns (though her crime is not a violent one). Other than that, there's nothing too alarming here: Hen's neighbor Emma shows up with beer at his band practices (and gets very drunk). One dad offers Hen a hit of marijuana, while another is known to drink heavily. Some innocent kissing, some light swearing.  But at the end there's a gentle message about supporting and protecting the people you love -- even when you're not so sure of what they're up to.

Desert Angel,Teen flees mom's killer in gripping thriller.,"Fourteen-year-old Angel flees violent meth-head, sexual abuser, and skilled hunter-tracker Scotty after he murders her drug-addled mother and comes after her because she knows he did it. With few resources of her own after a rootless existence with her mom, and in the middle of the California desert, she must rely on the kindness of chance-met strangers to survive. A hardscrabble community of Mexican Americans, some of whose immigration status is uncertain, puts itself in danger to help her, confronting her with moral issues she's never considered about the impact of her own troubles on others as her thoughts veer between survival and revenge.
","Price won an Edgar Award for 2010's The Interrogation of Gabriel James, and this book keeps up the standard for its well-crafted, fast-moving plot and engaging characters. It's a window into a world whose darkness most readers won't personally experience, but they'll find much to admire in Angel's tenacity and resourcefulness, and much to think about in the lessons she learns along the way.","Parents need to know that this follow-up to last year's Edgar Award winner, The Interrogation of Gabriel James, is a taut, well-written page-turner that benefits from the author's experience working with troubled youth. Angel's whole life has been something parents hope their own kids never experience: a drug-addicted mom with more optimism than sense, whose succession of abusive men culminates in Scotty, a cunning meth-head who abuses Angel sexually (though we're spared the details), murders her mother, and is bent on killing her, as well. In order to save her own life, the 14-year-old, sporadically homeschooled Angel, in the middle of the desert and dependent on the kindness of strangers, must call on resources she didn't know she had -- and become a person she didn't know she was.

The House in Poplar Wood,"Teens bond, match wits with Death in riveting tale.","THE HOUSE IN POPLAR WOOD sits on the outskirts of Boone Ridge, Tennessee, which like all other villages in the region is ruled by the Shades: Passion, Memory, and Death, and the families whose legacy it is to serve them and/or keep them in line. It's a house divided; on one side 13-year-old Lee Vickery lives with his mom, apprentice to the Shade Memory, while on the other side of the wall live his twin, Felix, and their dad, who serve Death. (Lee has an otherwise deaf ear, which hears only what Memory is saying; Felix has a blind eye that keeps track of what Death is up to.) Lee in particular is determined to free the twins from their bond to the Shades so they can have a real life, but previous attempts haven't gone well. Meanwhile, across town, Gretchen Whipple, the mayor's daughter, is starting to ask a lot of questions following the untimely death of a local teen -- including why she's not supposed to be friends with Lee and Felix, nd delving into some family secrets of her own.
","K.E. Ormsbee delivers a fresh, imaginative, creepy, and cheer-worthy tale of three teens trying to break family curses, escape dark forces, and do the right thing for themselves and their loved ones. The House in Poplar Wood conjures up a seemingly ordinary town where people have long been ruled by Passion, Memory, and Death, in which there's a buried secret just about everywhere you look. Small illustrations by The Brothers Hilts at the start of each chapter help bring the distinctive protagonists Lee, Felix, and Gretchen to life.","Parents need to know that The House in Poplar Wood is a riveting tale of 13-year-olds growing up in a Tennessee village ruled by the Shades -- Passion, Memory, and Death -- and their attempts to free themselves and their families.

A teen's violent death causes suspicion and sets assorted events in motion.

Chasing Shadows,Realistic teen tragedy blends well with fantasy graphics.,"CHASING SHADOWS, a graphic/traditional-novel hybrid, tells the story in words and pictures of twins Holly and Corey and best-friend Savitri in the final months of their senior year in high school. Their lives are dramatically altered when, on the way home from free running, Holly and Corey are victims of a shooting and Savitri is a witness to it. Holly's mechanism for coping is to retreat into fantasy as she imagines herself becoming a superhero called The Leopardess. The different ways she and Savitri cope with the knowledge that their lives could end at any random moment drastically affects their friendship and their future.
","In Chasing Shadows, author Swati Avasthi creates realistic, believable characters whose older-teen interactions are particularly well wrought. The different narrative voices are distinct and well balanced and offer nuanced looks into the heart of a lifelong friendship. The action moves well and builds to a climax that's intense and cathartic while staying refreshingly realistic.
Punctuating the emotionally charged prose are a dozen or so black-and-white illustrated spreads of varying lengths by Craig Phillips. These mostly convey the fantasy afterlife that Holly retreats into as she tries to rebuild her life, but they sometimes ably advance the narrative as well. The spreads are well laid-out and easy to understand, following as they do well-established comic-book conventions.","Parents need to know that Chasing Shadows by Swati Avasthi, with graphic-novel illustrations by Craig Phillips, chronicles the friendship of Holly and Savitri in the aftermath of a random shooting as they learn to cope with their grief and fears. Although the central event is violent, traumatic, and dramatically illustrated and reverberates throughout the book, there's no gore. Some blood is described but none is illustrated. The high school seniors are liberal with swear words, mostly ""f--k"" and ""s--t,"" when talking among themselves but speak appropriately with adults. The few sexual incidents are mainly kisses that aren't described, but some of the background between Holly and Josh involves a scare when Holly thought she might be pregnant.

","Author Chris Colfer's narrative balance of wisdom and wisecracks frequently strikes an odd note in THE ENCHANTRESS RETURNS, but many kids will find that part of the charm. His breezy, engaging style sometimes doesn't quite work with the emotional and ethical issues that drive many characters; squabbling queen-zillas, beloved people dying or in mortal danger, happy reunions and dramatic reversals follow one another with video-game-like pacing and keep the pages turning, though sometimes at the expense of character development beyond the cartoon stage.","Parents need to know that The Enchantress Returns is the second installment in Glee star Chris Colfer's Land of Stories series; the first book, The Wishing Spell, hit No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list. Colfer's many subplots gallop along at a breakneck pace, mixing swordplay, high tragedy, low comedy, poignant partings, and tender reunions in a creative tale with positive values and great heart. Colfer's narrative voice is often like that of a precocious, snarky middle-schooler, blending slang, pretentious words, and occasional innuendo with gusto.

"Breaking Dawn: The Twilight Saga, Book 4",Last book of supernatural soap saga is slightly more mature.,"Despite Bella's initial reluctance to be a teen bride, she and her beloved vampire Edward tie the knot at the beginning of BREAKING DAWN. Then comes the honeymoon ... which leaves Bella pregnant with a baby that saps her strength and health as quickly as it grows inside her. The baby's birth leads to massive changes in the lives of all of the series' main characters, particularly werewolf Jacob and Bella herself. It could also lead to more trouble from the meddling Italian Volturi -- which prompts the Cullens to recruit a virtual army ready to stand by their side at any cost.
","Fans finally get what they want at the beginning of this fourth book in the bestselling Twilight Saga: a fairytale wedding, a honeymoon, and s-e-x. Once that's out of the way, teens who are just in it for the romance shouldn't go any further. The small percentage of readers who are in it for the blood and supernatural creatures will find both, but one of the creatures turns out to be pretty bizarre and ridiculous, and there aren't enough compelling plot twists and suspenseful moments to carry the book through the full 755 pages. There's plenty of talking, though. And fear that something really sinister is coming for all of them. But when the force they all fear does finally come for them, all the build-up goes nowhere.
 All the books in the series always ran too long, but they made up for the length with fun fantasy characters, plenty of romantic tension, and a good final battle at the end. This time the characters get everything they want at the beginning of the book and leave fans hanging at the end.","Parents need to know that this series is enormously popular with teen and older tween girls.

Edie lways knew that her mother was adopted and had been raised in a White family, but she didn't think to press her mom on the topic, until she and her friends discovered a mysterious box tucked into a corner of the attic. Inside the box are rtifacts of a life lived before Edie's time, but the connections to her mother's past prove to hold more pain than Edie had expected. ","This beautifully and simply told tale explores the ripple effects of a long-held family secret. Though couched in the rhythms of a loving family's life in modern-day Seattle, the sad truths of the past pierce  tween's life, and her rage at being left out of the unspoken past feels appropriate and proportional.
Inside of this loving, if basic, tale lies some serious truth. As Edie's mom says, ""For many years, Native children were forcibly removed from their families and communities."" The author, who identifies s the ""daughter of a Native American Upper Skagit/Nooksack/Blackfeet/Nez Perce adoptee,"" is making a point: U.S. history is full of tragic stories of coercion and force.

The Hired Girl,"Absorbing tale of feisty, sweet teen will hook girls.","Fourteen-year-old Joan Skraggs lives a miserable existence on her Philadelphia farm in 1911. Her mother has died, her father is uncaring and verbally abusive, and he's sent away her teacher and burned her books so she can take on all the domestic work. But Joan wants to make her own way in the world, and if her father won't pay her for her work, she'll find someone who will. A newspaper ad for a hired girl proves just the solution -- now all Joan has to do is run away, change her name, lie about her age, and procure work. Luckily, she meets a kind Jewish man in Baltimore who takes her in and offers her the most challenging work of her young life, opening her up to a world of books, affluence, crushes, despair, and a worldly education she never imagined, if she can just keep her true identity under wraps.
","This fictional diary of a feisty, pure-hearted girl who craves self-betterment is a stunner of a novel. Young Joan finds her way through new experiences involving religious clashes, hard work, young love, missteps of class and manners, and mind-broadening reading. But what makes her relatable are all her girlish daydreams and impulses, her well-intentioned meddling, class-related foibles, and efforts at improving her hardscrabble existence to become acceptable in more affluent society. Along the way, readers will be challenged to examine their own biases about love and religion and immerse themselves in a world on the cusp of big changes for women, the economy, and households everywhere. An absorbing read that offers a kaleidoscope of history, feminism, and class issues through a young girl's poignant coming of age.","Parents need to know that The Hired Girl is Newbery medalist Laura Amy Schlitz's moving, deftly conceived, engrossing fictional diary of a 14-year-old farm girl from Philadelphia who runs away nd takes a job cleaning house for a Jewish family in 1911 Baltimore. Protagonist Joan Skraggs is a complex, rash, and headstrong character who is by turns noble, impetuous, and even sometimes dishonest, but her aspirations, concerns, and obsessions are relatable. There are moments of verbal abuse (and near physical abuse) from her father, a recurring theme of grief over the loss of her mother, some flirtations and sexual situations (groping, kissing), and frank religious discussions of Jewish persecution. But it's primarily an uplifting tale about a girl's desire to educate herself, earn her own way, and move up in the world with common sense and compassion.

McCracken's daughter, Summer, Teddy tracks down clues and learns a lot about zoo animals, ethics, and uncovering the truth in Texas whodunnit style.
","From Stuart Gibbs, the same author who wrote the clever, madcap Spy School and Spy Camp, BELLY UP offers just as much thrill, suspense, and teen boy hilarity, only this time, at a zoo. Here, Teddy Fitzroy's another precocious kid who's misunderstood or whose talents are quite recognized in his particular setting, but who works to earn respect, overcome assumptions, and win the day. There are graphic descriptions here that could be off-putting to the faint of heart, and a few fat jokes that don't quite seem necessary. At times Fitroy's voice is a bit more adult-like than one might expect from a 12-year-old boy, and the jokes can be a little dated, but this is a fun, engaging read that moves through suspense as if it written for the big screen.
Kids interested in animals, research, or science will find a lot to engage with here, and parents can appreciate a book that continually reasserts the importance of research, ethics, and science in the treatment of animals and dealings within the adult world.","Parents need to know that Belly Up is an entertaining and clever mystery novel from Stuart Gibbs about the death of a hippo at a zoo, told from the perspective of a 12-year-old boy. There are graphic descriptions of animals' deaths, autopsies, and detailed descriptions of bowel habits, as well as some crass body function references, and a handful of fat jokes about heavy female characters in the book. But, overall, the book promotes research, science, education, and adventure, and raises some interesting, complicated questions about ethics and personal integrity in trying to do the right thing.

","With vivid panoramas and moving close-ups, award-winning author-illustrator Kadir Nelson amplifies the meaning of King's words. There are close-up portraits of King's face as well as pictures of black and white kids and adults together, holding hands and standing up for freedom, justice, and equality. Even if you feel you've heard this speech a million times, Nelson's stunning full-color paintings give it new life, underscoring the intensity and raw truth of King's message. The pictures are big and bold and the text spare, so even little kids can grasp the historical moment and its lasting impact.","Parents need to know that I Have a Dream illustrates excerpts of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famous speech, delivered from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial at the March on Washington in 1963.

A Couple of Boys Have the Best Week Ever,Giggles abound in friendship-focused read-aloud.,"James and Eamon experience a week of pure bliss while visiting Eamon's grandparents.
","The book is full of moments that kids will appreciate s James and Eamon spend a week together with Eamon's grandparents. They stuff themselves with banana waffles, play lots of video games, and wrestle. In other words, the title is no lie (though the outdoorsy-vacation look of the book's cover is a little deceiving). Especially kids who have been lovingly spoiled by grandparents will love details from the coffee ice-cream icebergs with hard chocolate sauce to the grandparents' willingness to let James and Eamon set the schedule, even if it means a day full of video games instead of the aquarium trip grandpa suggests.
Balloon dialog humorously belies some of the text, making for some funny juxtapositions. For example, while the story follows that ""he had never been away from home for an entire week, so he was very sad when his mother drove away,"" James is grinning enthusiastically and yelling ""BYE!"" A terrific story for kids and parents, it's a read-aloud that parents won't mind having to read aloud.

The Further Tale of Peter Rabbit,"Peter goes to Scotland in inspired charmer, fun read-aloud.","Peter Rabbit feels he needs a change of scene and squeezes under the gate to once again steal a lettuce from Mr. McGregor's garden, only to find ""an interesting basket smelling of onions"" and hop in, devouring the picnic lunch inside and falling asleep. When Peter wakes up, he finds the basket is on a moving cart, which has taken him from his home all the way to Scotland. When it stops and he's discovered, he bolts and soon runs into a distant cousin, a big black bunny named Finlay McBurney. Peter is taken into the McBurneys' burrow, fed, and put to bed, and in the morning goes with Finlay to the Games, a competition among different rabbit clans, where Peter's hunger again leads to mischief -- this time in a radish toss that could unseat the champion: Finlay McBurney himself.
","Oscar-winning actress Emma Thompson does a fantastic job of capturing the tone, humor, and charm of the original Beatrix Potter stories about the now century-plus-old Peter Rabbit character. And Eleanor Taylor's illustrations are equally true to the source. The story is gentle and dryly witty, either read on the page or dramatically narrated by Thompson on an accompanying audio CD with music. It's especially fun to hear her speak in Finlay McBurney's Scotts accent. The entire package should delight little ones as well as their parents. ","Parents need to know that The Further Tale of Peter Rabbit is an original story by Oscar-wining actress/screenwriter Emma Thompson that's based on the classic Beatrix Potter books. Peter was created in the very early 1900s, but Thompson picks up where Potter left off, and it's a seamless transition, even as she takes the mischievous bunny laddie all the way to Scotland as an accidental stowaway in a picnic basket. The spirit, tone, dry wit, and sweet illustrations by Eleanor Taylor all honor the original while creating a stand-alone delight. The hardcover comes with an audio CD of Thomson reading the story -- and relishing the Scottish accents -- accompanied by lilting music.

Home at Last,Fears faced openly when loving dads adopt older boy.,"HOME AT LAST is the story of Lester, a boy who's weathered some very rough knocks. His parents died in a car crash, he lived with his grandma until she got sick, and then in an institution. But now he's adopted by two dads, Daddy Rich and Daddy Albert, who bring him to their urban home and fix up a nice room for him, though Lester's scared at night and creeps into their room for comfort. After repeated sleepless nights, Daddy Albert loses his temper. Lester expresses his strong fears, and the family pup presents a happy solution. He trots in to sleep on Lester's bed, providing the nightly comfort the boy needs.
","In this sensitive portrait of a loving and recognizably human family facing very real challenges, an older boy's adopted by two dads and has trouble trusting he won't be yanked from his new home. Author Vera Williams excels at joyously inclusive portraits of hardworking families. (Her classic A Chair for My Mother, still immensely popular, celebrated a girl and single mom struggling after a fire.) Chris Raschka illustrates Home at Last with much the same bright splashes of color that characterized William's own art.
What distinguishes Home at Last is the honest detail, the acknowledgement that there are no easy answers or quick fixes. It takes a year for the dads to adopt. Lester's neediness persists, trying the family, and Daddy Albert, who can be loving and supportive, has a fiery temper. But Williams is deft at the touching detail. When the dads make cocoa for Lester in the wee hours, and when Lester playfully rams his head into Daddy Rich's belly, we know these humans are trying their best to forge a family and are lucky to have found each other.","Parents need to know that Home at Last is the last book by beloved author-illustrator Vera B. Williams, whose brightly colored Caldecott Honor books (A Chair for My Mother) pioneered progressive themes of inclusion, and who collaborated here with friend and Caldecott winner Chris Raschka (The Hello, Goodbye Window). This story, in which school-age Lester's adopted by Daddy Albert and Daddy Rich, has clear adoption and LGBT themes, but the feelings will be recognizable to any kid who's felt anxiety. Daddy Albert's loving but has a temper, and Lester, who lost his ""first parents"" in a car crash then bounced from grandma to an institution, has fears that aren't easily soothed. The book's most appropriate for older kids who can stick with the longer text and handle thornier emotions.

If I Stay,"Gripping, unsentimental look at teen in coma.","Mia, a gifted cellist who may be heading to Julliard next year, barely survives a horrific car accident that kills her family. As her broken body is extracted from the wreck, rushed to the hospital, and worked on by doctors, Mia hovers between life and death in a coma. She finds herself out of body, able to walk invisibly through the hospital and listen in on family, friends, doctors, and nurses. Roaming the corridors and her memories, she realizes that she has a choice: Does she want to struggle through a life without a family and perhaps crippling injuries, or will she let go and perhaps rejoin the loved ones she has lost?
","Media about dying teens often plays out as mawkish melodramas; how satisfying, then, to find a book that's actually well-written, compelling, honest, and unsentimentally moving. Through Mia's disembodied thoughts and flashbacks we get to know not only her, but also her quirky, semi-punk parents, her sweetly energetic brother, her friends, and especially her boyfriend, Adam -- and all of them are appealing characters.
Despite the supernatural, out-of-body premise, author Gayle Forman keeps Mia's story grittily real, perhaps a bit excessively so in the accident scene (which demonstrates the power of metaphor and grim humor to unsettle the reader), but also in the characterizations, relationships, and hospital routines. She lets the situation play itself out matter-of-factly, relying on the power of the events to speak for themselves, rather than bringing in the literary equivalent of throbbing violins to wring sobs out of readers. This is moving and very thought-provoking, but never manipulative or melodramatic.
	 ","Parents need to know that this is a book for teens about a girl who loses her family in a car accident -- and is now in a coma. In addition to plenty of swearing and sexual material (including a steamy scene of mutual masturbation), it deals with the aftermath of the gruesome accident as Mia decides if she wants to live or die. This book can spark discussions about a range of topics, including unusual narrators to more intense talks about what they would do in Mia's place. Readers who enjoyed this book may want to check out its sequel, Where She Went.

"The Winner's Kiss: The Winner's Trilogy, Book 3",Winning trilogy ends on a more mature note.,"When Kestrel is discovered as a spy at the end of The Winner's Crime, she is sent to the tundra to do hard labor, a mercy when the punishment for treason is usually death. But it doesn't feel like a mercy to Kestrel. The food is drugged to make her work harder during the day, sleep at night, and slowly forget who she even is. An escape attempt leads to a whipping, and afterward she succumbs to the power of the drugs. Arin, meanwhile, makes his way back to Herran with his new allies from Dacra who have vowed to help him fight. There's no way around an all-out war after the Valorian emperor poisoned his country's water supply, leaving everyone too sick to fight. As they get their energy back and war is imminent, word comes from Valoria about Kestrel's capture. Arin, feeling both responsible and heartsick, is determined to free Kestrel before he takes on the Valorian Emperor.
","Fans of the series will all-out devour the nail-biting jailbreak opener and the twisty climax of this finale; the middle takes a bit more patience. Rutkoski's writing is lovely, full of thoughtful imagery and depth. It's usually an asset, but as Kestrel grapples with her hazy memory after the prison drugs and Arin tries to bring her back to herself, there's so much to ponder. Who is she now? Does Arin love her out of guilt? Could she just use him to help her remember who she was before? Does she want to be that person again? It feels as hazy for the reader as it does for Kestrel, and the author's beautiful prose loses its impact.
Luckily, as soon as the characters set up camp for battle, the pace builds again -- and Kestrel magically finds her mojo again. That requisite ""all hope is lost"" moment in every underdog battle really feels that way in THE WINNER'S KISS, making the ending all that more surprising and satisfying.","Parents need to know that Marie Rutkoski's The Winner's Kiss is the last book in a romantic fantasy trilogy, following The Winner's Curse and The Winner's Crime. Expect more mature content in this finale. Book 2 took place mostly in a palace, not on the battlefield such as in The Winner's Kiss. Readers are taken right into the middle of bloody battles with swords, daggers, arrows, and explosions from cannons and early versions of guns. Every kind of assault is up close: beheadings, many horses injured with spikes and stabbed swords to unseat riders, stabbings into the weak points of armor, an arm chopped off, throats slit, shrapnel loaded into cannons shredding victims into ""bloody chunks,"" and necks snapped. Outside of battles, the main character is drugged repeatedly and whipped, then suffers from drug withdrawal. At the center of the series are star-crossed lovers Kestrel and Arin, who went from a few passionate kisses in Book 2 to having sex (not well described) in The Winner's Kiss. They both drink a little, and their ally, Prince Roshar, often smokes a pipe. Even though war rages in this story and many die, readers are shown how cunning and strategy are more effective weapons than swords, gun powder, and massive numbers of fighting soldiers. Revenge drives main characters for most of the story to seek out those who wronged them, but the power of mercy prevails.

"Slow Burn:  The Anchor and Sophia, Book 2",Absorbing second installment ramps up the adventure.,"In SLOW BURN, war is now inevitable between rival cities in this far-future setting. The Anchor is  religious city that fears and forbids technological advancemen. Sophia's a city that values the pursuit of knowledge above all else. Caught in the middle are the Wesah, a matriarchal and nomadic society with plenty of reasons to mistrust both The Anchor and Sophia. Clive, Clover, and Paz are now all pursuing their own agenda, and each will have to decide how far they're willing to go, and what price they'll ask themselves and others to pay to get what they want. Meanwhile, Gemma's been kidnapped by the Wesah, but before long her desire to escape starts being replaced by a glimpse into a way of life more fulfilling and empowering than she ever imagined possible. As the four of them dance around truth and lies, good and evil, past and present, the decisions they make will have ramifications for the future that none can see.
","This absorbing second installment of a trilogy sets aside world building and establishing characters in favor of advancing the four main storylines with plenty of action, adventure, and intrigue. Author Tommy Wallach deftly weaves the lives of Clive, Clover, Paz, and Gemma toward and away from each other at a Slow Burn, but each storyline advances at a good pace with plenty of twists and turns along the way.
Teens who haven't read the first book, Strange Fire, may not know the characters well enough to feel a strong connection to them, but they will relate to the themes of figuring out right from wrong, putting what you want ahead of others, and whether doing something bad is ever justified if it leads to something good. The plot steadily, relentlessly builds tension and dread right up to the cliffhanger ending that will have readers eager to find out what happens next.","Parents need to know that Tommy Wallach's Slow Burn is the second of a planned trilogy that began with Strange Fire. Reading Strange Fire first is strongly recommended; although it's not strictly necessary to understand the plot, it will definitely provide a deeper understanding of the characters' journeys and the themes explored. Women's sexuality and how different societies treat women is explored in more depth, especially through a same-sex relationship with kissing, manual stimulation, and sexual satisfaction described without being explicit. Violence includes fights, killings, and some descriptions of torture with non-graphic descriptions of blood and pain. Teens occasionally drink beer, wine, ""shine"" (moonshine), and liqueur in a world with no drinking age. A substance called ""dreamtea"" is used to induce hallucinations that are used to see the future, and one hallucinogenic ""trip"" is described in detail. Strong language includes ""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""damn,"" ""bitches,"" and ""whore."" Minor or background characters are occasionally mentioned smoking. Themes explored include questions about whether or how much harm is OK if it's done to create a better world, how technological advances are used, and women's ability to pursue self-fulfillment in male-dominated societies.

Percy Jackson's Greek Heroes,"Often tragic, often bloody stories with a fun Percy twist.","Demigod Percy Jackson offers up the stories of 12 heroes: Perseus, Psyche, Phaethon, Otrera, Daedalus, Theseus, Atalanta, Bellerophon, Cyrene, Orpheus, Hercules, and Jason. He relays the deeds these characters are still famous for today -- slaying the Minotaur, playing a mean lyre, founding the Amazons, retrieving the Golden Fleece, and more -- and, in equal measure, shows where they went wrong. Or, as Percy puts it in the introduction, how they ""boldly screwed up where no one had screwed up before."" Most stories in PERCY JACKSON'S GREEK HEROES end in tragedy, but not all do. At the end of Psyche's story, Percy marvels at the happy ending but promises the next hero he talks about -- Phaethon -- is a ""total car wreck of a demigod."" ","If it's possible, this giant, brilliantly illustrated volume is even more absorbing than Percy's take on Greek gods. As in Percy Jackson's Greek Gods, we get the warts-and-all portraits, and there are plenty of warts. Who recalled Hercules had such an anger-management problem? Or that the brilliant inventor Daedalus had such a horrible jealous streak? Author Rick Riordan takes pains to include some fascinating women in the mix -- no doubt they were harder to research than the men, and the extra effort is appreciated. Atalanta and Otrera are especially fascinating as extreme Wonder Women whom no man dared mess with.
Two maps help orient the reader quite well in ancient times. And Percy's modern sardonic-teen voice keeps readers laughing and the pages turning, especially when the character names get unpronounceable and the subject matter gets either too gross or too grim. This is a great book for parents to enjoy right along with kids.","Parents need to know that Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson's Greek Heroes is a hefty gift-size volume that profiles 12 heroes, as narrated by Percy Jackson from the bestselling series. It helps a little to read the Percy Jackson books first and the companion gift-size book Percy Jackson's Greek Gods. If they do so, readers will instantly connect with the narrator and get his sometimes sardonic, sometimes goofy sense of humor. As in Greek Gods, Percy's wit helps smooth things over when the content gets mature. These heroes are not flawless mortals -- far from it. The body count is high. The worst of it includes killing one's own family (Medea kills her sons to punish Jason, Theseus kills his son out of jealously, Hercules takes out his family in a sudden rage more than once). Heads (Medusa's and others') and body parts are hacked off on about five occasions. (Worst: Daughters are tricked into hacking up their father.) Many are killed in battle, and there's talk of babies left in the woods to die (although a she-bear found baby Atalanta and raised her). There's plenty of talk of gods and mortals having affairs without much detail and a big ""gross-out"" alert from Percy about Pasiphae's affair with a bull (Aphrodite tricked her into it). The Amazons ""got chummy with"" Gargareans at a ""sleepover party"" once a year and had babies nine months later. There's some drunkenness that often leads to fighting and killing with later regret. Kudos to author Riordan for the extra effort to include four female heroes in the dozen, while pointing out that at the time they didn't get their due. Parents should definitely read along with kids for a great refresher on all these legendary characters. You can talk about the hard lessons the heroes learn along the way, as well as each hero's fatal flaw and how it often leads to his or her undoing.

"The Golden Specific: The Mapmakers Trilogy, Book 2",Complex fantasy sequel more absorbing than first book.,"Sophia is back in New Occident -- 1890s Boston -- still determined to find her parents. She's thrilled when she uncovers clues to a diary her mother kept on the journey when she went missing. The only problem: The library where she found the lead is run by the fanatical cult, and the library where the diary is kept is across the ocean in Spain, which is stuck in an earlier time period and ravaged by a strange disease. Still, she's determined to book passage across the Atlantic and finds an easy way onto a ship departing the next day. When she can't convince her Uncle Shadrack to accompany her, she and her friend Theo make plans to meet on the ship and escape in secret. But disaster strikes at Uncle Shadrack's house before Theo can sneak off: The prime minister is found dead in the map room, and Theo hides himself and the clearly forged evidence of Uncle Shaddrack's guilt in the closet while he waits for the authorities to leave. Sadly, Sophia's ship leaves before the police do and Sophia sets off alone.
","In this sequel, Sophia's lone journey across the ocean to a distant time with a mysterious magical world trapped inside is just one of the intriguing mysteries packed in its 500-plus pages. There's also the murder of the New Occident prime minister in Uncle Shadrack's house, the disappearance of healers called the Eerie, the discovery of a book on a ship written in the future, and so much more.
Author S.E. Grove loves to stack up the mysteries and does a better job in THE GOLDEN SPECIFIC than she did in The Glass Sentence, balancing mystery with almost enough clues to lead the reader along. But still expect some head-scratching over how everything fits together. This sequel is a treat for fans of rich fantasy and will be enjoyed by adults too.","Parents need to know that The Golden Specific is the second book in the Mapmakers Trilogy, following The Glass Sentence. Publishers are marketing this series to ages 10 and up. Although the maturity of the content is about right for the age, this story is pretty complex; readers 12 and up are more likely to stick with it. In search of her parents, the resourceful main character, Sophia, lies to get information and ends up stranded by herself in a foreign land where people are dying of a strange disease. There are many stories of people being rounded up and quarantined before they die, including one of a girl whose mother wanders off before she can infect her daughter. More violence in the story includes a man found dead, another killed with a sword, sea creatures killing men in a shipwreck, giant birds attacking, arson and riots, and people sentenced to walk into a world where they can lose their faces (high creep factor) and get stabbed by poisonous thorns. Readers fully immersed in this world full of fractured time periods can ponder a whole lot of what-ifs: What if the U.S. Civil War never happened or the United States never expanded West?

The Best of Iggy,Funny look at boy whose impulsive ideas get the best of him.,"THE BEST OF IGGY introduces fourth-grader Iggy Frangi, who doesn't mean to get in trouble but keeps stumbling into it when he gets an idea, doesn't think through the possible consequences, and plunges ahead anyway. The unseen narrator speaks directly to the reader to frame the story and explain Iggy's thinking (or nonthinking) process. Iggy jumps off his roof onto a trampoline and taunts a boy he doesn't like into doing it, too. Angry that his older sister is babysitting him, he makes a mess with shaving cream (for white hair and beard), his mom's lipstick (for blood), nd eyeliner (for wrinkles) to scare her as a wounded, bleeding old man. And, finally, he comes up with a prank during class that ends up physically injuring his favorite teacher. Will Iggy learn from his mistakes? ","This story of a boy prone to getting in trouble is funny, relatable, and thought-provoking as it explores how things can get out of hand if you don't think about consequences. With a light touch and loads of humor, author Annie Barrows gets into the head of someone who's not a bad kid but veers into some bad actions for typical reasons -- because he's bored or lonely, to look tough to another kid, to annoy his older sister, to feel like a leader in his friend group, and to get a reaction from his teacher. ""It was like his brain had gone on vacation,"" the narrator says in the middle of one of his pranks. The Best of Iggy feels real, and Ram Ricks' fun illustrations do a great job of showing us Iggy's world, his feelings, and his fantasies.
The story also shows Iggy's growth over time. Even if Iggy can't explain why he did something impulsive, he ultimately understands why it was wrong and hurtful, and he sincerely says he's sorry. Which is a great place for kids to see a character get to. ","Parents need to know that The Best of Iggy is by Annie Barrows, author of the popular Ivy + Bean series.

The boy gets ""slammed to the ground"" but doesn't get hurt. An adult gets mildly injured when Iggy and his friends crash into her with their school desks. Iggy reflects on his choices (after they go haywire), and the narrator explores the nature of getting carried away with an idea that could be reckless or hurtful, doing it anyway, and later regretting it -- and learning from it.

The Garden of Abdul Gasazi,Terrific drawings star in imaginative tale.,"Positively No Dogs Allowed, reads the sign in front of the magician's garden, but Fritz breaks free from Alan and disappears among the mysterious topiary bushes and paths. What happens to the dog? Chris Van Allsburg's award-winning drawings lead readers to the answer.
 ","Readers may be confused about what Allsburg is trying to say: Is this about the consequences of breaking the rules, or is it simply about a child's sense of enchantment? Maybe both.
Spooky houses and gardens populate every child's neighborhood, and in this story, the hero must face his fears to retrieve the bad dog he's responsible for. The lesson of what happens when one disregards warnings is soft-pedaled. However, Van Allsburg's drawings are clearly terrific. Drawn in black and white and all shades between, the pictures have depth and grandeur -- like the one of the magician's house, which rises high into the sky. Van Allsburg has captured the story's eeriness with shadowed paths, looming topiary, and an imposing magician.","Parents need to know that the lesson of what happens when one disregards warnings is soft-pedaled.

Bitterblue,"Graceling sequel overlong, but strong heroine shines.","Queen Bitterblue of Monsea knows that her advisors are hiding things from her. She wants to truly know her kingdom and how it's coping after decades of her late father King Leck's tyrannical rule. So she dons a disguise and slips out at night, visiting bars where stories of her kingdom are told late into the night. She also meets a handsome thief named Saf and his friend, Teddy, who runs a printing press. The stories and her new friends have a powerful influence over her, persuading her to dig further into the horrible mysteries of Leck's rule. But it's not that easy. Leck destroyed hundreds of books -- mostly of real Monsean history -- and secret passages, locked doors, haunting art, and mazes all over the castle are guarding his secrets well. Plus people who call themselves \""truthseekers\"" are being hunted down and killed just outside her castle walls. Who will do anything to keep King Leck's secrets, and why?
","Graceling was great, Fire was amazing; BITTERBLUE had a lot to live up to, and it does a pretty good job. Queen Bitterblue is another one of Kristin Cashore's fantastic heroines -- a great ruler despite unspeakable odds against her, and a knife always at the ready to defend herself (and she uses it well). But her love interest, Saf, is no Prince Po or Lord Brigan (the heroes of the earlier books). After he does too much stealing and brawling, Saf isn't even that sympathetic a character. It's almost better that the romantic story fizzles out too easily.
	The pressure was on to make King Leck's big secrets truly haunting -- but since most readers will already know that Leck was a psychopath, they're not really a huge surprise. The best part of Bitterblue is the hunt for answers, through ciphers, linens, a spy's keys, a river of bones, and one very talented librarian; all of the pieces are exquisitely woven together. Also, a great twist makes a sequel a real possibility -- so bring on the next great heroine.","Parents need to know that, in this sequel to Graceling, Queen Bitterblue is dealing with the aftermath of her father's long reign. He was a psychopath who tortured, raped, and mutilated his subjects, and Bitterblue slowly uncovers details about these atrocities (just enough to shock; the rest is left to the imagination). That makes the book's other violence -- including near-kidnappings and stabbings, plus a couple of suicides due to madness -- seem quite minor in comparison. There are mentions of some same-sex couples, a heterosexual sex scene that's not really described, and one character who's often too drunk to come to work. As in Kristin Cashore's other books, Graceling and Fire, readers will find in Bitterblue a stand-out heroine who discovers her own strength through plenty of trials and suffering.

Amelia's Middle-School Graduation Yearbook,"Fun illustrated ""journal"" explores early teen anxieties.","AMELIA'S MIDDLE-SCHOOL GRADUATION YEARBOOK chronicles Amelia's last few months in middle school through words and pictures, as she readies herself to enter high school without her best friend Carly by her side because Carly's parents are sending her to private school. Amelia worries about everything, from navigating the halls of the high school to embarrassing herself in front of the ""cool"" kids or boys she likes. She uses her journal as a way to remember all the good times she had in middle school, as well as to cope with the big changes coming her way.
","Author-illustrator Marissa Moss easily captures the voice of a teen girl, and the writing and illustrations have a very realistic feel. Amelia's Middle-School Graduation Yearbook is filled with all the teen angst you'd expect in a middle schooler's diary but with less melodrama and more humor. Amelia is an ordinary kid and is easily likable; many tweens and young teens will relate to the issues she's dealing with as she transitions to high school. Anyone who's suffered through the agonies of middle school will easily empathize with Amelia, who frets about falling to the bottom of the school social hierarchy as a high school freshman.
Any kid dealing with similar social concerns (and really, in middle school, who doesn't?) will take comfort in Amelia's writing. The journal itself is inspirational, as Amelia works out many of her problems and feels less scared about her future. Don't be surprised if your child sks for a composition notebook of her own.","Parents need to know that Amelia's Middle-School Graduation Yearbook is the final composition notebook ""journal"" in the Amelia's notebook series written and illustrated by Marissa Moss. Fans of this graphic diary-style series (the first title, Amelia's Notebook, was originally published in 1995) as well as those new to the series will appreciate Amelia's quirky sense of humor as she deals with typical teen angst. Amelia creates this journal as a memento of her middle school years and also as a diary to help her grapple with her worries about starting high school without Carly, her best friend since fourth grade. By recounting her conversations with her family and friends, Amelia displays a maturity not typical of most teenagers: She's able to see these issues through her friends' and family members' perspectives nd have some empathy of her own. This book likely will resonate with middle or high school students, many of whom may be inspired to start journaling their own experiences.

The Princess in Black and the Perfect Princess Party,Guests wait while princess fights monsters in fun sequel.,"Princess Magnolia is all set for the perfect birthday party when her glitter-stone ring sounds the alarm that there's a monster attack. She must dash into the broom closet, change out of her puffy pink dress and glass slippers, and get into her Princess in Black pants outfit and boots, jump on her faithful pony, Blackie (after he removes his Frimplepants the unicorn disguise), and fight the monsters that are trying to eat the goats that Duff the goat boy is watching over. The alarm summons her several times, each time delaying when she can open her presents with her party guests. Will she ever get to open them?
","This cute follow-up to the first book should please girls who love imagining a princess party and also enjoy seeing a female superhero fight monsters. The almost-finding-out-her-secret plot is not as original as it was in the first one, however. In Book 1, the nosy Duchess Wigtower almost discovers Princess Magnolia's double life. In this one, it's one of her party guests, Princess Sneezewort. But there's plenty to enjoy in LeUyen Pham's colorful illustrations, including the array of diverse, decked-out princesses and the different monsters' approaches to eating goats -- between giant pieces of bread in a sandwich, in a giant bun like a hot dog, and stuffed in a giant ice cream cone. And it's clever how increasingly tired and disheveled the Princess in Black looks as the day goes on.
The one twist is a monster giving her jewels when he finds out it's her birthday -- and her in turn giving them to her guests who've been waiting so long.","Parents need to know that The Princess in Black and the Perfect Princess Party is the second in the Princess in Black chapter book series by Shannon Hale and Dean Hale and illustrated by LeUyen Pham, but it easily works as a standalone. Book 1 introduced Princess Magnolia, who leads a double life, bravely -- and secretly -- sending goat-eating monsters back underground to Monster Land after her glitter-stone ring sounds the alarm. In this story, she's repeatedly summoned, causing repeated delays in opening presents at her birthday party.

Return to Augie Hobble,"Strange, sad, and surprisingly sweet story of friendship.","Augie Hobble is spending his summer working with his family at Fairy Tale Place, their down-at-the-heels amusement park in New Mexico. He failed Creative Arts and has to redo his project, but he’s struggling to come up with a good idea. Bullies won’t leave him alone. And after a creepy encounter with a big bad wolf, Augie isn’t sure if the hair sprouting on his body means he’s turning into a werewolf or just going through puberty. When a shocking event completely turns his world inside out, Augie’s world goes black. He’ll need to feel his way out, with courage and the help of a good friend. ","After an understated start, this odd, dark tale sneaks up on you and hooks your heart. Bullying, friendship, loneliness, and loss are explored against an unnerving backdrop of the paranormal: werewolves, ghosts, clairvoyants, even Bigfoot. With RETURN TO AUGIE HOBBLE, author Lane Smith -- best known for his work as an illustrator -- takes a lot of risks, and most of them pay off. The story is slow to come into focus: This heightens the emotional punch of an unexpected dramatic turn more than halfway through, but some readers may find the start too slow or surreal. Gentle humor and Augie’s muted optimism help keep things lighthearted.
There’s plenty of Smith’s visual artistry here, too: Illustrations, mostly in the form of pages from Augie’s journal, are key to the telling of this surprising story.","Parents need to know that Return to Augie Hobble is a sweet but dark story that gets into intense emotional territory. It’s the first novel from acclaimed illustrator and author Lane Smith (Abe Lincoln’s Dream), and it makes clever use of illustrations to tell its strange story. There are a lot of supernatural elements and some violent scenes, including an attack by an apparent werewolf and dream sequences about werewolves. Spoiler alert: A central character dies as a result of a peanut allergy, and a friend believes he’s to blame. These dark notes, and the emotional intensity, might be a lot for some 8-year-olds to process, so we recommend this for a slightly older audience than the publisher advises.

"Lyonesse, Book 1: The Well Between the Worlds","Brilliant, exciting industrial/Arthurian mashup.","In the strange world of Lyonesse, monsters are fished up from wells that lead to another world, then cut up and burned to provide the intense heat needed for various medieval industries. Idris Limpet, son of a fisherman and falsely accused of being part monster, is rescued from execution by Ambrose, a powerful magician. While being trained as a Monstergroom, he learns about the political struggle between captains and knights, the evil Regent and her noxious son, the destruction of the land through sinking and poison, and his own strange destiny. Includes map and Author's Note.
","This brilliant and utterly engrossing fantasy is a unique rethinking of Arthurian and Celtic legends, set in a mashup of medieval and industrial-age worlds that offers commentary on our own. Each of these four elements is exceptionally well-done. As a fantasy-adventure it is both exciting and satisfying, though those who don't like unresolved endings may want to wait until the next volume is released before reading this one. As a sort of warped retelling of the story of King Arthur, it is completely original, and Arthur fans will have fun finding the altered forms of the various characters and events.
	The combination of a Middle Ages setting with an industrial complex fueled by slicing up and burning intelligent telepathic creatures from another world introduces in the grittiest possible way the kinds of ethical dilemmas that usually lead to corruption of both government and soul. And finally, all of this, along with the sinking and poisoning of Lyonesse caused by the industries related to capturing the creatures and using them as fuel, has obvious parallels to problems we face today, though mercifully the author avoids getting at all didactic or preachy. From King Arthur to the effects of industrialization -- it's quite a ride.
 From the Book:
	Drowning was not at all what he had expected. He had assumed that when you fell into water you would sink, and the air in your chest would keep you going for a bit, but only until you got that panicky feeling you get when you hold your breath for too long in a breath- holding contest, after which you would take a gasp, which would not be of air but of water so you would sort of strangle. Then the horrible bit would start, with your life passing before your eyes and a very nasty struggle, the kind a caught fish makes in the basket.
	There was the smash of the water. There was the panicky feeling. And a question: Why don't we learn to swim, like the seals or the fish?
	And an answer: Because what swims is beast, monster, or Cross.","Parents need to know that there is some violence here, against adults, children, and monsters, some of whom are injured and killed.

The Orphan of Awkward Falls,"Girl fights to save friend in creepy, comic horror tale.","When Josephine moves to Awkward Falls she is immediately intrigued by the gloomy town's mystery. Who is the striking couple in the old photograph she finds in her bedroom? What's going on in the mansion next door? Her curiosity leads her to Thaddeus, a cloned genius who lives on hot chocolate and candy while performing operations on dead pets to bring them back to life with spare animal parts. When a murderer escapes the town's Asylum for the Dangerously Insane, it's Thaddeus he's after, and it's up to Josephine to save him.
","Josephine is likable, and the contrast of Thaddeus's scientific intelligence with his naiveté is funny. The town of Awkward Falls, with its sauerkraut festival and oddball residents, is another source of humor. However, as is often the problem with comical novels of this sort, none of the characters seems real enough to be fully engaging, and the illustrations, meant to add interest and a layer of gothic horror, are often so dark that it's difficult to discern their details. Still, the mystery of Thaddeus' background is intriguing, and deliciously creepy events unfold at an exciting clip as Josephine puts the clues together. The combat between idiot murderer, strange monsters, and clever children is particularly satisfying. Though it's by no means innovative, the book may appeal to fans of Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events or Mayrose Wood's The Incorrigible Children of Ashton Place.","Parents need to know that this comic gothic tale features an insane murderer who eats his victims, laboratory-manufactured monsters, and adults who are not very smart. However, the scariness is underscored with humor, and readers experienced with the dark wit of Lemony Snicket will understand that the main characters are not in any fatal danger.

My Soul to Take,"Not literary, but fun teen fantasy (and plenty of romance).","It's a crazy four days for Kaylee. Pretty girls keep dropping dead around her for no apparent cause -- and she is able to predict their untimely deaths just before they happen. Luckily good lookin' Nash has an explanation about what's really happening and some ideas for how to stop it. He also has a voice that seems to calm her -- and some hot kisses to keep her distracted.
","Well, this is certainly not going to meet anyone's definition of a classic, but it is good fun. There are mythical creatures, a dark mystery, a romance, and even some humor along the way  (""Minions!"" Thinks Kaylee during her final face off  with a grim reaper ""She did not just call me a minion!"").  Readers may be surprised that Kaylee can process so much in just four days -- from finding out she's not human to hooking up with her first boyfriend (not to mention discovering  why all the pretty girls around her keep dropping dead for no reason).  But those who love a fast-paced fantasy novel will keep up with this plot-heavy book -- the first in a series -- and eagerly await the next installment about the feisty heroine. ","Parents need to know that this book features both fantastical creature and murders, though violence is pretty limited. Kaylee has to deal with demons --  both real ones and symbolic ones (like accepting that her mother died so she can live).  Also, it is a Harlequin, so expect some romance (although, making out is as far as the main characters go). Some characters drink, and an adult gives her daughter sleeping pills that aren't prescribed to her. In the end, though, the heroine is a strong character who fights for those she loves.

The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,Twain's classic is full of humor and suspense.,"Mark Twain's classic novel THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER takes place in fictional St. Petersburg (a town on the Mississippi that is patterned after Twain's hometown of Hannibal, MO), where Tom lives with his Aunt Polly and cousins Sid and Mary. A mischievous, imaginative boy of about 11, Tom is often on the wrong side of the rules at school and at home. Late one night, Tom sneaks out with his friend Huckleberry Finn, and the two witness a violent crime. Afraid for their own safety, Tom and Huck promise each other to keep the night a secret, and Tom carries on his usual activities: playing pirates with his friends, flirting with the pretty Becky Thatcher, and worrying his Aunt Polly. But Tom and Huck soon find themselves in serious trouble, because they can't ignore their consciences, or the fact that the criminal has some treasure they can't resist.
","The Adventures of Tom Sawyer has stood the test of time because Twain's perceptive and humorous portrayal of young boys is so perfect and so universal. Twain's sardonic wit keeps the proceedings from ever seeming precious or teachy; Tom is a realistic character who could exist in any time, and his story is full of engaging slapstick and suspense. Tom Sawyer may offend some readers because of the author's use of bigoted language, but as with Twain's masterpiece, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, readers should keep an open mind to understanding the difference between the worldview of the author, and that of his characters.","Parents need to know that Mark Twain's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is one of this great American author's best-loved novels. First published in 1876, it portrays childhood during the mid-19th century in an affectionate but realistic way; Twain's characters are full of wild ideas and antics that sometimes get them into trouble. Tom Sawyer is often avoided, and has at times been banned from schools, because of Twain's use of the ""N"" word (which appears several times) and his derogatory portrayal of Native Americans in the form of the dangerous villain Injun Joe. The novel is an extremely enjoyable one, however -- full of humor and suspense -- if readers accept that the book's outdated, unfortunate portrayal of people of color is more a function of the characters' views than the author's.

"Worlds Apart: Story Thieves, Book 5","Wild adventures, cameos, recaps in loony series finale.","Things were already looking pretty bad at the end of Book 4, when arch-villain Nobody finally succeeded in tearing the real and fictional WORLDS APART -- in the process splitting half-real, half-fictional Bethany in two. At first, the two Bethanys are gleeful at losing their other halves, but things start going off the rails fast. Meanwhile, Owen's fictional, world-hopping pal Kara Dox seeks him out with an urgent message: Unless he can get the two worlds back together, he's doomed to an early death. Oh, and at least one world will be destroyed also. Could things possibly get worse? Apparently, and often. Nearly all characters from past adventures make at least a cameo appearance, often ill-timed, as the cosmic showdown with Nobody looms.
","If you've gotten this far in James Riley's wacky adventure series, you'll be right at home with the weird plot twists, random character appearances, shape-shifting, and tween angst. In Worlds Apart, tween heroes Owen and Bethany, along with their fictional-hero friends, are appealing and relatable as they try to do the right thing, save their worlds, and have more cool adventures.","Parents need to know that the hefty Worlds Apart concludes James Riley's crazily imaginative Story Thieves series involving the ""real"" world, the fictional world, and the bad things that happen when the two are on the outs. As earlier in the series, there's a lot of slapstick comic book violence, from the destruction of entire civilizations to bashing people with assorted weapons or hacking off instantly regrowing limbs. Tween characters have crushes and relationship misunderstandings with other tweens. As you might suspect from the follow-up to a Pick the Plot book, things don't necessarily make a lot of sense here. But amid the looniness and random appearances of past characters, there's a lot of positive messaging about friendship, family, courage, creative thinking, and the right balance between practicality and the imagination.

Lovable Lyle,Gentle story with a point to make.,"Sure, Lyle Crocodile lives with humans in the city. But when he begins to get hate mail, despite a lovable and benign nature, he is dumbstruck. Mrs. Primm finds the culprit, but prejudice is harder to overcome. This is a gentle junior-allegory with a point to make.
 ","A valuable lesson is presented here about the way to deal with prejudice, however irrational, especially in adults. Clearly, Lyle is the most lovable crocodile in the world, as any kid will tell you. And in this story, perplexed by the hate mail, he tries even harder to be sweet. Most interesting, it becomes clear that the problem lies with a mother who doesn't want her daughter to play with crocodiles, and says that ""nice neighborhoods"" don't allow them.
Bernard Waber keeps these complex issues child-friendly, and opens the discussion up for parents of kids who get it, but who aren't yet ready for more overt books about prejudice. Confusing the issue, though, is the fact that it is perfectly reasonable for a good mother to prevent her child from playing with a crocodile. Also, Waber again (as in Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile) resorts to the plot device of a melodramatic rescue to resolve the problem -- not a practical example to follow.","Parents need to know that a valuable lesson is presented here about dealing with prejudice.

The island's sole occupant, the Raxter School for Girls, has been quarantined by the government and only a small group of girls, one teacher, and the headmistress are still alive. All of the survivors bear terrible scars from the Tox, and relapses (often fatal) are common. To protect themselves from dangers known and unknown, the girls learn how to shoot, and when on Gun Shift, stand guard on the school roof. Because of the quarantine, they've been forbidden to go outside of the fence surrounding the school. Only the Boat Shift, girls who pick up supplies left by the Navy, have permission to venture out. This is a dangerous task, as the woods around the school are now filled with animals the Tox has transformed into bloodthirsty beasts who've attacked and killed students. Like everyone at the school, 16-year-old best friends Hetty (a scholarship student) and Byatt (a rich kid from Boston) and their roommate, Reece (daughter of the school's groundskeeper), are waiting for the cure promised by the government. But that's never come and the food and supplies left by the Navy are barely enough to keep them alive.  When Hetty is assigned to the Boat Shift, she discovers that all is not as it seems on the island. Then, Byatt falls ill and disappears from the school's infirmary.
","The violence in this often-grisly dystopian novel never overshadows the core of its compelling story of girls unprepared for an almost apocalyptic event who band together to create a new society. A society in which they must be caring and supportive and also make unimaginable choices about life and death for some of their own.

Told in alternating chapters by 16-year-old best friends, Hetty and Byatt, the story is often violent and graphically recounted. Girls use rifles, pistols, and knives to protect themselves from the island's Tox-stricken and blood thirsty animals, and sometimes even each other.

Two girls realize they've fallen in love with each other but go no further than kissing, and there are a few uses of profanity (""f--k,"" ""s--t,"", ""Jesus,"" and ""goddamn"").

Then there is the suspicious new therapist digging into Nora's life. When a homeless person is murdered while wearing Nora's coat and her bedroom is ransacked, the danger escalates, but Nora can't avoid the feelings she has for Patch. As she learns more about fallen angels and a deviant race called the Nephilim, she gets closer to Patch and to unravelling the mystery.
","It's oh, so promising on the outside and so disappointingly creepy and confusing on the inside. It contains Bible verses, quotes from esoteric religious texts, angels lusting after human females, and lots of violence mar this supernatural story. There are numerous plot points borrowed from Twilight, but much more violence -- and Nora has none of Bella's intelligence. Her great romance with Patch is marred by his repeated admissions of lust for her and other human girls in his past. He wants dearly to become human, but we are never sure why, other than to have sex with them. There are many opportunities to offend readers, and at the least to confuse the heck out of them, even readers familiar with the more standard lore of the orders of angels.

","Parents need to know that in this story focuses on an otherwise good boy who succumbs to temptation, spies on people, and even commits murder but reforms.

Peterrific,Brother of Pinkalicious builds tower in quirky adventure.,"In PETERRIFIC, Pikalicious' little brother finally gets his own story instead of being a helper in hers. He decides to build a giant tower out of blocks so high he can ""get a star from the sky and give it to Mommy."" He claims he wants to build it ""all by myself,"" but Pinkalicious helps him and borrows more blocks from a neighbor. Peter ends up stopping once he gets close to the moon and remembers that he's ""all alone"" and it's dark and cold and he's hungry. But he spends the night up there nd in the morning makes a parachute ouf of blankets and floats back down to his yard, where his parents and Pinkalicious are waiting. He doesn't get in trouble. In fact his dad encourages him to build another tower after he redesigns it. ""Your next tower should be a little smaller and safer, and you will definitely need a proper way to get down,"" says Mommy.
","It's nice for Peter to get his own picture book, but this story has a few things that don't add up. Peterrific, like the Pinkalicious books, mixes everyday kid behavior with fantasy elements to create an appealing story. But this one's a bit odd, with mixed messages about doing something ""all by myself"" but getting help nd fearlessly completing a great engineering feat -- building a tower to the stars out of blocks -- but facing no consequences, neither injury nor punishment for going rogue and doing something risky. It's a puzzling adventure, but kids will probably enjoy Peter's skill and enthusiasm, the colorful building project, and the sweet sibling bond, and they'll absorb the cautionary message that when you choose to do something lone, you could end up feeling lonely. ","Families need to know that Peterrific is a spin-off of Victoria Kahn's Pinkalicious series that stars Peter, the younger brother of Pinkalicious. Here Peter decides to build a giant tower to the stars ""all by myself"" but gets some kind help from Pinkalicious. His tower goes as high as the moon, but then he feels lonely and hungry and there's no way for him to get down. After spending a cold night lone in the sky atop his tower, he figures out how to make a parachute out of blankets and floats back to his front yard, where his family is waiting. He doesn't get in trouble. In fact his parents encourage him to redesign and rebuild his tower. His next design includes a slide to come down on.

The Slither Sisters: Tales from Lovecraft Middle School #2,Goofy comedy for young boys riffs on horror cliches.,"Fresh from saving their school from a demonic teacher, Robert Arthur and former bully Glenn Torkells must contend with twin sisters who are actually snake-headed monsters from another dimension. The girls plan to win the student council race and then abduct the entire seventh grade. Aided by a ghostly girl and a two-headed rat, Robert and Arthur must find a way to upset the election without winding up captured by extradimensional monstrosities.
","THE SLITHER SISTERS: TALES FROM LOVECRAFT MIDDLE SCHOOL #2 matches the good-natured, horror comedy of the series' first volume. Robert and his former nemesis Glenn are a winning team, and their battles with creatures from horror fiction and mythology are action-packed and funny.
Some readers may wonder, however, whether the series will build into something more than just a chain of encounters with bizarre monsters. It would be good to see author Charles Gilman up the stakes in the next volume.","Parents need to know that The Slither Sisters is a goofy horror comedy that picks up right where the first book in the series, Professor Gargoyle, left off. There are in-jokes for readers familiar with Greek mythology and the writing of H.P. Lovecraft, and no objectionable language or bloody violence, but there are attacks by snakes, demons, and a harpy. The mayhem is cartoonish and intended to be comic.

Confessions of an Imaginary Friend: A Memoir by Jacques Papier,"Whimsical, breezy faux memoir told by an imaginary friend.","CONFESSIONS OF AN IMAGINARY FRIEND: A MEMOIR BY JACQUES PAPIER is a tale told by a character who's a figment of a girl's imagination. At first he thinks he's her twin nd therefore real, so when evidence to the contrary starts accumulating, he's baffled. When Jacques finally understands, he gets upset, meets other imaginary friends at a meeting called Imaginaries Anonymous, and is assigned to work s an imaginary friend for a series of other kids, embarking on an emotional journey.
","There's lots to love in this highly fanciful, sometimes adult and sophisticated book narrated by an imaginary friend who struggles with the realization that he's not real. Jacques feels invisible and unseen -- because he is! Jacques' emotional journey takes him through friendships with other imaginary friends nd stints working as an imaginary friend for several kids.
There are references throughout that are beyond the experience of middle-grade readers: nonymous support group meetings, accountants, defibrillators, bucket lists, and various abstractions -- for instance, a pancake shaped like a Mozart symphony. But kids will relate to the feeling of being unseen, of being last to be picked for the kickball team, nd ignored at the lunch table. The premise is exceedingly clever, and the abundant whimsy and breezy humor add to the fun of viewing life through the eyes of someone who's imaginary. ","Parents need to know that Confessions of an Imaginary Friend, which bills itself in the subtitle s A Memoir by Jacques Papier as told to author Michelle Cuevas, is a faux memoir in the first-person voice of an imaginary friend. The twist is that Jacques thinks he's a real boy, a twin instead of an imaginary friend, and it's tough for him when he finally acknowledges the truth. Over the course of the story, he meets a host of other fanciful characters in Imaginaries Anonymous, a support group for imaginary friends, and serves as a helpful and supportive imaginary friend for a string of different kids. The tone's a bit adult, and many of the references are fairly sophisticated, likely to fly over the heads of middle-grade readers. But the core idea of a character who feels invisible is highly relatable.

The Worst Witch at School,Too young for Harry? Try this fun witch series.,"Mildred Hubble is excited about her first year of witch school, but soon discovers the lessons to be more challenging than expected -- making mistakes and getting into trouble seem to come easier to her than making the grade. But when she find out that rogue witches are plotting against the school, Mildred may just manage to save the day.
","This makes a great read-alone or read-aloud for pre-Potter kids; the author's great characters and worthwhile lessons are ideal for this age group.
Mildred Hubble is your average, awkward, school-age kid who has adventures with her friends, but also faces challenges. Kids will find her a relatable character right away (with the added fun that she's a witch), and will enjoy her unique friends Maud and Enid. Maud wears glasses, is short and stocky, and tends to play it safe. Enid is tall and big-boned, also awkward, and likes mischief.
First published in 1974 when the author was just 18 years old, it's since been adapted as a movie and TV series.","Parents need to know that this book comprises two titles in the Worst Witch series: The Worst Witch and The Worst Witch Strikes Again. It's a great precursor for readers not ready for the Harry Potter series mixing friendship, adventures, and fantasy. The accident-prone but likeable Mildred Hubble experiences a series of mishaps in witch school causing her humiliation, fear (not much), and frustration. Children fall from broomsticks, are turned into animals by the wrong spells, and are threatened by a band of misfit witches.

The Straight Road to Kylie,Racy gay-themed read is fun but contrived.,"Jonathan knows he's gay, but he agrees to pose as the boyfriend of a popular rich girl when she bribes him with a chance to see his favorite pop star in concert: Kylie Minogue. But after fighting with friends -- and falling for a cute boy -- he begins to wonder if he made the right choice.
","The premise is fun but farfetched: A popular girl bribes a gay boy to be her boyfriend, hoping to maintain her social status ""by dating the newest, hottest guy on the market."" Readers willing to accept it will get drawn into energetic Jonathan's often wacky suburban life. Outrageous characters breathe life into this story -- like his bisexual best friend Carrie, who introduces herself by slapping his booty and shouting, ""Oh, baby is this seat taken?!"" Readers will have some good laughs along the way (at a Halloween party, for example, he dresses in a Madonna combat costume, but tells his fake girlfriend that he is dressed as an Italian GI Joe).
Be warned: There is lots of mature material -- drinking, swearing, sex -- and the plot follows a predictable path. In the end, Jonathan learns that he can't just play it straight -- he also needs to meet other gay guys, including a first boyfriend.","Parents need to know that this book features a gay protagonist who ultimately meets his first boyfriend. Along the way, he has sex with a girl, makes out with a bartender, and dares two girls to kiss. There's also plenty of underage drinking -- at the beginning of the book, Jonathan even has sex when he's drunk -- along with some swearing, and mentions of chain stores and fast food outlets.

The Tequila Worm,Moving tale of Latina going to white boarding school.,"A fictionalized memoir of growing up in the warm embrace of the Mexican-American barrio of McAllen, Texas. For Sofia the center of her life is her extended family and her comadres, the girls who will become her lifelong ... well, friends seems too pale a word for this intense, mutually supportive relationship.
But Sofia has dreams beyond the barrio, and a pivotal event in her childhood gives her the drive to achieve them. When she wins a scholarship to an Episcopal boarding school hundreds of miles away, her family is reluctant to let her go and determined to keep her tied firmly to her roots when she does.
","First-time novelist Viola Canales has accomplished what few before her have managed: to create a realistic, but not didactic, portrait of life within a particular culture. In this case, it's the Mexican-American culture in Texas. Canales' depiction will resonate with readers from within and without that culture. The details of foods, traditions, rituals, and clothing are warm, rich, loving, and so integrated into the daily life and mindset of all the characters that it creates a yearning in the reader to experience it firsthand.
When Sofia steps out of her community into one very alien to her -- a mostly white Protestant boarding school -- she neither loses touch with her home and culture nor feels like an outsider in her new setting. While she faces some prejudice in her new school, she also finds support, close friends, and a superb education while remaining true to herself. This is a lovely, moving, warmhearted story that lingers long after the last page.","Parents need to know that The Tequila Worm is the moving fictionalized memoir of a Mexican-American girl from the barrio in McAllen, Texas, who enters  mostly white Protestant boarding school hundreds of miles from home but stays connected to her family.

Join the determined Mouton and her friends, Canard the duck and Cocorico the nervous and doubtful rooster, on their history-making hot-air-balloon flight. This one-of-a-kind story of a dream fulfilled has kids wanting to hear it again and again.
 ","Part of this book's charm is its surprise ending. At the back of the book, a historical note reveals that MOUTON'S IMPOSSIBLE DREAM is based on the true story of the world's first ""passengered"" flight of 1783, in which a sheep, a duck, and a rooster flew in a hot-air balloon in Paris.
The author adds a delightful bit of imagination, emotion, and charm to the story and illustrations. Flights of fancy themselves, the illustrations are bright, colorful images that fill the pages. Perspectives vary from ground level to bird's-eye views, and just about everything in between -- including a delightful knee-high view of the king and queen from the animals' perspective and a dreamy representation of Mouton in flight that will make readers feel as if they're flying through the clouds right alongside her.

Learning Not to Drown,Teen faces her criminal brother's legacy in gripping read.,"LEARNING NOT TO DROWN tells the story of Clare Tovin and her dysfunctional family. Even though Clare's brother Luke has been in and out of jail for most of her life, he's good to her and she idolizes him. Because of Luke's run-ins with the law, the Tovin family is not always embraced in their small town. The book opens with Clare's vague flashback of discovering an altercation in her home; from there the action alternates between 17-year-old Clare's current life and flashbacks to her early family memories. As the recollections eventually catch up to present time, Clare's memories become clearer, allowing her to connect the dots of the her brother's troubles with the law and the ways in which her family has -- and hasn't -- dealt with them. Along the way, we meet Skeleton, the taunting, goading specter Clare sees whenever her family's troubles interfere with her life and happiness.
","In her debut novel, Anna Shinoda creates  gripping, realistic tale of living with the fallout of a relative's crimes and of the stigma that comes with being associated with a criminal. The story's told from Clare's point of view, and at first she is whiny and grating. But as she faces her family's secrets and learns to advocate for herself, her tone becomes more assured. It's enjoyable to watch her mature over the course of the book. Learning Not to Drown's structure of alternating between past and present builds interest and moves the story forward in a compelling way. 
Clare's life is frustrating, and she gets no support at home, but the overall message is good: You can't change people, but you can take care of yourself and build a good support system outside of your family. The lurking character of Skeleton, a representation of Clare's embarrassment over her family, is a clever device. He taunts Clare, but she eventually learns to face him and deal with his near-constant presence. Clare's parents are infuriating characters, and her dad's role is somewhat confusing and poorly fleshed out. The story would have benefited from further exploration of their relationship and his motivations.","Parents need to know that Learning Not to Drown details the ways in which one person's demons can cause a serious ripple effect through the lives of the people around him. Clare Tovin is a smart, self-reliant teenager whose brother Luke has been in and out of jail most of her life. This causes many people in her small town to whisper and judge the Tovin family. Although Clare idolizes Luke, she comes to learn the reality of his crimes and her parents' enabling behavior toward him. Characters, including teens, drink, smoke, and use drugs. There are several violent altercations, and a character is accused and convicted of rape. Characters use strong language, including ""f--k"" and its variations and ""s--t"" and its variations.

Robot Zot!,Energetic read that some parents may find too violent.,"Robot Zot crashes onto Earth, intent on defeating the planet: “Robot Zot! Wham Bot!” He bravely stomps off into an ordinary home, seeing danger in every direction and blasting away at appliances. Until he sees what he believes must be the Queen of all Earth -- a toy phone. Rescuing her is the greatest challenge he’s faced yet, but Robot Zot sets aside his fears and becomes Hero Zot.
","Parents who are trying to keep violence- and gun-free homes will want to give this one a wide berth. The gleeful, blast-‘em-up ethos will rightly give many other parents pause -- this pushes the envelope even for 5-year-olds, and it goes too far for younger kids in the publisher's recommended reading range of 3- to 7-year-olds. But older kids who delight in rambunctious, imaginative play will be delighted to find a book to match their energy level. And if you can get them to sit still a few minutes after reading it, you may be able to talk together about the folly of Zott’s aggressive, button-thumping approach.
Jon Scieszka’s robotic text sets the stage for David Shannon’s joke-filled illustrations. Kids will delight in seeing the clueless adult trying to make sense of the wreckage done by Zot, and the ferocity on Zot’s face as he confronts harmless kitchen appliances.
The animated illustrations tell the real story of the exploits of Robot Zot, who is a legend in his own mind. Background details reward close viewing.","Parents need to know there’s abundant mayhem in this lively, action-packed adventure. Robot Zot sets off with his blaster to conquer Earth, where every mundane object he encounters -- a TV, a toaster, a blender -- seems to be a dangerous enemy.

"Prince Caspian: The Chronicles of Narnia, Book 2","Exciting, more straightforward Narnia sequel.","The four Pevensie children from The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe are called back to Narnia when Caspian, the nephew of the evil usurping ruler, sides with the true Narnians to oppose him. There they find that centuries have passed since their last visit, and that, once again, they face a battle against overwhelming odds.
","PRINCE CASPIAN is an altogether simpler and more straightforward adventure tale than its predecessor, and far simpler than most modern fantasies. Once again Lucy is the heroine of heart and spirit, while Peter is the hero of the sword. Edmund has learned his lessons well, and is stalwart and kind, while Susan -- well, Susan mostly grumbles, and one can see Lewis already setting up her fall from grace, which occurs in the last book. The novel is structured as two parallel, and eventually intersecting, stories: one of Caspian escaping from, and rebelling against, his evil uncle; the other of the Pevensies rediscovering a Narnia that has changed a great deal in the centuries since their last visit.
Gone, for the most part, is the heavy dose of Christian symbolism, replaced by a hodgepodge of mythological elements, including Bacchus and his Maenads, nature spirits, and a river god. The plain but very literary writing and simplicity of storytelling, combined exciting adventures and a moderate length make this book well-suited to middle-grade readers.","Parents need to know that there is some violence here, with battles and beheadings with swords.

Her Grandpa comes for a visit, bringing a ""cheering-up present."" The present is a photo album of pictures of Baby Duck when she was younger, including pictures of her first steps, her first birthday party, and her first ride in a wagon. Sitting on Grandpa's lap, Baby Duck thoroughly enjoys the visit and the book. Feeling better, she hops out of Grandpa's lap and draws a picture of the two of them for him.
","Baby Duck has the sort of life that we would all like for our young children; her world is safe and orderly yet stimulating, and she is loved by everyone around her. Her story is written for preschool-age children with an emphasis on their interests and concerns. While the story is quite simple, the characters and details seem authentic. For example, when baby Duck decides to draw a picture, she slides off of the chair. That is just what a tiny child must do because the floor is far below.
Using only dots for eyes and the requisite duck bills for mouths, the illustrator successfully imbues the faces of the characters with a full range of emotions. In addition, the pastel-shade watercolor art is carefully rendered and cheerful. Young children will identify with and enjoy the quiet day with Baby Duck and her Grandpa.","Parents need to know that this sixth story about Baby Duck is just as sweet as the others.

Twelve-year-old Hillary, a loner whose family frequently moves, is realistically and sympathetically presented.
 ","Hillary's way of coping -- creating a fantasy experiment -- allows her to maintain an emotional distance from her own life, and to make some pretty sharp observations of both her parents and peers. She is quickly able to get beyond the stereotypes of the popular girl and the angry outsider to see the complex humanity in each.
Hillary's alien-observation fantasy may be off-putting for some readers, though she clearly abandons the pretense by story's end. When she tells her new friend Cass about it and asks, ""Do you think I was crazy?""

Madeline and the Gypsies,"Not the best in the series, but still a favorite.","A gypsy carnival and a sudden storm provide little schoolgirl Madeline and her friend, Pepito, a chance to experience gypsy life, which most readers will think looks like a lot of fun. The illustrations of horses, elephants, and bright-colored gypsy clothing are inviting, yet when a gypsy woman tries to keep them from Miss Clavel, young readers could be frightened.
 ","Kids will enjoy the story and colorful artwork, though adults may find the plot and rhyme less than perfect. Bemelmans makes some awkward word choices, such as shirty to rhyme with dirty. And the plot plays on the stereotype of gypsies stealing children, and it's especially frightening when the two are sewed up inside a lion's costume to keep Miss Clavel from finding them.
In this tale, Madeline and Pepito get to experience the gypsy life, learn some tricks, and, best of all, ""never have to brush your teeth, and never-never to go to sleep."" Ludwig Bemelmans's artwork is fanciful, with more color and chaos than usual, evoking the style of the gypsies. A particularly lovely night scene illustrates the outside of Mont Saint-Michel, and a busy train-station scene accompanies a reassuring verse about coming home after a journey.
 ","Parents need to know that while gypsy life seems fun, children may worry about the characters' safety. The art conveys the excitement of the circus. However, the story and verse are not Bemelmans's best.

Shooting Kabul,Life and 9/11 through lens of 11-year-old Afghan immigrant.,"Because the Taliban have become oppressive, especially to women and Afghans who were educated in the United States, 11-year-old Fadi and his family are forced to flee Afghanistan just months before the 9/11 attacks. In the middle of the night, as they are running to the truck that is to take them across the border to Peshawar in Pakistan, they lose their 6-year-old daughter, Mariam. Distraught and guilt-ridden, they nevertheless must emigrate without her to Fremont, CA, where life is very difficult for them and becomes worse after the 9/11 attacks. Family members already in Fremont help them out as they adjust to life in the U.S. and continue their search for Mariam.
The story is told from Fadi's point of view. He misses his sister, and feels that he has let his family down. On top of that, he struggles not only with the normal difficulties of fitting into middle school, but also with the prejudice often shown toward any immigrant, especially Muslims, after the 9/11/2001 attacks. A sensitive teacher, a good friend, and a photography contest all help Fadi cope and work to reunite the family.

The hopeful message is that he finds solace and hope in his family and good friends as well as in his photography, and he makes honorable choices even in the most rugged situations.

People and peculiars are not always who they seem, and several unexpected twists lead to an epic battle in the Library of Souls nd the final resolution of Jacob and Emma's story. ","Action-packed and accented by strange photos, this final book in Ransom Riggs' gothic thriller trilogy is complicated, spine-tingling, violent, and romantic. It's also well written and fun to read. The war between good and evil is the stuff comic books are made of, the vocabulary reads like a classic novel, and the unique story will engage anyone who loves science fiction, dystopian novels, and/or cannibalistic monsters, evil scientists, and heroes with superhuman talents. Some readers may find the first part slow going as Riggs sets up pieces of a complicated plot. However, midway, the action and excitement pick up, and those pieces fall into place. Battles ensue, death and destruction are narrowly avoided, happy surprises follow hopeless disasters, and vice versa. Good is bad and bad is good s the story twists and turns through loops, tunnels, turrets, sewage-laden canals, and fantastical rooms and worlds on its way to a final resolution. Whew! What a journey! Definitely one readers will not soon forget. ","Parents need to know that Library of Souls, the final thriller in Ransom Riggs' gothic trilogy, completes the heroic adventures of Jacob and Emma as they try to rescue their friends, the world of the peculiars, and their budding teen romance. It should be read after the other two books (Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, Hollow City). The story is clever, adventurous and tense nd accented with bizarre photos, as are the others. It's a basic good-vs.-evil story with a few unexpected twists and turns, packed with violence, monsters, evil characters, drug-crazed simpletons as well as some kissing and yearning. Director Tim Burton's film adaptation of Book 1 is set for a March 2016 release.

A List of Cages,"Dark, moving foster-kid story shows power of friendship.","A LIST OF CAGES depicts a rekindled friendship between two high school boys. Julian was a foster kid at Adam's house for a short time after Julian's parents died. When Julian's uncle becomes his guardian, the boys don't see each other for five years, until senior Adam is given the task of escorting freshman Julian to the school psychologist's office. Adam is the happy-go-lucky kid he's always been, a favorite of peers and adults alike. Julian still seems to be sweet and kind, but he is clearly withdrawn and troubled. He has no friends and hides out in a secret room at school. The story is told in alternating points of view between the two boys. Adam works hard to reconnect with Julian, eventually drawing him into his supportive circle of friends. When he starts to realize how terrible Julian's life has been, he's conflicted about whether to keep Julian's secret or get him help. Eventually things get dark and lives are on the line. The bonds of their friendship are tested, with the main question being: How much can you help someone who won't let you?
","With a story that alternates between grim and uplifting, this tale of a neglected foster child and his only friend will break your heart and give you hope. In A List of Cages, Julian and Adam are well-drawn, empathetic characters. Adam is lighthearted and kind but not shallow. He has deep reserves of empathy that make you immediately like him as a character. Julian's character is heartbreaking but sweet, and the loss and abuse he endures is almost too much to bear at times. The dark passages are balanced out by the kindness Adam and his friends show Julian and by scenes of teens interacting and having fun. The book realistically shows the snowball effect of abuse and neglect: In addition to destroying a kid's emotional well-being, it can affect him academically and socially, leaving him further isolated. Also realistic is Adam's struggle over his promise to keep Julian's secret and his wanting to help him.
The story is moving and gripping. Both kids grow a lot emotionally over the course of the book, and it's heartwarming to watch it happen. The writing, though, is uneven. It's lyrical in many parts but flat in others. Aside from Julian and Adam, most of the other characters are less well-developed and mostly serve as archetypes (the hot girl, the sweet girl, and so on). With the exception of the school psychologist, who is merely ineffective, the teachers and principal are too mean to Julian to be believable, given that they should have known of his dyslexia and foster situation. A confrontation toward the end of the book feels jammed into the story and over the top; it doesn't serve much purpose except to add more drama.","Parents need to know that A List of Cages is about two teen boys who meet up after five years apart. Julian's parents died when he was 9, and he spent a few months as a foster kid at Adam's house. When Julian's uncle becomes his guardian, the boys are separated. Adam, a senior in high school, takes freshman Julian under his wing when he discovers that Julian has no friends and is withdrawn and fearful. The novel realistically shows how easily foster kids slip through the cracks. Julian endures physical and mental abuse, some of which is depicted graphically and might be hard for sensitive readers to stomach. The long-term effects of such abuse is portrayed. Other parts of the book are more lighthearted, with Adam's good cheer buoying everyone around him. His character is an excellent role model for kindness and empathy. Dyslexia and ADHD figure into the story. High school seniors are depicted realistically: They joke around, flirt, worry about life after graduation, drink a little, swear (""f--k,"" ""s--t,"" ""a--hole""), and date. The drinking isn't glamorized, and Adam counsels Julian to drink only one beer. One teen lies to his mom about where he is on spring break, because he wants to take a trip with his girlfriend. There's some peer pressure, especially when the kids play the Game, which is just the ""dare"" part of Truth or Dare. A List of Cages has many positive messages about the power of caring and kindness and trying to look beyond the surface to see what people are going through.

"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea",Classic undersea adventure with science-fiction flair.,"Just after the American Civil War, French biologist Pierre Aronnax, accompanied by his faithful assistant Conseil, embark on a voyage in search of a mysterious creature that's been attacking ships around the world. In due course the creature proves to be a submarine, and he, Conseil, and French-Canadian harpooner Ned Land are taken captive by its master, the mysterious Captain Nemo. For many months the trio, prisoners aboard the Nautilus, behold undersea wonders from one end of the globe to another, while learning very little about what dark force drives their captor.
","Science-minded kids may love Professor Aronnax's tendency to describe every fish and plant he sees wherever he goes, and trivia-minded ones may love some of the historical tales on the side. Others may wish Verne would just get on with the story. One of the pioneering works of science fiction, 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, first published in 1870, is downright uncanny in the accuracy with which it predicted much technology to come, from submarines to electricity. With many versions in book and movie form over the years (including the 1954 Disney classic), it's become a cultural icon, as has its mysterious Captain Nemo; consider which version may be right for your kids.","Parents need to know that next to Agatha Christie, Jules Verne is the most translated author of all time, and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1870) is probably his most popular work -- which means you have versions galore to choose from, depending on your kid's age, interest level, and sensitivities, from full-length annotated versions to entry-level books that focus on the basic story. This unabridged version, translated from the French by Anthony Bonner, preserves Verne's 19th-century tendency to show off his knowledge on all subjects, so expect every plot development to be cause for a lecture on history or science. It also includes some violent scenes, especially of shipwrecks and their drowned victims, as well as a dramatic attack against a ship and its crew by a group of giant squid, which costs a crew member his life; another dies after an incident that isn't described. There's a good deal of violence against animals and butchery of sea creatures, as well. Mysterious Captain Nemo is driven by the need for revenge, but his motives are never fully explained.

The drama is at an all-time high after a series of texts jeopardizes her friendship with Brandon and her swimming class flop threatens her gym grade. Mean girl Mackenzie is up to her old tricks with Nikki in her sights, and, of course, Nikki has to babysit her impossible little sister. She's still a dork, but will that be enough to overcome So. Much. DRAMA?
","Tween girls rejoice: Another chapter in the popular Dork Diaries saga has arrived, and it's fluffy, funny, and light on content -- just the type of brain junk food kids love. Author Rachel Renee Russell is slowly maturing Nikki in the series, and in this installment it shows. There's less emphasis on materialism, and Nikki shows more redeeming qualities, such as her creativity and ability to think on her feet. However, the characters are still shallow and underdeveloped.

What Pet Should I Get?,More Seuss magic in discovered manuscript.,"In WHAT PET SHOULD I GET?, a young brother and sister -- the same two siblings from One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish -- finally have their parents' permission to get a pet. Their mission has two constraints: Choose one pet only, and be back home by noon. When they walk into the pet store, the number of fascinating pets available overwhelms them. What'll it be? A dog, a cat, a fish, or one of the other amazing Seuss-ian nimals? Each page complicates the situation as the kids weigh the pros and cons of each and try to decide on one -- the one that will fit best with their family. In the end, the kids head home, smiles on their faces and excitement in their eyes. The reader sees eyes peering out of the box the boy carries nd is left to decide which pet they're taking home. End notes by the publisher describe Dr. Seuss' love of animals, explain the creation of this book, and stress that shelters and rescue organizations are better places to look for your next pet than pet stores. ","This book is classic Dr. Seuss, from its jazzy rhymes and catchy refrain to its familiar yet unique characters and explosive script full of fun and adventure. It offers a valuable message about the challenges of decision-making, especially when choosing a pet for the family.
Though it could be argued that Seuss had not yet finished his manuscript, book notes at the end explain how well the editors knew Dr. Seuss and how careful they were to be true to his spirit when making changes, adding color, and so on. All in all, having one more Dr. Seuss book to treasure only makes the world a better place. ","Parents need to know that What Pet Should I Get? is a Dr. Seuss book filled with jazzy rhymes, familiar-yet-unique characters drawn with strong black lines and filled with primary colors, and a story kids will like. The manuscript was discovered among Seuss' papers in 2013, seemingly complete and previously unpublished. With light editing, it has been published 50 years after it was written. Though it may not quite measure up to Seuss classics such as The Cat in the Hat, Green Eggs and Ham, or Horton Hears a Who, the Seuss genius definitely fills each page with fun and silliness. The two main characters are the brother and sister from One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish, and the color palette is similar. Publisher's notes discuss Seuss' love of animals and explain how this book came to be. Several photos of Seuss and his pets also re included, as is a comment about adopting pets from shelters or rescue organizations. Great for beginning readers and book collectors alike.

"Cinders & Sapphires: At Somerton, Book 1",First in fun series is like a Downton Abbey for teens.,"When Ada returns with her family from India to England, her life changes dramatically: Not only does she meet (and kiss!) and Indian student she meets on the ship, but she's about to get a new stepfamily. As she prepares to enter Society, she must keep her romance a secret, especially from her conniving, competitive stepsister Charlotte. In the meantime, she strikes up a sort of friendship with her sweet maid Rose, even encouraging her to pursue her musical talents. But then one night she pushes Rose to make a decision that changes the young maid's life forever.
","Readers who like descriptions of English countryside manors, romance, fancy dresses, and conversations full of double meanings will find plenty to like in this breathless first installment. CINDERS & SAPPHIRES is a bit overstuffed with scandal, but the pronounced plotting will keep the pages turning -- and ensure that readers stay hungry for the next book in the series. While they're waiting for the publication of Book 2, teens will have plenty to talk and think about, including how much has changed since 1910 -- and how they would have fought for their own dreams in such a highly managed society. ","Parents need to know that there's a lot of romance in Cinders & Sapphires, which follows an upper-class English family at the turn of the 20th century, and even some stolen kisses. Ada falls in love with an Indian man studying at Oxford, her stepbrother is secretly gay and having a relationship with his valet, and Ada discovers her stepsister ""behaved ... indiscreetly"" with a lord. There are other scandals as well, including a blackmailing scorned lover and an accidental death. Beyond these salacious elements, main characters Rose and Ada are smart, kind women who understand the constraints of their class and gender, but try not to ""stifle the flame inside"" them that burns for a different life.

Fire,Stellar fantasy heroine in mature action-adventure/romance.,"In the Dells where the monsters live, every creature -- even human -- has a monster version: monster leopards, monster kittens, even a 17-year-old monster girl named Fire. Men desire her for her beauty, kings desire her for her ability to control minds. She lives a secluded life giving music lessons to children and thinks she's in love with her childhood best friend, Archer. But as war brews, young Prince Brigan arrives in Fire’s village to ask for her help. She travels with his army to the city of her birth, where life in the castle is full of both intrigue and beauty. Fire finds the royal family worthy of loyalty and risks her life to help them, but first she has to learn to use her ability to control minds -- and learn to trust herself.
","Elegant world-building creates a medieval fantasy full of mystery, romance, and complex characters with secrets that are slowly and carefully revealed. The main character is the most compelling, raising the bar for what makes the perfect heroine. Turning away from her monster heritage and living as a human -- and becoming embroiled in the moral obligations that come with that choice -- is just the beginning of her trials. And of course there's the heartbreak as well.
This is one of those books marketed to young adults that will also have a large adult readership due to the strong, heroic characters; beautiful imagery; and a setting in which women have many kinds of freedom and many kinds of power.","Parents need to know that this well-executed fantasy book contains some violence and other mature subject matter, including a young man who murders his father, (barely described) rapes, and unplanned pregnancies. Fire herself was fathered by a monster who raped her human mother -- and used mind control over the king to enjoy acts of cruelty and depravity. But Fire is a strong, brave heroine, and the main story is about how she overcomes her history and realizes that she can be the kind of person she longs to be.

What Is the Story of? Series,"Surprisingly deep, interesting look at beloved characters.","Related to the Who Is?, Where Is?, and What Is? series, the WHAT IS THE STORY OF? series gives readers a detailed look at some of the most beloved characters to captivate societies for decades. Longevity is key here; each book reviews the long history of the character in context with global events, technological breakthroughs, and social movements over decades. Each book has a bibliography and a fold-out, glossy timeline of events at the end, and sidebars throughout the book give details related to the main topic.
","Like the related series, this one is packed with details that go well beyond the focus of each book but stay grounded in the topic.

"Beautiful Chaos: Beautiful Creatures, Book 3","More black magic, less exciting action in third outing.","Ethan and Lena continue their romance in Book 3 of the popular Beautiful Creatures teen series. A plague has consumed Gatlin and the people who live there. The incubus Abraham Ravenwood and the Demon Queen, Sarafine, also remain as prominent evil-doers, wreaking havoc on everyone's lives. Ethan and Lena both struggle to understand her claiming as both a Light and Dark Caster and how her 18th birthday will affect the \""Order of Things\"" in the Mortal and Caster worlds.
","BEAUTIFUL CHAOS digs deeper into black magic, coincidences, and the Caster world. The characters continue to grow and learn how they can stop the Dark Casters before they destroy not only sleepy town of Gatlin, but the entire world. At first, kids may be entertained by the story, but might quickly become bored by this lengthy tome. The story isn't as exciting as the first book, which not only gave readers a fresh take on paramormal romance but also brought in themes of prejudice, bullying, and being an outcast, especially in high school. The characters are rarely at school. The history of the Civil War, which was an appealing part of the first book, is also missing from the pages of Beautiful Chaos. Some of the more fun chapters have the characters step into the Caster Tunnels, New Orleans, and back in school participating in normal activities, like sports and dances. At times Beautiful Chaos is too dark and brooding. Readers need a breather from the evil with some happiness and light. Unfortunately, Beautiful Chaos gives us neither.","Parents need to know that Beautiful Chaos is the third book in the popular Caster Chronicles fantasy series. It remains more ethereal in nature than some of the steamier paranormals for teens, but gets much darker in this installment. It deals with witchcraft, voodoo, necromancy, and fortune-telling.The main plot threads focus on the ""End of Days,"" which is plaguing Gatlin; how Lena's mother, Sarafine, became a Dark Caster; and Lena tring to understand her claiming as both a Light and Dark Caster and how her 18th birthday will affect the ""Order of Things"" in the Mortal and Caster worlds. There are mild swear words, property destruction, and hand-to-hand fighting.

The Best Thanksgiving Ever!,Simple story celebrates families coming together.,"A turkey family prepares their home for their annual Thanksgiving dinner.
","While this isn't a deep book or a particularly moving one, it’s a fun way to start discussion about your own Thanksgiving celebrations or the inevitable trials (and fun) of having visitors. Similar to what many kids will experience, the turkey family is crowded, busy, and alike but not alike (with their different hats, different expressions, and different ways of spending time before dinner). It's noisy, the baby is crying, there are hugs and kisses, and lots of stuff left to do even as the first visitors pull into the driveway.
Bright colors and cartoon-y pen-and-ink drawings effectively convey the craziness of large family gatherings. Kids will enjoy picking out the different characteristics of the turkeys (like Great-Uncle Dwight -- think his Elvis-like hairdo is actually a toupee?) and maybe even finding folks who match their own relatives. And have no fear, the turkeys aren't cannibals -- their Thanksgiving menu is centered around a big plate of corn on the cob.","Parents need to know that this is a simple story of a family of turkeys celebrating Thanksgiving. Nothing objectionable is presented.

"Tiger's Voyage: Tiger's Curse, Book 3",Tedious lovers' quarrels drag down intriguing fantasy.,"At the end of Book 2, Ren is saved from torture at the hands of the power-hungry Lokesh, but has lost all memory of Kelsey. He's even physically pained to be in the same room with her. Now Kelsey is very distraught but still determined to help Ren and his brother Kishan break the centuries-old curse that makes them live as tigers for part of each day. Mr. Kadam helps Kelsey unravel the next prophesy: They must face dragons in the Indian Ocean. So they head to their giant yacht, take some scuba diving lessons, and then slip into another realm where each dragon provides some major obstacles (some with big, big teeth) to recovering the next object that will help break the curse: Durga's lost necklace. Each task is made even harder to focus on as Kelsey's affections for Kishan grow. Now it's next to impossible for Kelsey to choose between the brothers without causing some serious heartbreak.
","OK, the dragons are pretty cool, especially since they're not your typical knight-fighting Western dragons. They're serpentine and colorful and exotic with devious personalities, and can even take human form. Almost as cool: Kelsey and her tigers travel to each of their domains on a luxurious yacht. Between each death-defying adventure there's time to rest in a bedroom suite and soak in the Jacuzzi.
	But those yachting breaks also allow for lots of lovers quarrels and jealous brother quarrels and Kelsey's wishy-washy emotional rollercoaster rides. It all pretends that readers hadn't been there, done that in the 900 pages combined of the first two books. Now you can add 500+ more pages to that. The time would have been much better spent fighting more cool dragons.","Parents need to know that this third book in the popular Tiger's Curse fantasy romance series has the same level of violence as Book 2, Tiger's Quest. More mystical creatures attack and cause serious injury to characters, but they are often healed by magical means. Now that both brothers are together in this book, there's more fighting for main character Kelsey's affections. She kisses both brothers and lets one sleep in her room, but it doesn't go further than that. Readers will learn quite a bit about scuba diving safety and the myths about underwater cities.

Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,A classic that both adults and kids love.,"What strange and marvelous creatures will Alice find down the rabbit hole, and what amazing thing will happen next? The inventive language and charming fantasy make this a classic that both adults and kids love. Older ones will appreciate the satire, but some younger children will be confused or bored. Updated illustrations are appealing to children.
","Though there are many video versions nd a lot of simplified retellings of this story, all kids deserve to know this wonderful adventure as Lewis Carroll wrote it. But it takes a particular kind of child to enjoy this: Complex language, nonsense, and the lack of a sensible plot are not to every child's taste. The book needs to be thoughtfully read aloud by an adult; few children will read this on their own. But, read aloud, the rhythmic poems can delight kids for their sounds and silly images.
The book works on two levels: as a delightful children's fantasy and as an impish poke in the eye to adults. Alice's strange new world remains just enough like the polite society of Victorian England that we can recognize it -- but it isn't terribly polite, allowing adults to understand much of the book as satire. Of course, kids usually don't see the satire; they simply enjoy the nonsense. If you've forgotten how to do that, Alice can help you remember.","Parents need to know that constantly changing predicaments, strange creatures, and the watercolors are very child-friendly. But difficult language, Carroll's nonsense poems, and adult humor will leave some children bored or confused. Still, it's a classic well worth the trouble nd particularly fun as a read-aloud.

Dope Sick,Cautionary tale about a teen drug addict.,"Jeremy, called Lil J, a teen addict, participates in a drug sale that goes bad when the buyer, an undercover cop, gets shot. Falsely blamed for the shooting, Jeremy goes into hiding in an abandoned building. There he meets Kelly, a mysterious guy sitting in one of the rooms with a tv and a remote control, which apparently allows him to see anywhere and anywhen. Showing Jeremy scenes from his own life, past, present, and future, he pushes Jeremy to confront honestly the decisions he has made and the paths he is taking.
","It's  short book (183 pages) almost entirely made up of two guys in a little room in an abandoned house -- talking; but it's hard to put down. Do you remember the movie 12 Angry Men? It was just some guys, in one small room, doing nothing but talking for 95 minutes, and yet you couldn't take your eyes off it. It didn't have any of the things we think a story needs -- romance, humor, action, movement -- just talk. But it was utterly compelling. DOPE SICK is like that, but with a touch of magic realism. 	Like 12 Angry Men, it's a bit didactic, and it doesn't matter. It's gritty, and, despite the touch of magic, doesn't shy away from reality, even to its ambiguous ending. With a rhythmic and seamless use of dialect, it examines issues that thousands of teens all over the country wrestle with every day. And, in doing so, it really has two messages. One, for the teens who can relate to Jeremy, says, ""There can be a way out."" The other speaks to those who don't have to deal with his problems, and who may be tempted to despise and dismiss those like him with little thought. It says, ""Here's how he got this way, and it could happen to anyone.""
 From the Book:
	My arm was hurting bad. Real bad. The bone could have been broken. I couldn't tell. I just knew it was hurting and swollen. I felt like just taking the gun out and throwing it away and giving up so I could get the mess over with. I opened my mouth so I wouldn't make so much noise when I breathed. Down the street I saw the patrol car was still at the corner. He had his lights flashing. I didn't know if he'd seen which way I was running or not. I knew I was too tired to keep running much more.
	I started to lift my arm to look at my watch and the whole arm just lit up with pain. The bone had to be broken. I figured it was two or three o'clock in the morning. Skeeter had called me just past midnight and told me they got Rico. I knew Rico was going to punk out. In a way I was glad they got him, but I knew he was going to blame everything on me.","Parents need to know that this is a book about drug abuse by street punks, so there are plenty of drug and violence references, though nothing graphic, and the main character is forced to confront what the drugs are doing to his life.

How I Resist: Activism and Hope for a New Generation,30 creative voices inspire teens to shape a better world.,"HOW I RESIST features 30 diverse voices talking about how teens can influence the world around them, from just being decent people to creating art, calling political representatives, and lobbying for change. The pieces include essays, interviews, poetry, artwork, and music, each with a brief bio. Some pieces are concrete and specific, such as Rock the Vote president Carolyn DeWitt's five suggestions for ways teens can be politically active before they can vote. Others explore how activists find their voices and learn to use them, such as Dylan Marrow (of the podcast Conversations with People Who Hate Me) and actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson, or offer heartfelt perspective and support, such as writers Rebecca Roanhorse and Alex Gino (George).
","There's no one right way to engage in democracy, and this passionate collection celebrates the many forms political activism can take -- from being authentic in your relationships to leading a march. How I Resist is an unabashedly liberal bundle of inspiring ideas. Edited by Maureen Johnson (Truly Devious), it offers refreshing creative breadth: Javier Muñoz discusses his experience performing in Hamilton, Jason Reynolds talks about how he finds hope, Karuna Riazi (The Gauntlet) writes poetically about caring for yourself so you can care for others. Other contributors teens may recognize include Rosie O'Donnell, actor Ali Stroker (Glee), and writers Sabaa Tahir, Jennifer Weiner, and Jodi Picoult.
Conservative readers may struggle to connect with some themes, but there's something for everyone. The mix of to-do lists, academic explorations, music, artwork, personal essays steeped in memory, and advice offers teens diverse ways to explore their political power.","Parents need to know that How I Resist: Activism and Hope for a New Generation is a diverse collection of liberal voices offering inspiration and concrete advice on how teens can make their voices heard -- and their presence felt -- both close to home and on a broader platform. Though solidly planted in the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, it promotes resistance as a means of questioning the status quo and helping to make the world a better place. The contributors bring a broad range of experience and perspective in terms of sexual orientation, ethnicities, and forms of political engagement, and include artists, academics, and leading activists. Some of the familiar names include Jacqueline Woodson (Brown Girl Dreaming), Jesse Tyler Ferguson (Modern Family), and Jason Reynolds (For Every One).

Gothic Lolita,Dark novel tries too hard to be deep and complicated.,"Two girls, one in America and one in Japan, find an unlikely and mystical connection to each other through their love of the Japanese fashion style ""Gothic Lolita"" and their unwavering love for their little brothers. Mysterious coincidences draw them closer together even thought they've never actually spoken to one another; one girl mourns the loss of her brother while the other tries to protect hers from being adopted. In a time of crisis and deep despair they reach out to each other in ways neither thought possible.
","This book may appeal more to teens who are into the ""Gothic Lolita"" style and culture than those who just happen upon this book. While it has some universal themes of love and the human connection, the author tries too hard to make a simple plot complex.
Author Dakota Lane uses poetic prose as a base on which she tries to weave darkness, mystery, and mythical connections into a gripping story that ultimately falls flat. The novel is earnest in its attempt to be deep, but never really achieves more than a superficial layer of mystery. Without the mystery or mystical connection, the novel plods along as heavy and overwrought as the crinoline skirts the fashion-obsessed teens wear.","Parents need to know that this is a dark novel dealing with themes of abandonment, deaths of loved ones -- both through natural causes and tragedy -- and some sexual situations. The ""Gothic Lolita"" style of dress originated in Japan and is very different than the western style of Goth.

Crankee Doodle,Yankee Doodle refuses to go town in silly takeoff.,"Yankee Doodle is bored, and so his pony suggests, ""We could go to town."" But the Yankee responds, ""Town? No way.

Chasing Space Young Reader's Edition,Stellar memoir of an elite athlete and astronaut's journey.,"In CHASING SPACE, Leland Melvin tells the epic story of how he became the first man to both be drafted into the NFL and travel to space. Raised in Lynchburg, Virginia, the smart and athletic Leland quickly becomes an excellent student-athlete, encouraged by his supportive parents and extended family. Studying chemistry and working in a lab s an undergraduate, Leland is able to attract enough attention as a wide receiver to get drafted by the Detroit Lions. Knowing that professional football careers are notoriously unstable, Leland wisely chooses to begin engineering graduate school as he conditions, learns playbooks, nd tries to find a way to stick in the league. Sure enough, his brief pro career is over before it starts, cut short by a hamstring injury and a better offer in his chosen field: space exploration. The rest of the book charts his meteoric rise from researcher to robotics engineer to an eventual placement in the astronaut program. After a dramatic injury during deep-sea training causes permanent damage, it's unclear if he will ever be physically cleared to fly. Leland must rely on his faith and his discipline to continue his career as an engineer and educator at NASA, and his hard work pays off when he is eventually assigned to two missions flying to the International Space Station. His star-studded life story sees him crossing paths with space pioneers, pop stars such as Pharrell, Mos Def, and will.i.am, and even both Presidents Bush (junior and senior) nd Obama, eventually leading to minor fame and a job hosting the TV show Child Genius. As an educator and advocate, Leland continues to encourage and contribute to programs in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math), particularly for students of color and around the world who may not know about the opportunities available to become space professionals. ","Leland Melvin's determination, courage, perseverance, and adaptability all shine through in this inspiring account of a remarkable career. Throughout Chasing Space, he constantly makes sure to point out all the opportunities and second chances given to him by various people and institutions that believed in him, stressing the importance of having a positive attitude and always showing your willingness to learn and grow.
With a straightforward writing style featuring fascinating insights into the realities of space travel nd a larger-than-life story that needs no embellishment, Melvin passes on his wisdom to future generations ""to spread the word about possibilities and connections, lighting the path for journeys humanity has yet to take.""

Duke Ellington: The Piano Prince and His Orchestra,"Charged-up intro to Ellington, his band & music.","A charged-up introduction to Duke Ellington, his band, and his music. Andrea Davis Pinkney tells the story in words as sparkling as the Duke's music, and her husband Brian's scratchboard artwork dances with color and pep. Kids will feel like they can step right into 1940s Harlem.
 ","This book calls up the spirit of Duke Ellington and his band through its whirling, swirling art and its vivid language. Although Andrea Davis Pinkney more than once pushes the lingo too far, leaving readers sprawling in the wake of her patter, mostly it is a fun and ear-opening ride, an exciting if taxing introduction to the jargon. Readers looking for a biography of Ellington should head elsewhere, for here the Pinkneys are trying to achieve a sense of time and place and impress readers with the effect that Ellington had both on the African-American community and on the world of music. It is not Ellington who rises from these pages, but his art.
As a read-aloud, Duke can be a strain for the reader as well as the listener; the text is so dazzling it blinds, then perhaps loses, its audience. Better, then, to let it hold its own as a read-alone so the words can be taken in at the reader's pace and savored like pieces of hard candy.","Parents need to know that this book contains no objectionable content.

Du Iz Tak?,Bugs speak gibberish and marvel at nature in joyous book.,"In DU IZ TAK? two bugs come upon a small sprout poking out of their little patch of ground and wonder about it (""Du iz tak?""). As the sprout unfurls and grows, so does the conversation. The bugs knock on the door of a log house to consult another bug friend, who brings a ladder so they can climb up and investigate. They build a fort, complete with pirate flag, but when a spider builds a web over it all, the angry bugs shake their fists at him (""BOOBY VOOBECK!""). Just then, a bird swoops down to eat the spider. The bugs again enjoy their fort, especially when a beautiful flower blooms atop it (""Unk scrivadelly gladdenboot!""). Alas, the flower wilts, but right nearby, a beautifully patterned moth emerges from a cocoon. Winter comes, then spring -- bringing more sprouts! ""Du iz tak?"" asks a new bug passing by. And so the cycle continues.
","This delightfully inventive book featuring industrious insects and a playfully made-up language calls for kids to reread and pore over the art so they can puzzle out what the bugs are saying. Du Iz Tak? works on so many levels. The bugs marvel over a growing plant, encouraging readers, too, to closely observe nature. The story adheres to the natural order -- growth and death, seasons, food chain -- while adding plenty of fanciful detail. The bugs build a tree house in the leaves, and a cricket plays a violin, sending music into the night. And though the growth of a plant may be slow going, author-illustrator Ellis imagines plenty of action, including squabbles over the tree house nd a marauding bird.
The Jabberwocky-like made-up language is pure silly fun. Since kids are still in language-learning mode, very actively decoding their primary languages, they'll jump to this fresh language-learning challenge.

Ella, Henny, Sarah, Charlotte, Gertie, and Charlie live with their parents, surrounded by extended family and friends whose affection for each other more than makes up for their community's modest means. The girls welcome a baby brother, enter the dating world, face serious illnesses, and celebrate milestones, while the family moves to other boroughs and the wider world enters World War I. There's always a lot going on for a family this large: Ella's boyfriend enlists in the Army, Henny runs for a spot in student government at a time when girls just didn't do that, and a dear friend is orphaned. The series follows the children in the family as they mature into young adults, each with their own personality and on their own path, but solidly together.
","These were among the first children's books that focused on Jewish characters, and author Sydney Taylor was careful to explain the significance of each holiday the family celebrates. Readers learn about the food and prayers of a Seder, the rules for observing the Sabbath, about the history of Passover, and more -- all surrounded by a family's love. The kids' everyday events have surprising depth, and are complex enough to keep readers' interest. Amid the everyday, the big events tackle politics: Workers' rights are a running theme, and the women's suffrage movement is in full force. There are layers to the story that readers will understand as they mature; the nuances of immigration, and Papa's acceptance that prayers will be heard whether they're said in English or Hebrew is a subtle acknowledgement that life is always changing. These sweet, enthralling books are full of kindness and family love, and they give a glimpse into a world that is both 100 years old and still relevant today.","Parents need to know that Sydney Taylor's All-of-a-Kind Family series delves deep into the lives of hardworking Jewish immigrants who are poor in material goods but rich in love. The language is fairly formal (think Laura Ingalls Wilder rather than Judy Blume), reflecting the style at the time the series was first published in 1951. These books use a close-knit family -- parents, five girls and one boy -- to explore the Jewish culture and how it changed as the children are born, grow up, and become adults themselves. The family celebrates every Jewish holiday -- often with thorny the political issues of the era as a backdrop -- and language and traditions are explained and translated. As the children grow up, there's the push-pull of tradition vs. assimilation so common in immigrant communities, but also struggles parents in any community can relate to: picky eaters, arguments about curfews, tantrums playing out all day, the rules for dating, and not having any space to yourself. These books are easy to read, but are surprisingly deep, so they work well for a wide range of reading abilities.

"Into the Still Blue: Under the Never Sky, Book 3",Trilogy finale regains energy for satisfying conclusion.,"The opening of INTO THE STILL BLUE finds Aria, Perry, and their tribemates at a literal low point, living in caves and desperate to make their next move against their rival, Sable. Aria has been shot, and her arm refuses to heal properly. The Aether storms, which make life on the surface highly dangerous, are getting stronger. And Perry has to find a way to rescue Cinder, the troubled boy who may hold the key to controlling the Aether. Can they work with their enemies to find a way to survive, or will their salvation come only through violence?
","Maybe some tales of futuristic dystopias ren't meant to be stretched across three volumes. The Under the Never Sky trilogy started promisingly, but its momentum flagged in the second installment. The final book regains some of the lost energy, but much of the story feels repetitive and stretched out, especially those scenes in which characters squabble longer than is interesting. Longtime fans probably will be happy with the saga's resolution, but some will be eager for author Veronica Rossi to move on to a new setting and cast of characters.","Parents need to know that Into the Still Blue is the third installment in the dystopian adventure romance series that began with Under the Never Sky and continued in Through the Ever Night. It contains scenes of violence, including a brutal beating, the shooting deaths of some important supporting characters, and a climactic strangling. Although the protagonists, Aria and Perry, clearly sleep in the same bed and share a sexually intimate relationship, the level of sexual content does not rise much higher than some passionate kissing and embraces.

The Eyes of Kid Midas,One of the most exciting fantasy-adventures ever.,"Kevin Midas is a seventh grader who gets picked on a lot. On a camping trip he climbs to the top of a mysterious Indian mountain just at the summer solstice, and finds a pair of sunglasses there. He soon discovers that they make his wishes come true, and he and his best friend, Josh, have a wonderful time wishing for everything they ever wanted.
But this is only the beginning. He also discovers that they cannot undo what they have done, and that when exposed to sources of electricity, such as a wall socket, they become stronger. Soon they begin to make anything he says come true, then to make any passing thought real, and finally to reach deep within his mind. In addition they find that using the glasses becomes physically addictive, the realities they create become normal to everyone else, and Kevin has an enemy who also knows about the glasses.
","One of the most exciting, suspenseful, and enthralling adventures to come along in some time, and this makes a superb read-aloud. In addition, it provides the deep satisfaction of pushing an idea as far as it can go, and far beyond the boundaries of the usual story.
This author's imagination is not limited by normal boundaries. The first half of the book is very funny, but as things get further and further out of control, as the glasses and Kevin's mind begin to change the fundamental order of the universe, the consequences are sobering and breathtaking. It would be hard to imagine the child who could put this book down before the end.","Parents need to know that among issues of power and wishes lurks a hidden metaphorical theme: The entire progress of the glasses' hold on Kevin exactly parallels the course of drug addiction and withdrawal.

"Keeper of the Lost Cities, Book 1",Super-imaginative adventures of girl whisked to elf world.,"Twelve-year-old Sophie has been telepathic since she was 5, and it's brought her nothing but trouble, from perennial migraines to the social difficulties of being a prodigy in school. She's kept her talent to herself, as her lovably ordinary family would not understand it. Then one day on a field trip to the museum, she meets a strikingly good-looking boy who's also a telepath -- and informs her that she's actually not human, she's an elf who's been hidden in the human world. Soon she's whisked away forever from her family and transported to the elf world, where she must cope with hazards from would-be abductors to the pitfalls of middle school, all while trying to fit in and understand who she is.
","The first in a new series by Shannon Messenger, this book is imaginative, well-conceived and well-written, with believable, complex characters and a fully realized fantasy world parallel to our own. Friendship, family bonds, and trying to do the right thing in difficult circumstances all come to the fore as Sophie and her friends try to figure out the mystery of her origin and face unexpected dangers. ","Parents need to know that Shannon Messenger's debut novel, Keeper of the Lost Cities, is imaginative, well-crafted, and engaging, with a strong girl protagonist and plenty of interesting supporting characters. From the beginning, 12-year-old Sophie is in danger from forces threatened by her existence, and only gradually becomes aware of them in scary incidents, including multiple kidnapping attempts. In addition, she's traumatized by being torn from the human family that raised her and transported to the elf world to start a completely different life, and this is portrayed so effectively that it may be too emotionally intense for some young readers. With those caveats, the book has much to offer in the way of imaginative issues and plot twists, not to mention credible, appealing role models showing loyalty, friendship, and courage.

Written in the Stars,Compelling tale of Pakistani-American forced into marriage.,"When Pakistani-American teen Naila lies to her parents so she can attend prom with her boyfriend, Saif, she has no idea of the high price she’ll pay for that deception. Shocked by their daughter’s disobedience, Naila's parents use a family trip to Pakistan as cover for their plan to force her into marriage with a man they will choose for her. At first, Nalia's excited by the adventure of her first trip to Pakistan and meeting her father's large extended family, but as their return to the United States is constantly postponed, she grows suspicious of her parents’ motives. When her cousin, Selma, reveals her parents have found a husband for her and are planning a wedding, Naila uses the cell phone Saif gave her and secretly calls him for help. But within days, Naila finds herself married to man she does not know and watched constantly by his disapproving mother and sister. With no one in her family willing to help her, she must rely on Saif to come to her rescue.
","Author Aisha Saeed,  Pakistani-American whose own happy marriage was ""semi-arranged"" by her parents, brings authenticity and a welcome lack of what easily could have been overblown melodrama. Although few readers may ever face a forced marriage, all can identify with Naila's struggles to follow rules set by her parents while finding independence for herself. The book should start meaningful conversations between parents and teens not only about rules and expectations but the issue of women’s rights throughout the world.","Parents need to know that Written in the Stars is the story of Naila, a Pakistani-American high school senior, torn between love for her culturally conservative immigrant parents and Saif, the boyfriend she keeps secret from them. When her outraged parents discover the romance, they take Naila and her brother on a ""vacation"" to visit relatives in rural Pakistan, with plans to force her into an arranged marriage to a local man. There's minor kissing, some physical violence (a girl's father slaps her, and another adult relative kicks her), and one incident of marital rape that's not described.

Eddie Red Undercover: Mystery on Museum Mile,Boy sketch artist helps catch art thieves in zippy mystery.,"EDDIE RED UNDERCOVER: MYSTERY ON MUSEUM MILE is told through the eyes of 11-year-old Edmund Lonnrot, a short African-American sixth grader with two special skills -- he has a photographic memory and he's an exceptional artist. When the New York City police discover his talent, they enlist him as an afterschool and weekend undercover observer and sketch artist to help solve a baffling series of thefts in Manhattan museums. In return, ""Eddie Red, as the lead detective dubs him, hopes to earn enough money to attend a prestigious private school his family could not otherwise afford. He works and clashes with a hard-boiled detective who doesn't really want Eddie on the case. Meanwhile, Eddie gets help from his brainy and obsessive friend Jonah as they try to crack the mystery together.
","Eddie Red Undercover: Mystery on Museum Mile is the first novel by Marcia Wells, and it's a zippy and engaging read, with plenty of humor and vivid characters. It also features wonderful sketches of different people in the story (supposedly by Eddie, but actually done by illustrator Marcos Calo) that really capture their personalities. The world of fine art and New York museums is perhaps a slightly odd choice as a setting for middle-grade novel, but Wells manages to make it seem quite interesting and exciting. Young readers will definitely learn a few things about art -- and the intricacies of police work -- along the way. One complaint: The solution to one of the primary mysteries of the book is almost incomprehensible, even if you are chess fanatic. That's the only downer in an otherwise fine book.
 ","Parents need to know that Eddie Red Undercover: Mystery on Museum Mile is a taut, often funny mystery about an African-American sixth grader who becomes embroiled in a complex case involving art thieves. The police enlist his help after they discover he has a photographic memory and can draw perfect sketches of possible suspects. There's some violence, including one graphic shooting and Eddie being duct-taped to a drainpipe by a criminal, but it's a small part of the story. Eddie's also the victim of some mild taunting/bullying at school. The book does not talk down to its target audience; in fact, it includes a fair amount of complicated vocabulary, unexplained mentions of ADHD and OCD and the slang ""meds,"" as well as discussions of artists and New York museums. Eddie's race does not factor into the story in any significant way, but it's notable because of the relative rarity of having the main character in this type of book be a person of color. The novel features a number of Eddie's sketches of characters (including himself and his father) and suspects -- engaging black-and-white full-page portraits by illustrator Marcos Calo -- as well as a couple of Manhattan street maps. This is the first book in the Eddie Red series.

Worse, Victoria's father starts a House Beautification Committee (""Making our city beautiful, one house at a time"") that targets Auggie and all her neighbors in the poor section of town and insists that they improve their homes. Auggie's grandfather, who runs a salvage business, collects items with which they create a colorful new look with ingenuity and creativity -- turning a worn-out toaster into a rooftop flower, for example. Their project horrifies the committee even more, and it deems their home in violation and demands a hefty fine, which Auggies' family can't afford. Eviction looks probable -- until a folk-art museum director sees what they've created, and the town's concept of what's beautiful changes.

The Secrets of Valhalla,Fantasy with Norse gods lacks clarity.,"When Buzz meets Mary, a new girl at school, they click somehow. He decides to walk her home through Tangley Woods, and both spot the strangest thing: the local weatherwoman who had been declared missing tied to an enormous tree by a fire rope. But that's not the weirdest thing about the encounter. She claims to be the Norse day guardian, Sunna, who'd been slumbering in the weatherwoman's body. But then Loki broke free from his prison, and her godly alter ego had to emerge to stop him. She and the other day guardians need to gather back their power that's been trapped in ruins and hidden. They all need their runes and restored power to defeat Loki. Before they can free Sunni and help her, she's whisked away by a dragon into the underworld. Buzz and Mary don't know what to do to help, so they go home. After no one believes Buzz, he tries to forget the whole thing, but things just keep getting stranger. Without the day guardians around, he keeps waking up on the same Saturday morning, and only Mary and Buzz seem to notice.
","Even following a tried-and-true formula of modern kids having mythological adventures, this story is too lacking in fundamental areas to make it work. SECRETS OF VALHALLA never takes off because it doesn't take the time to build this world or the characters in it. Readers never have a chance to be in awe of the mysteries of Tangley woods because author Jasmine Richards doesn't fully describe it or why Buzz's father is so entranced by it. And each time Buzz and his sidekick Mary travel to a cloud palace or an undersea kingdom, readers will be too lost in her lack of careful description to be awed by the author's creativity.
A sense of the characters on the landscape she creates is also missing, as are thoughtful descriptions of characters and their motivations. It's hard to ever feel grounded in this story. Even or perhaps especially in fantasy realms, you have to ground the writing enough to tell a compelling story. A winning formula won't do all the work.","Parents need to know that Secrets of Valhalla is a fantasy steeped in Norse mythology by Jasmine Richards (The Book of Wonders).While the storytelling is confusing, the violence is milder than mythological stories by Rick Riordan (Percy Jackson series).

How High the Moon,Girl seeks family secrets in hopeful Jim Crow-era tale.,"It's 1943, and 12-year-old Ella and her friends Myrna nd Henry are living in the Jim Crow South. Ella, the main character of HOW HIGH THE MOON, lives with her grandmother, who's taken in Myrna from her unwed mother. Ella doesn't know who her father is -- though everyone suspects he's white. Her mother, Lucy, lives in Boston, where she works in a shipbuilding factory and pursues her dream of a singing career. Ella is ecstatic to get a letter from her mother inviting her to come stay with her. But once there, she finds Helen, the roommate who cuddles up in Mama's bed when Ella wants to be there. And between work at the shipyard and performing at nightclubs, Mama is hardly ever home. She doesn't get around to enrolling Ella in school, so the girl spends long, boring days by herself in the small apartment until Lucy takes off for New York and sends Ella back to South Carolina. And no one, including her mother, will tell Ella nything more about her father than that he went to California. The same day she gets back to South Carolina, one of Ella's friends, George Stinney, is arrested and charged with murder.
","This heartfelt tale about childhood in the Jim Crow South brings us  girl who finds a sense of family despite an absent mother, a mystery father, and a cruel society. How High the Moon, the debut novel from Karyn Parsons, grew out of a conversation the author had with her mother. Parsons wondered how her mother could claim she had a happy childhood when she grew up in the South under Jim Crow. The subplot about the boy who's wrongfully executed comes from a real legal case. The strength of the novel is the character of Ella: Her close relationship with her grandmother, longing to be with her mother, and desperation to know who her father is all ring true.
There are two main weaknesses. First, the author chose to have each of the three children narrate chapters. However, this isn't quite balanced, since Ella's clearly the main character and the other narrators and their perspectives are not as well developed. This technique seems like a clumsy way of providing backstory. Second, a few of the Jim Crow stories seem like rehashed scenes from To Kill A Mockingbird. ","Parents need to know that How High the Moon is a hopeful historical novel set in South Carolina and Boston during the mid-1940s. The three main characters, middle school kids Ella, Myrna, and Henry, are exposed to daily loss of dignity living under Jim Crow laws, as well as serious injustice: A 14-year-old boy is executed for murder after a forced confession and improper trial. There's a scene where children discover the bodies of a man, woman, and child hanging from trees after being lynched. There are several scenes of bullying, both physical assault and mean language. One boy bullies another in school and that boy is slapped by his brother within eyeshot of other people, who do not intervene. Some white boys catch Ella in the woods and knock her to the ground. Ella's mother is in a lesbian relationship, revealed when the girl finds the two women cuddling together in bed s they sleep. There's a scene where Ella's mother and her companion drink whiskey, and another where Ella finds glasses with whiskey in them.

","Jacob is a likeable protagonist, and many children will identify with his trials as the youngest in a large family. But these bad guys wouldn't be out of place in a Roald Dahl novel. Some parents may be bothered by a country club president who says, ""[W]e have to come to accept a few members who are black or Italian or Jewish or Greek, so long as they are also filthy rich.""
The broad satire is funny, but the cynicism is what skews the age recommendation to 9 for this easy-to-read chapter book. It's also more intense and darkly funny than in the friendly, sibling rivalry-focused animated series. This is a satisfyingly quick read -- chapters are usually only two or three pages, and the action moves the plot along at a lively pace. This is a good pick for an otherwise reluctant reader.","Parents need to know that the villains in this book are ridiculously bad authority figures. Over-the-top evil deeds and bad attitudes abound, but good wins out in the end. The broad satire is funny, but the cynicism is what skews the age recommendation to 9.

","Not only does this book have negative messages, but it isn't even well-written, limiting its appeal even as a guilty pleasure.

The Adventures of a Girl Called Bicycle,Girl bikes across the U.S. in quirky road-trip adventure.,"In THE ADVENTURES OF A GIRL CALLED BICYCLE, a toddler is found in the Mostly Silent Monastery in Washington, D.C., where she's named ""Bicycle"" for the T-shirt she's wearing, and raised by Sister Wanda, who homeschools her. Bicycle grows up to love her bike, called Clunk, but Sister Wanda worries that she doesn't have friends, so when Bicycle turns 12, the nun decides to send her to a camp called The Friendship Factory that advertises ""Three Guaranteed Friendships or Your Money Back."" But Bicycle has another plan. She wants to befriend Zbig Sienkieweicz, an international cycling star who's making an appearance at the Blessing of the Bicycles in San Francisco. So she hops on her bike and crosses the country on her own, meeting challenges, setbacks, and a slew of oddball characters along the way. Will Bicycle make it? Will she meet Zbig? Will he agree to be her friend?
","This offbeat road-trip story, in which a 12-year-old girl bikes solo cross-country, is enlivened by the eccentric characters she meets along the way, as well as the majesty of the U.S. landscape. The Adventures of a Girl Called Bicycle draws on author Christina Uss' own experience with long-distance bike trips, and the story's infused with her love of cycling, sweetening the ride.
Uss has a broad, breezy, folksy style, exaggerating for comic effect. For instance, Bicycle meets French Chef Marie, who's come to America to open a vast chain of locavore cafes that conveniently dot Bicycle's route, providing unending eats. And, in a town where there's an annual pig parade, she eats fried pies with fillings like kielbasa-'n'-mustard and peanut butter-and-sorghum. The characters and situations are often improbable, and some readers will love that and giggle along, while others might prefer to be grounded in a more realistic story. But all readers will root for Bicycle, an endearingly determined protagonist, and will have fun traveling with her from the Civil War battlefield sites of Virginia to the Bicycle Blessing ceremony in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park.","Parents need to know that The Adventures of a Girl Called Bicycle by debut novelist Christina Uss features a spunky 12-year-old girl protagonist named Bicycle who takes a cross-country trip by herself on her bike.

Molly also loves softball and plays well, but their father only cares about Allie. Can the two sisters and their father reconcile? Girls in sports have been waiting for this book, which cheers them on all the way, but boys who give it a chance like it too.
 ","Plenty of girls have become just as involved in sports as boys are, so they'll cheer a book that portrays sports-loving girls as completely normal. But author Kathy Mackel doesn't touch upon any of the difficulties female athletes still face. In fact, everyone in this story treats girls' softball as though it were the only game in town. The local newspaper interviews Allie and prints her pitching statistics as a regular feature. Crowds attend the games. It's as though girls never had trouble getting into sports. If the book were written about boys, only the names would have to be changed.

Mo'ne Davis: Remember My Name: My Story from First Pitch to Game Changer,Inspirational memoir of Little League history maker.,"You may have heard a lot about Mo'Ne Davis, the first female pitcher to win a game in the Little League World Series. She was the first Little Leaguer featured on Sports Illustrated magazine's cover and entered the National Baseball Hall of Fame at age 13. What you may not know is she plays many sports, she's afraid of the dark, and she was recruited to her team at 7. Find out more about the year she started having good luck straight from the girl herself.
","Mo'Ne Davis, with the help of author Hilary Beard, paints quite a vivid picture of a normal girl who loves sports and works hard to excel at them. The story is largely inspirational, sometimes frustrating (due to the biases of adults), and fun. The first-person voice -- sometimes as an interview with friends and family -- can be a bit hard to navigate and follow along with, but overall Mo'Ne's message and personality come through clearly.
What's important to note is how well Mo'Ne (as well as those around her) handles the pressure of her newfound fame and recognizes and appreciates the phenomenal opportunities that have come her way as a direct result of her hard work. ","Parents need to know that Mo'Ne Davis: Remember My Name: My Story from First Pitch to Game Changer, by Davis and Hilary Beard, is a memoir by the first girl pitcher to win a game in the Little League World Series. She briefly discusses her mother having a child at 16, and she speaks about kids and adults behaving in an unsportsmanlike manner when encountering a girl on a ""boys' team."" Parents should be ready to discuss gender discrimination and stereotypes in sports.

Children of Eden,Familiar dystopian tale pushes limits of believability.,"CHILDREN OF EDEN is set a few hundred years from now, after Earth's natural resources have been destroyed and only a tiny fraction of humanity has been saved. Rowan is a second child, someone who should not be allowed to exist. After 16 years of being hidden away in her parents' home, she's suddenly thrust into the world outside, where nothing makes sense and every action is fraught with danger. As she struggles to figure out whom to trust, she moves ever closer to a startling secret that could change civilization forever.
","This perplexing novel uses every convention of dystopian YA science fiction: confused but tough female lead, authoritarian villains, romantic triangles, vast conspiracies. These elements are so familiar, it's hard to tell whether the use of obvious cliché is intentional or not. In any case, the novel pushes the limits of believability. Children of Eden's main character, Rowan, is sympathetic, but she never seems to stop talking and stating the obvious. The world-building doesn't seem to make much sense, and coincidence seems to be the major motivator of the plot. Many readers will no doubt be attracted by the story's breathless earnestness, but the more critical among them may roll their eyes.
Beware that the book ends in a cliffhanger, even though there's no warning that this is the first volume in a series.","Parents need to know that Children of Eden, written by social media and YouTube celebrity Joey Graceffa with Laura L. Sullivan, is a science-fiction thriller set in a dystopian environment where Earth's natural habitat is presumed destroyed. It contains some violence -- including torture similar to waterboarding and the semi-accidental slitting of a character's throat. There are a few passionate kisses; the only strong language is four or five uses of ""hell."" Although it's not explicitly branded as such, Children of Eden seems to be the first volume of a series.

"Closer: Tunnels Series, Book 4",New twists keep exciting but violent adventure going.,"In CLOSER, Will, Elliott, and Dr. Burrows continue to explore the mysterious jungle world at the center of the Earth, never dreaming that a danger they know all too well will soon threaten their newly peaceful existence. Meanwhile, not knowing the trio's fate, Chester heads Topsoil with Martha but is eager to leave the increasingly unbalanced woman behind if and when he can. He eventually joins up with an old ally -- who has a very unexpected new partner. As plot twists take the characters in new directions, their underlying goal remains the same: Stop the evil Styx from destroying humanity with the deadly Dominion virus.
","Fans who've enjoyed the Tunnels series so far will find plenty more to like here. This is a solidly entertaining, well-paced series that continues to take its story in interesting (albeit implausible -- but, hey, it's fantasy) directions. It doesn't have the magic of Harry Potter or the humor and crackle of Percy Jackson, but it's creative and engrossing.
Few of the characters are 100 percent reliable or likable, but they do continue to develop and change throughout this book and the series -- something fans will appreciate. Will is now more thoughtful than he was at the start of the series, for example, and the once-pitiable Mrs. Burrows is becoming a veritable heroine. There are some shocking, grim moments here, but fans of the books will certainly be expecting them at this point and will be eager to see where the series goes next.","Parents need to know that Closer continues the Tunnels' series mix of exciting adventure and frequent peril and violence. At this point, fans will be used to the near-constant danger and the teen characters' propensity for bombs and guns, but a couple of incidents particularly stand out: the shocking death of a key character and the gruesome disposal of other murder victims. Characters are kidnapped, tortured, hit, threatened, and more; there are also several big explosions. One central adult character has been drinking to the point of passing out, but he cleans up his act when he rediscovers a sense of purpose. And despite all of the terrible things that happen to the protagonists, overall their story is still one of loyalty, bravery, and doing the right thing.

Chomp! Zoo,"Detailed, funny illustrations show what zoo animals do.","Heather Brown's picture book CHOMP! ZOO tells, with just a couple of words per page, what a selection of wild animals do with their mouths: ""elephant trumpets, komodo dragon hisses, sea lion barks, panda munches,"" etc. Each page shows a detailed color illustration of one delightfully grinning animal; most of the creatures have great big, wavy rows of teeth.
","The detailed, somewhat realistic illustrations in Chomp! Zoo, combined with the repetition of uniformly large, wavy rows of teeth, creates an arresting visual style. Kids will certainly remember these pictures, and will learn to identify the animals and what they do and say. This picture book makes a nice change from the cuteness of typical children's illustrations; these pictures will make youngsters notice the different colors and textures of the animals' hides or fur, and may inspire young artists to see and draw animals in new ways.","Parents need to know that Heather Brown's Chomp! Zoo shows young children friendly, detailed, stylized illustrations of zoo animals, along with a couple of words about what each animal does (""Elephant trumpets,"" ""Panda munches,"" etc.). This book is short and simple in structure; some words are above easy-reader level (particularly ""komodo dragon""), but most will be instantly recognizable to readers of any level because of the illustrations. Very young children will learn to recognize different animals and what they do with their mouths (the sounds they make, what they eat). In most of the illustrations, the creatures have surprisingly large teeth -- some kids could be alarmed by the ""Tiger chomps"" page.

Baseball Great,Clunky but taut story of Little League steroids.,"When Josh's father, a minor-league baseball player, is cut from his team, he gets a job with an under-14 championship traveling team, and pushes Josh into joining. Despite grueling practices and some hazing, Josh is beginning to fit in. But then he is offered steroids by one of the other kids, steroids that the other players use, and that presumably come from the intense and somewhat scary coach -- who is now his father's employer.
","Author Tim Green is not yet a great writer, but he is a terrific storyteller. And when you have a plot this compelling it almost doesn't matter that the prose sometimes sounds like the stuff of a freshman composition class (""like biting into a ruby red apple only to find a brown worm crawling through the crisp, white fruit""). Yikes! But a few pages in and young readers won't care -- they'll be hooked by the suspenseful, ripped-from-the-headlines story, doled out in teeny chapters with artificial mini-cliffhangers at the end of each.
They also won't care that the characters are one-dimensional stereotypes (the bully, the obsessed coach, the modest boy-wonder and his sidekick, the tough teen girl reporter/detective with a heart of gold, etc.) -- because they're good stereotypes. They're satisfying. Josh is a major talent who also works harder than anyone else, and the story of his triumphs is like a realistic wish-fulfillment fantasy, a down-to-earth superhero story.
From the Book:
	When he saw his home, a narrow, red two-story place with a steep roof and a sagging front porch, he breathed deep, and his heart began to slow. The previous owner had three pit bulls, and so a chain-link fence surrounded the house and its tiny front and back lawns, separating them from the close-packed neighbors on either side. The driveway ran tight to the house, and like the single, detached garage, it was just outside the fence. Josh lifted the latch, but as he pulled open the front gate, a hand appeared from nowhere, slamming it shut. The latch clanked home, and the hand spun Josh around. ""What you running from?"" asked Bart Wilson, the tenth-grade smoker.","Parents need to know that this is a story about an adult coach who gives steroids to the children on his under-14 baseball team. The main character doesn't take them and works to stop the coach. There's also a short but nasty fistfight in a public bathroom.

Pan's Labyrinth: The Labyrinth of the Faun,"Dark, magical adaptation matches the intensity of the movie.","PAN'S LABYRINTH: THE LABYRINTH OF THE FAUN is an enchanted work of magical realism by famed Mexican writer and director Guillermo del Toro set during the waning days of the Spanish resistance against the fascist dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Adapted into a novel for young readers and teens by best-selling fantasy author Cornelia Funke, the book tells the story of a young girl, Ofelia, who travels with her pregnant and recently widowed mother to an old mill that has been occupied by Franco's Falangist soldiers under the command of her new stepfather, Captain Vidal. On the night of her arrival, Ofelia encounters a magical fairy who leads her to an ancient maze behind the mill where she meets a magical faun who tells her that she is actually a princess and the heir to the throne of the underworld. To unlock her destiny and return to the underworld -- where she might be reunited with her dead father -- she must follow his instructions and complete three tasks. While Ofelia works on completing her magical mission, Captain Vidal and the Falangists battle with the guerrilla resistance fighters in the surrounding woods, who are secretly receiving assistance from the captain's servant, Mercedes, and his doctor, Ferreira. Ofelia retreats into the world of magic to escape the brutality of the war zone she's living in, but the horrors of Vidal's reign of terror are impossible to escape. The Wolf, as she calls Vidal, continues to torment both her and the rebels in his midst, leaving a trail of bodies behind him as he tries to snuff out the last hopes of the desperate opposition. Interspersed between the chapters of the main narrative, which tell the story shown in the film, re brand-new fairy tales that reveal the backstories behind many of the fantastical creatures in the book.
","Thrilling, enchanting, and heartbreaking, this well-achieved adaptation of a sensational film is an absolute page-turner. Cornelia Funke's writing is powerful and effective, preserving the mystery and wizardry of the original, while del Toro's handpicked illustrator, Allen Williams, adds striking visuals to accompany the text. As with any adaptation -- especially of such a stunning and imaginative film -- it's difficult to capture all of the creativity of the source material, but Funke does a nice job of re-creating the film almost shot-for-shot. And the new fairy tales re excellent additions that enrich the overall story and add something for fans of the movie who might wonder why they would want to read the book version. These allegorical vignettes not only give the reader a deeper understanding of del Toro's magical universe but lso provide welcome relief from the unrelenting darkness of Ofelia's tragic struggle. By the end of the book, it's hard to know what was real and what was fantasy, but perhaps the lesson is that true magic is conjured out of courage, selflessness, and hope even in the face of insurmountable odds and unimaginable evil. While Pan's Labyrinth is certainly darker and less fun than Harry Potter or even A Series of Unfortunate Events, fans of those series who don't mind a bit of tragedy and history mixed in with their magic will find plenty to love in this reworking of a modern classic.  ","Parents need to know that Pan's Labyrinth: The Labyrinth of the Faun, is a faithful adaptation written by children's fantasy author Cornelia Funke of Guillermo del Toro's classic film of the same name. The movie is often described as a work of magical realism, and the book as well is a dark, scary, and violent fairy tale set in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). It includes scenes of murder, firefights, and torture, though the book doesn't go into too much gory detail. Still, some main characters meet gruesome ends, several firefights leave dozens dead, and a wounded soldier gets his infected leg sawed off. Despite the bleak storyline and terrifying monsters -- both mythical and human -- this is a story of resilience and self-sacrifice in the face of cruelty and hopelessness. There are a couple of instances of cursing, including ""son of a bitch"" and ""a--holes.""

The Key That Swallowed Joey Pigza,Joey tries to heal his family in emotional series finale.,"THE KEY THAT SWALLOWED JOEY PIGZA is another emotional adventure about Joey, who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, a depressed mother, and a dirty home filled with roaches. In this final installment of the series, Joey has to stop school to care full-time for his baby brother when their depressed mother checks herself into the hospital. As she leaves, she warns Joey that his father -- who recently deserted the family -- will try to steal the baby, Carter Junior, so Joey must protect him. Sensitive Joey, who can feel the emotions of everyone around him, becomes determined to fix his family (""I just need to remember my special gift -- if I can feel all the good that's in them, then I think it will work out"").  ","The outrageous characters make this book a highly creative, entertaining story. There's Joey's angry, blind girlfriend; his father, who's trying to heal his botched face-lift; and Joey himself, who eats nothing but pizza and marches to school ""with my head thrown back and arms pumping up and down like I was the conductor of an All-Star All-Roach marching band."" But be warned: For a thin, kooky book, The Key That Swallowed Joey Pigza packs an emotional wallop.
Readers may be shocked by the terrible things his parents tell him (""I already ruined you,"" his mother says. ""Inside your head is a ticking time bomb"") and feel deep empathy for poor Joey when he curls up in the crib his father prepared for his baby brother and begins sucking his thumb. In the end, readers will cheer for Joey and his hard-won fight to put together his highly imperfect family -- and stand up for himself.","Parents need to know that The Key That Swallowed Joey Pigza by Newbery ward-winning author Jack Gantos is the fifth and final book in a series about a boy from a troubled home who has ADHD.

She also says that someday she'll stick her head in the oven and tells Joey that he is a ""ticking time bomb"" who will do something awful one day. Also, Joey's dad throws a pizza at Joey while trying to kidnap Joey's baby brother. Some adults smoke, and beer cans litter Joey's yard. Readers will gain some understanding of what it feels like to have ADHD and learn empathy for people who learn to cope with this difference.

Kente Colors,Presents images of African village life.,"Indigo blue is the African sky, red is a sunset, and gold is a crown in this picture book introducing kente colors.
Kente, a fabric developed by the Ashanti and Ewe people of Ghana and Togo that has become fashionable in the United States, is symbolically connected to its roots in African culture. An author's note explains kente's history and its uses.
","Through vivid paintings, KENTE COLORS presents images of African village life. No story is told; the images re merely distinct displays of various ceremonies and occasions when kente cloth is traditionally worn. In the frontispiece the author only hints at the fabric's popularity in the United States, where, for example, African-American clergy wear kente stoles over their robes. The poem's rhythm is obstructed by the intensity of unrelated paintings by John Ward. Each page, with multihued kente-cloth borders, is bold and bright, yet the dominant color is often hard to identify amid the jumble of other colors.
Kente Colors tries to be about too much at once: history, culture, ethnic pride. The concluding author's note comes too late and only confuses.","Parents need to know that the beautiful images of African culture overwhelm the rhyming text, which doesn't express the ceremonial and symbolic significance of kente.

What I Lost,"Realistic, uplifting tale of teen in treatment for anorexia.","In WHAT I LOST, teen Elizabeth Barnes is checked into a residential treatment facility for her anorexia. A visit she figures will be a week, tops, turns into more than a month of hard work and self-realization. One of the biggest problems she faces in recovery is wanting to recover. Told in first person, Elizabeth relates her struggles in detail. While she frets about her friends and ex-boyfriend moving on in junior year and leaving her behind, she makes new friends in treatment and gains empathy for those battling their own demons. She learns that many people have their own emotional baggage, even if they display no outward signs of it. Her relationship with her parents and their behaviors around her illness are eye-opening. A romantic mystery involving a secret admirer sending her gifts while she's in the treatment center balances the more serious plot points.
","This uplifting and engaging story of a girl battling anorexia is a good choice for teens who like topical reads. In What I Lost, author Alexandra Ballard shows the reader how anorexics' minds work: the mental games they play, how they see themselves, and the negative things they say to themselves. We also see the cultural and social factors that contribute to anorexia. Elizabeth's a smart, funny, kind narrator whom readers will root for as she works through her problems. The other girls in treatment have the same illness but come from different backgrounds and have different battles to deal with. In this way, Ballard shows why treatment is difficult: There's no one-size-fits-all solution.
Elizabeth's difficult relationship with her parents is realistically portrayed. Instead of being the one-dimensional characters often found in YA fiction, her parents are well fleshed-out and grow and change over the course of the book. The subplots around Elizabeth's school friends, ex-boyfriend, and a mystery admirer keep What I Lost from getting too heavy and tough to read. In all, Ballard does a good job of making difficult subject matter enjoyable and engaging.","Parents need to know that Alexandra Ballard's What I Lost is a novel about a teen, Elizabeth, battling anorexia. The story follows Elizabeth's ups and downs in treatment, detailing the numerous factors that contribute to anorexia and the difficulties in treating it. Readers will get an idea of the mental and physical challenges anorexics face and the ripple effect the disease has on friends and family. Most of the book takes place in a residential treatment facility, where Elizabeth meets girls with lots of personal issues. Family dynamics are  strong theme, and the story provides great discussion topics for families. The book has no violence, some making out, nd infrequent strong language (includes ""shit,"" ""hell,"" ""God,"" ""damn,"" and ""a--hole"").

"Silence: The Queen of the Dead, Book 1",Paranormal adventure bogs down in details.,"In SILENCE, a strange encounter in a cemetery leaves high school student Emma with the ability to communicate with the dead. Soon she's able to see her departed father, but she also receives frantic messages regarding a ghostly child trapped within a perpetually burning building. As she learns to use magic, Emma grows ever closer to becoming a Necromancer, a state of affairs that might require one of her presumed allies to kill her.
","Silence has an interesting, suspenseful premise and an engaging cast of characters. Unfortunately, the narrative is a little talky, with characters frequently engaging in long, vague conversations about how Emma's powers are supposed to work. When it shows action and character development, Silence is effective, but it occasionally breaks its own spell with too much telling.","Parents need to know that Silence (the first book in the Queen of the Dead series) is an intense story of paranormal intrigue, featuring a protagonist who can communicate with the dead. There's a fair amount of profanity (""f--k,"" ""a--hole""), some violence, and a lot of supernatural action. Characters interact with various ghosts, some of whom died in horrible circumstances, and there's a harrowing sequence featuring a 4-year-old ghost still trapped in a burning building. One character's college-age brother shows up drunk at a party, but he's also under the influence of magic.

The Three Billy Goats Gruff,"Classic tale given new, thoughtful ending and exquisite art.","In THE THREE BILLY GOATS GRUFF, three hungry goats live on the rocky side of a bridge. They want to get to the other side where there's plenty of grass, but a mean troll guards the bridge. When the smallest, youngest goat tries to cross, the troll wants to gobble him up, but the littlest goat tells him to wait for the next billy goat: ""He’s much bigger than me."" The second, bigger goat crosses using the same tack. And when the third, really large, goat crosses, he butts the troll off the bridge and into the water, where he's almost eaten by a very large fish: ""But the troll was probably a bit too sour and green to make a tasty meal."" As the troll climbs onto the shore, he sees lots of goats now freely crossing the bridge. The art shows him then making a new house, this time on the rocky side.
","This classic tale featuring a greedy ""troll with a heart of stone"" is action-packed and lovingly illustrated nd brims with emotional resonance. Pinkney's pencil-and-watercolor art makes The Three Billy Goats Gruff a triumph. He excels at drawing animals, making them realistically animal-like and expressive at the same time. The faces of his goats are sweetly appealing, while his troll is suitably scary, a gnarled green creature with fangs, claw-like nails, and a snapping lion's tail. He also pulls out lots of action words -- ""SPLASH!"" ""GULP!"" -- to enliven the telling nd adds a foldout page to extend the fun when the biggest goat crashes the gate -- ""BAM!""
But the real coup is that Pinkney manages to give the story a more thoughtful ending without taking the bite out of it. The goats do triumph, and the troll does get his comeuppance, but he doesn't die or disappear, and the art sagely suggests that the end of the book might actually be a new beginning for the troll and goats. This story, with lots of opportunities for repetition and prediction, preserves the fun of the beloved original while inviting discussions about greed, bullying, and chances to change.","Parents need to know that The Three Billy Goats Gruff by Caldecott Medalist Jerry Pinkney (The Lion & the Mouse) is a gorgeously illustrated, beautifully told version of the classic folk tale that spins the end a bit differently. In an author's note, Pinkney says he ""longed for the story to be more than a cautionary tale or a revenge story."" He gives the the troll a chance to climb out of the water and reflect on what he's done, and perhaps change, and his final art provides readers with clues to what happens. Because the goats initially figure out how to stand up to the nasty troll, the story provides an opportunity for families to talk about bullying and strategies for dealing with it. The art is lush and rich with lots of detail for readers to pore over, making this an excellent version of the tale.

Night of Cake & Puppets: Daughter of Smoke & Bone,Re-release of romantic series companion adds keen art.,"In NIGHT OF CAKE & PUPPETS, Zuzana the puppet maker has a serious crush on Mik, a violinist. She sees him nightly at the Marionette Theater in Prague but can never work up the courage to even introduce herself. Sick of feeling so lovesick, she concocts an outrageously complicated plan to reel him in. It's a scavenger hunt all over snowy Prague with puppets, hints of magic, and a bar filled with upended coffins for tables. Along the way, Zuzana worries about two things: Will Mik want to follow the trail to the end? And if he does, what will she finally say to him when he gets there?
","This artful and hip meet-cute story keenly illustrated by the author's husband is guaranteed to make you long for first kisses and dessert. Readers of the Daughter of Smoke & Bone series who love main character Karou's petite and spunky puppet-maker best friend, Zuzana, are treated to the tale of her blooming romance with Mik the violinist. Her elaborate plans to snare him take readers to the curious corners of Prague. The scavenger hunt will remind art-house movie lovers so much of Amelie. And in both Night of Cake & Puppets and Amelie, the female protagonists have no idea what to do once they have their crush's attention, adding to the delightful romantic tension.
Author Laini Taylor has been one of the strongest writers in young adult literature for a while now. She skillfully and quirkily -- with puppets, of course -- draws out the tension of one night's quest for love and connection in a way that leaves a long-lasting impression. No one describes the lead-up to a kiss quite like she does. With peacock prints in the snow and so much more.","Parents need to know that Night of Cake & Puppets is a companion book in the bestselling Daughter of Smoke & Bone series. It originally came out in 2013 and is re-released in 2017 with illustrations by author Laini Taylor's husband, Jim Di Bartolo. The two also collaborated on the National Book Award finalist Lips Touch Three Times. As in that novel, here much centers on obtaining a kiss. The kissing is described in the author's usual artful style. So is the setting of Prague. Readers will learn a bit about the art of puppetry in the Czech Republic -- some of the puppets featured here are a bit creepy. Characters hang out in a place called Poison Kitchen, which is adorned with gas masks, coffins, skulls, and the like. You don't have to read the whole Daughter of Smoke & Bone series to read Night of Cake & Puppets, but it helps readers understand more about the characters, especially Karou, the main character in Daughter of Smoke & Bone, who appears in the story only in a quick flashback, illustrations, and text messages.

Today I Feel Silly,Fun mood wheel caps this book about feelings.,"A curly-headed little girl shows off her many moods. Each is identified, and examples are presented in rhyme. At the end of the book, a cardboard face with a twirling disk allows kids to adjust eyes and mouth to express whatever mood they're feeling.
","What a wonderful world this would be if we all could identify and accept our feelings and moods -- and TODAY I FEEL SILLY encourages kids to do just that. Though its rhymes may be off at times, the illustrations are amazing and carry the very valuable message that we all have moods and will be happier if we learn to expect and explore them. As the moods of the little girl change, the colors and clutter of each page change, too. When she's feeling silly, bright dramatic colors fill the page; when she feels confused, we have to turn the book sideways to follow the rhymes and illustrations.
The addition of the interactive cardboard face at the end of the book, following the question How do you feel?, is the perfect touch. Kids will enjoy matching the eyes and mouth to their mood. Hopefully, this will help them identify their own feelings, as well as those of people around them.","Parents need to know that this book's illustrations and rhyming text are playful, presenting a comfortable format for discussing emotions with younger children.

Over the course of 40 years, their stories unfold as they raise their daughters in a country quite different from their own. Mothers and daughters learn to navigate relationships as they imperfectly translate one another and the opposing cultures. Seeking to find their identities as women, mothers, daughters, and wives, they find joy in the lives they create.

The novel does not perfectly solve all the problems presented within the pages, but brings hope to the characters as they work to resolve and learn from their relationships.","Parents need to know that The Joy Luck Club weaves the stories of four Chinese immigrant mothers and their four daughters into a richly satisfying novel. The mothers' experiences in China  inform how they bring up their daughters in America, and the girls must figure out how to navigate their own lives, drawing on what they have gleaned from their Old World mothers and their American childhoods.

A Prayer for Owen Meany,"Affecting, darkly comic novel has heavy, mature themes.","John Wheelwright and Owen Meany are best friends growing up in smalltown New Hampshire. As a Wheelwright, John was born into the town's elite, with all the entitlements that come with a prestigious name and notable ancestors. Owen's the only son of distant, financially strapped parents in the granite quarry business. But despite his diminutive size and ""wrecked"" voice, Owen's magnetism, brilliance, and self-assurance make him stand out as something truly special. As John and Owen move through life together, facing death and tragedy, controversy and spirituality, Owen has a deep impact on everyone he meets. And as he grapples with his faith while challenging the conventions of church, school, and country, his fate becomes clear -- and he refuses to turn his back on it.
"," A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY is a dense and darkly comedic novel that has heavy themes and explores serious issues. But it's also incredibly affecting and relatable. The characters are brilliantly crafted and the dialogue is so rich that it's easy to get swept into the story and feel every plot twist and downturn along the way. Irving's ability to lace heavy subject matter -- like war, religion, and tragedy -- into the tribulations of endearing and flawed characters makes for truly a distinctive story.
A Prayer for Owen Meany is an emotional investment, but it's satisfying from start-to-finish. It's ludicrous and heartbreaking, hilarious and horrifying -- and ultimately unforgettable.
 ","Parents need to know that A Prayer for Owen Meany, American novelist John Irving's seventh novel, is about two childhood friends whose lives intersect with class, war, family, and faith. There are lots of mature themes in this darkly comedic read, particularly about politics, war, and religion, and there is some candid sex talk. There's drinking and smoking, sometimes to excess, destruction of property, causalities of war, and class issues. Though it's dense and challenging at times, A Prayer for Owen Meany is also a deeply affecting story with unforgettable characters and thought-provoking themes.

The Cool Bean,"Sweet, whimsical tale encourages empathy and kindness.","The story begins as an adorably nerdy chickpea introduces ""the cool beans"" -- friends with whom he's grown apart over the last year. He misses them, but he doesn't know what to do. He tries to be cool like them with sunglasses (too big), a slick hairdo (too slick), and adopting a swagger (that makes him trip). He still gets picked last, snorts when he laughs, and runs into things -- he declares himself an uncool ""has-bean."" He thinks this is just the way it's going to be until his very bad day is made pretty darn good by the empathy shown to him by his old friends. The ""uncool"" bean learns the secret to being cool -- nd to being a good friend.  ","This witty story, full of wonderful messages about the importance of friendship, compassion, and helping others, is a joy to read with little ones. Preschoolers will delight in The Cool Bean's hilarious pictures, older kids will relate to the story, and parents will appreciate author Jory John's lighthearted approach to teaching values nd giggle at Pete Oswald's bean puns. The uncluttered spreads featuring sunglass-clad, guitar-playing, superhero-drawing beans reveal Oswald's skill at bringing out tons of personality in his bland subjects.
 One small critique is that there's no apology from the cool beans for leaving out their old friend or reason given for why the cool beans choose that particular day to be kind and inclusive; some kids may wonder about this. Still, readers of all ages will adore this fun, heartfelt book.","Parents need to know that The Cool Bean is by Jory John nd illustrator Pete Oswald, the duo behind the best-selling picture books The Bad Seed and The Good Egg. This funny, whimsical story emphasizes positive messages about compassion, empathy, and friendship in a little-kid-friendly way. The narrator is an uncool bean, who misses his friends from the olden days (last year), who have become the cool beans, with awesome shades, fly clothes, and sweet swaggers. The cool beans don't pay their old friend much attention, until a really bad day, when they come to his aid. The way the cool beans emerge as role models offers a great opportunity to talk to young readers about the importance of being kind and helping, not hurting or excluding, others.

Bass Ackwards and Belly Up,Girls take a year off for plenty of iffy behavior.,"Four best friends -- Harper (the writer), Sophie (the actress), Kate (the Harvard-bound perfectionist), and Becca (the shy downhill skier) -- are parting as they head to different colleges. Ashamed to admit she was rejected by the only school she applied to, Harper announces she is skipping freshman year to write a novel. Then Sophie decides to move to L.A. and Kate commits to traveling abroad. Becca, the only friend who decides higher education is still part of her dream, faces her own difficulties with a mean ski coach and cute football player. Documents such as emails, packing lists, and college acceptance letters punctuate the narrative, which jumps amongst the four girls' perspectives.
","Teens who wonder why they're going to college when they have no idea what they want to do with their lives may identify with the characters' desire to travel or try a career first. The book doesn't offer easy success, though, as Harper struggles with her literary aspirations and Sophie waits tables while auditioning for commercials. Girls with their own BFFs will appreciate the foursome's strong bonds, even while miles apart.
However, despite cribbing an obvious page from Ann Brashares' superior The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, Bass Ackwards doesn't recreate Sisterhood's magic with its four main characters. That's because Sisterhood's charm stemmed from its relatable characters, while Bass Ackwards expects readers to identify with self-absorbed, gorgeous high school grads who whine because they have to go to Harvard. Sophie is especially grating as she expects worship by all men, including the movie star she's dating after a month in L.A. Their actions often seem contrary to their personalities, and the men in their lives are unusually eager to put up with their shenanigans.","Parents need to know that this book follows three best friends as they ""commit the ultimate suburban sin"" and forgo college in favor of a gap year. (A fourth friend sticks with higher education, mainly to be on the ski team.) There is a strong emphasis on looks and fashion, with many mentions of high-end brands such as Seven jeans. Product references are ubiquitous; for example, characters don't drink bottled water; they drink Fiji water. One young woman has a one-night stand but this is presented as OK because ""for whatever reason, she felt safe"" with him. A character confronts her fears after being mugged and beaten.

Paper Wishes,"Sad, soulful story of grieving girl interned during WWII.","After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Manami and her Japanese-American neighbors are ordered to leave their homes on Bainbridge Island near Seattle and relocate to a dusty ""prison-village."" A friend plans to take in her dog, Yujiin, but Manami tries to sneak him under her coat. Yujiin is discovered and taken from her on the mainland. Wracked with guilt for leaving Yujiin alone and feeling terribly homesick, Manami stops talking. An understanding teacher supplies her with paper and pencils, and Manami puts her thoughts to paper with pictures of home, the ocean, and Yujiin. She writes wishes for Yujiin to find her, but other dogs come to camp instead. While her wishes remain unanswered, Manami must decide whether to stay paralyzed or find a way to move on.
","This gentle novel lays bare the heartbreak of Japanese-Americans during World War II. It's both an illuminating look at a terrible time in U.S. history and a meditation on loss, grief, and healing. PAPER WISHES doesn't shrink from painful emotions: There are no easy answers or happy-ever-after endings here, but the light that emerges from the gloom shines brightly.
In her debut novel, Lois Sepahban writes with a rhythmic, poetic voice. Spare sentences echo the desolation of the Manzanar camp and Manami's spirit. She and her grandfather have an especially tender understanding through their shared grief for Yujiin and home, as well as his mourning for his late wife. Manami has great strength, even in her sorrow -- her deeply affecting story will stay with readers long after they finish this insightful novel.","Parents need to know that Paper Wishes is about a girl so traumatized by grief and guilt when her family is forced from their home that she goes mute. It follows the government's relocation of Japanese-American families to internment camps and probes themes of loss, healing, endurance, justice, and hope. Danger and violence skulk around the edges -- armed soldiers, reports of a deadly riot, and persistent uncertainty and unease -- but the story is tightly focused on the bonds between 10-year-old Manami and those closest to her.

"Starsight: Skyward, Book 2",New alien allies up the ante in engrossing sci-fi series.,"As STARSIGHT opens, Sansa is ready to embark on an expedition into enemy territory. Cloaked in a holographic disguise, she poses as an aggressive new recruit and is tasked with stealing a ship with a hyperdrive, her compatriots' only hope for survival. Sansa's alien allies seem to share a common enemy, but there are factions working at cross purposes. With her main friend -- the Artificial Intelligence known as M-Bot -- out of commission, will she be able to face her greatest fears and deliver the life-saving technology?
","Space battles don't always work well in prose, but this sci-fi adventure adds a human dimension that will keep the pages turning. Author Brandon Sanderson knows to build a futuristic world that's logical, compelling, and sometimes surprising. Teen starship pilot Sansa is an engaging protagonist: gutsy and determined, if more than a bit stubborn and quick to make snap judgments. The supporting cast is diverse and interesting, and the new alien species contribute some welcome variety to the proceedings. Especially fun is M-Bot, who struggles with how to become human.
The rare second installment that matches the novelty of a saga's first volume, Starsight offers plenty of action, humor, intrigue, and revealing character moments.The book ends with a cliff-hanger, but Sanderson has the stamina to deliver the next book in the series quickly. Readers who enjoy Ender's Game wil likely appreciate Starsight nd look forward to the saga's next installment.","Parents need to know that Starsight is a futuristic space adventure focused on the training of fighter pilots. Written by Brandon Sanderson (Steelheart), it's the second volume in the series, and manages to take the adventure to a higher level.

Otis and Will Discover the Deep: The Record-Setting Dive of the Bathysphere,Exciting story of launching 1930 deep-sea diving tank.,"OTIS AND WILL DISCOVER THE DEEP: THE RECORD-SETTING DIVE OF THE BATHYSPHERE begins by showing Otis and Will as curious, scientifically minded boys: Otis putting together a wooden helmet and hose so he could explore underwater and studying machines in college to become an engineer; Will tracking woodland nimals and growing up to become an explorer and director of research for the Bronx Zoo. They eventually meet and collaborate on designing a diving tank -- a hollow metal ball called the Bathysphere -- to explore the never-before-seen deep ocean. The story chronicles the preparation and launch of the tank, the tense first dive the two made, and the amazing sights they saw through the tank's round windows.
","This exciting, suspenseful ccount of the Bathysphere's first deep-ocean dive vividly conveys the thrill of scientific discovery and celebrates the passion and drive of the diving tank's two creators. Barb Rosenstock's text is gripping and informative, and Katherine Roy's you-are-there watercolor illustrations plunge readers into the story, pulling them along through the briny deep, as fish, eels, squid, jellyfish, and then-unnamed species swim by. She uses warm earth tones on land and cool blues and greens under the sea, while endpapers highlight and label selected fish and creatures. An author's note includes archival photographs of the two men and the Bathysphere. And a fascinating illustrator's note recounts the lengths to which Roy went, imagining and simulating what it was like for Otis and Will, two 6-foot-tall men, to be cramped in their tiny 4.5-foot-wide sphere. ","Parents need to know that Otis and Will Discover the Deep: The Record-Setting Dive of the Bathysphere, by Barb Rosenstock, is a nonfiction picture book that tells the story of an engineer and an explorer who teamed up to build and man  hollow metal diving tank in 1930.

Illustrator Katherine Roy (How to Be an Elephant, Neighborhood Sharks) brings the action-packed text to life, showing how exciting -- and risky -- scientific discovery can be.

"Into the Dorkness: Galaxy's Most Wanted, Book 2","Science-nerd tweens battle aliens in fast-paced, fun sequel.","Evil aliens bent on conquering Earth have landed in the woods of Oregon, and the only thing keeping them from world domination and enslaving the human race may be four brave tweens at a science camp. Picking up right where the original Galaxy’s Most Wanted book left off, our four admittedly nerdy tween protagonists are frantically dealing with the consequences of having inadvertently attracted the aliens to the planet through an invention they created at their camp. Now, with the help of a miniaturized (good) alien robot named Klyk, they must outwit and defeat alien leaders Zouric and Nuzz, their reptilian army (known as Kamilions), and a new threat: swarms of hummingbird-size lien mosquito-robots whose bite turns humans into pliant slaves. In fact, that’s precisely what has already happened to the entire girls' soccer camp across the lake. But the aliens don't know what they're up against when Kevin Brewer and his pals put their heads together to try to figure out a way to send their galactic foes back to distant nebulae. If they could just hijack the alien spaceship for a while …
","As with the first book in the series, Into the Dorkness is fast-paced, funny, and cleverly written. Author John Kloepfer never lets up on the action nd doesn't let the improbability of any plot point or crazy invention deter him from moving the story forward at a breakneck pace. There are a couple of nice twists, including one involving the mysterious creator of a sci-fi comic book that's suspiciously prescient about events in the story, and the pseudo-science is always a hoot.
The four heroes (including strong girl Tara) all are distinctive and appealing in different ways, and the author again demonstrates a wonderful ear for the way kids talk and relate to each other. As in the first book, this one ends on a cliffhanger, though it has a more satisfying conclusion.","Parents need to know that Galaxy’s Most Wanted 2: Into the Dorkness is the fun and action-packed second book in a series about tweens at an Oregon summer science camp who inadvertently create an invention that attracts evil aliens to their remote wilderness. Whereas the first book dealt heavily with how the four  protagonists competed and interacted with their fellow campers, all the while trying to hide the discovery of an alien spacecraft (and its inhabitants) from the other kids and counselors, this one's entirely about how the ingenious tweens band together to defeat the space creatures and their reptile-like army, who are bent on enslaving the entire human race. There's cartoon violence involving zapping rays and large, mosquito-like robots who inject a serum into people to turn them into zombie-like slaves, but nothing graphic or scary. There also re literal cartoons: The book is lavishly illustrated throughout with Nick Edwards' comics-style depictions of all the action, an added bonus for reluctant readers (and a treat for everyone else). Author John Kloepfer is the man behind the blockbuster Zombie Chasers series, too, so he obviously knows the tween audience well. He also knows how to leave readers wanting more -- to be delivered in Galaxy’s Most Wanted 3.

Martha Speaks: Shelter Dog Blues,"Lively talking-dog adventure fosters vocabulary, compassion.","Martha thinks she's got it pretty bad when she's forced to take a bath. But when her collar falls out the window and Martha darts after it, finding herself out on the streets and ultimately in the animal shelter, she realizes her definition of ""bad"" might have been a little bit premature. Making friends with the other shelter pets, she realizes just how lucky she is -- if only she can find her family again and tell them!
","With its comedy-of-errors humor and vibrant, cartoonish watercolor-and-ink drawings, this fun book engages and informs readers, offering lessons in gratitude, kindness, positivity -- and vocabulary. Martha the dog finds herself in all kinds of silly binds, usually of her own doing, but through her learning process, readers, too, learn how to navigate the world and act with decency.
Kids who like dogs will love imagining the possibilities of a talking dog, and parents can appreciate the intelligence and compassion displayed in these fun books. Bonus features include a vocabulary quiz at the end and tips on pet adoption.","Parents need to know that Martha Speaks: Shelter Dog Blues, part of the Martha Speaks series of chapter books, involves a pet who gets lost and ends up in a shelter. The experience is ultimately positive, but more appropriate for kids who already understand (or are ready for) the idea of pets being abandoned or running away, and the shelter and adoption process. Also, the Kindle version has a formatting issue -- the illustrations include text, as they would in a picture book, then that same text appears again on the following page in a different font, presumably to acquaint kids with the typical display of text in chapter books.

Inkheart,Lengthy but rich fantasy great for book-loving tweens.,"Meggie's life with her father Mo, a bookbinder, is disrupted when a mysterious scarred man named Dustfinger appears at their home. Soon she discovers that her father has the ability to read things and even characters out of books. But this ability is a curse -- when someone comes out of a book, someone else from our world goes into the book, and this, Meggie learns, is how she lost her mother many years ago. Now the villain, Capricorn, whom Mo accidentally released from a book called Inkheart, is determined to capture Mo, Meggie, and the book, and force Mo to read both treasure and an evil creature out of the book, using Meggie as his hostage. Betrayed by Dustfinger and on the run from Capricorn, they travel across Europe to find the author of Inkheart.
","As with Cornelia Funke's previous book, The Thief Lord, some kids will be put off by the leisurely pace of INKHEART, while others will be enthralled by the unusual story. But despite the slow pacing and repetition, this is a rousing adventure. Meggie is a stalwart heroine, and the villains are truly creepy and brutal (perhaps too much so for some children). Each chapter begins with a quote from another children's book, both foreshadowing the chapter and giving pleasure to bibliophiles. The whole thing is a paean to books, authors, reading, and especially reading aloud.","Parents need to know that, while this is fantasy, the villains are really quite wicked, and Meggie is often in mortal danger. There's an edge to the villainy here that some kids find enthralling, others disturbing. Book-loving kids and their parents will enjoy the literary references and celebration of books in the lives of the heroes.

Ghosts of Greenglass House,"Engaging, spooky sequel has lots of charm and chills.","GHOSTS OF GREENGLASS HOUSE begins a year after the events of the first book, Greenglass House. Once again, school's out for the winter break, Christmas is only a few days away, and the infamous inn where Milo and his parents live is overrun with guests during what should be their off season. Milo's glad that two of the guests, Clem and Georgie, are actually friends, which makes it not so bad for someone who prefers quiet and solitude. But it soon becomes clear that Clem and Georgie aren't actually on a bachelorette-party getaway. The more Milo learns about what they're really up to, the surer he becomes that at least some of the oddball carolers stranded at Greenglass House are after the same things Clem and Georgie are after. To discover the truth, find the map and the artifacts, unmask the villain or villains, and figure out who's telling the truth about who they are, Milo's going to need the help of more than one ghost.
","Mystery fans who enjoy a few chills on the side will love curling up over winter break, or any time, with this charming story and its colorful cast of oddball characters. The folklore and locations in Ghosts of Greenglass House are richly imagined and so vividly evoked you might be tempted to search online to see if Nagspeake is real. Now author Kate Milford has reunited ll of these elements, which made the first book such a delight.
Like the first, this second book would be great for reading aloud, but tweens who love mysteries and are strong, independent readers will enjoy reading it themselves, too. The ending is satisfying, although fans might wish for more of a cliffhanger as the promise of more to come from Greenglass House. As it is, they'll just have to keep listening for the bell to announce the next adventure.","Parents need to know that Kate Milford's Ghosts of Greenglass House is a sequel to the popular Greenglass House. Reading the first book isn't strictly necessary, but it'll help create a mental picture of the house and some of the recurring characters. Friendly, helpful ghosts, the supernatural, eerie atmospheres, nd spooky animal skulls with antlers appear throughout. Violence is mild, with a couple of people getting hit or knocked out. Guns are brandished nd a fantasy creature kicks someone to the ground. Strong language is very rare but includes ""damned"" once and ""crap"" a few times. There's some mild flirtation among adults, and a kiss is physically rejected. Adults drink alcohol and talk about cocktails. A man is knocked out by spiked punch that's suspected of being poisoned. Best for tweens and up who are strong, independent readers and who enjoy a chilling, spooky mystery.

"Snow Like Ashes: Snow Like Ashes, Book 1",Compelling fantasy world has some storytelling hiccups.,"Meira wants to help save the kingdom of Winter more than anything. She's been hiding out with seven others, including their future king, Mather, for 16 years. They are the only Winterians not enslaved by Spring's evil King Angra and the only ones who have a chance to reclaim a magical amulet Angra stole and split in two pieces. When they finally have a lead on where one half of this source of Winter's lost power may be, Meira's mentor Sir William intends to send someone else to sneak into Spring and retrieve it. Meira begs to go and Sir William eventually allows her to prove herself. After a run-in with Angra's captain of the guard, she runs away with the magical prize. But there's no time to celebrate her success. Meira has been followed back to their secret camp. Before reinforcements come, they split off and make for the kingdom of Cordell seeking help in their fight against Spring. In Cordell they find their support of the Winterians comes at a hefty price, one that Meira is not sure she's willing to pay.
","Weaving in magical realms, a race of people nearly lost, and a teen girl's struggle to matter in the fight to save them, this fantasy tale is compelling -- when it holds together. Once readers are roped into the story, they may be forgiving about the less-than-careful way it's constructed. The small problems run the gamut: some hasty explanations of both major revelations and the details on how this magical world works, some poorly set scenes where you wonder who's where and what's happening. And then there's the dropped romantic plot line. It's fine in one way -- let the romance happen in Book 2 -- but in another it reduces once-important characters to very minor ones by the end of the book.
All those smaller quibbles aside, SNOW LIKE ASHES builds a world many readers will enjoy exploring for a whole trilogy. For more romantic-minded readers, the possibility of a monarch love triangle will be all it takes. For others, the complexity of alliances between Winter and Cordell and the mystery behind the dark magic and how to vanquish it for good will pull them effortlessly into Book 2.","Parents need to know that Sara Raasch's Snow Like Ashes is the first book in a trilogy of the same name. It takes place 16 years after a kingdom called Winter is decimated by the kingdom of Spring. Except for a teen named Meira and seven others, all other white-haired, blue-eyed Winterians live in labor camps -- many of them worked to death or dying there. So with this heavy topic of ethnic cleansing and some other intense violence -- rather bloody battle scenes, a scene of an attempted sexual assault, magical torture where ribs are broken and healed repeatedly -- this fantasy read is definitely for the mature teen crowd. The romantic angle is much milder than the rest of the content. Meira struggles less with two potential suitors (whom she only kisses briefly) than she does with her sense of duty to her country and how she can matter to her people in a meaningful way.

"The Terrible Two, Book 1","Zany fun, great writing in smart prankster tale with heart.","Miles is miserable about moving to Yawnee Valley, remarkable only for its enthusiasm for cows. Miles was the best prankster ever at his old school, and he aims to be the best one at his new school. But as soon as he sees the principal's car at the top of the stairs, blocking the school entrance, it immediately becomes clear this school already has a prankster -- a very, very good one. Miles sets out to make a name for himself, but his rival thwarts him at every turn. Making matters worse, purple-faced Principal Barkin blames Miles for the other prankster's mischief, and the principal's son decides Miles is a great target for bullying. Soon Miles has a choice: Team up with his adversary, or try to go it alone.
","THE TERRIBLE TWO is an uproariously funny start to a new series for middle-grade readers. Miles and Niles are geeky heroes for the overlooked, underestimated, and pigeonholed, approaching their prank projects with admirable righteousness and professional pride. Everything about this book is over the top, from the 1,346 interesting things you may or may not know about cows to the great Cody Burr-Tyler prank and the five generations of Principal Barkins.
Beneath the hilarity, however, is a tender streak: a new kid who wants to fit in, a misfit who opts to make the most of his outsider role, and an authority figure both inspired and burdened by family expectations. Working seamlessly together, Mac Barnett nd Jory John write with dry humor and insight into the world of schoolchildren. The pranks are inspired and genuinely fun (and not easy to replicate at home). Kevin Cornell's energetic illustrations are fabulous, particularly when they feature the balding, sharp-nosed, power-crazed principal.","Parents need to know that The Terrible Two is a terrific collaboration from Mac Barnett (Extra Yarn), Jory John (All My Friends Are Dead), and Kevin Cornell (Count the Monkeys). No need to worry about aspiring pranksters getting too many ideas: Not only are the pranks absurdly over the top, but also the boys hew to a code of conduct that rejects doing any real damage. They do maintain, however, that their targets ""have it coming,"" and they don't face consequences (other than Miles' mortification when he's upstaged). The poor principal is wonderfully absurd in his ambition and logic, with a few sympathetic notes.

A Christmas-tastic Carol,"Dickens perennial gets goofy ""Adventure Time"" treatment.","Ice King, assuming the role of Ebenezer Scrooge, has a frigid heart ""full of Christmas hate!"" Rejecting the cheer of his penguin minions, he decides to sleep through Christmas, ""snuggled up in his icy cold robes."" In his restless slumber that follows, he's visited by three ghosts. Marceline the Vampire Queen as the Ghost of Christmas Past shows him a scene from his distant past before the crown that gave him his magical powers rotted his mind and turned him evil. Lumpy Space Princess (colloquially referred to as LSP) stops by for an appropriately sarcastic turn as the Ghost of Christmas Present, revealing a Tiny Tim-esque BMO suffering from the robot flu. Finally, he's tormented by a cloaked Finn and Jake, who show him a ghastly future in which the people of Ooo are glad to be rid of him. Anyone familiar with the story of Dickens' A Christmas Carol knows what happens when he awakes the next morning, but suffice it to say there's ""a lumping Christmas miracle"" in the end.
","Fans of the animated TV show Adventure Time will certainly chuckle at the appearance of their favorite characters, and Emily Warren's illustrations are captivating and surprisingly dynamic. For a rhyming book written in verse, some of the poetry is a little suspect, but kids won't care. And it's almost as silly and goofy as the show.
A Christmas Carol is a classic for a reason, and this version is certainly serviceable, even if it's not quite as absurd and outrageous as die-hard fans of the show might expect. The gorgeous renderings of the Candy Kingdom and the unique takes on our usually glossy cartoon heroes are more than reason enough to make this a great gift for any Adventure Time devotee.","Parents need to know that A Christmas-tastic Carol is a fun and lighthearted adaptation of the Dickens holiday classic A Christmas Carol, featuring the characters from Cartoon Network's wacky and brilliant animated series Adventure Time. The Ice King's a stand-in for Scrooge, and BMO is in the Tiny Tim role, sick with the robot flu. Perfect for kid, teen, and adult fans of the show.

Valensteins,Monsters learn about love in funny Valentine's Day tale.,"In VALENSTEINS, characters from Ethan Long's Fright Club -- Vladimir the vampire, a witch, a mummy, a ghost, and a werewolf, plus  bunny, a turtle, and a squirrel -- are assembled in their tree house when they notice the big green-faced, flat-topped Fran K. Stein cutting something out of pink construction paper. The mummy holds it upside down and says, ""It  looks like  paper butt!"" Then Bunny turns it right side up and says, ""This is a heart, everyone! When you love someone, you cut one of these out and and give it to them on Valentine's Day!"" The witch looks shocked and asks, ""Do you think Fran ... gulp ... is in LOVE?"" They all scream, ""EEK!"" Then the ghost asks, ""What's LOVE?"" Bunny explains, ""That's when two people feel all mushy mushy about each other."" ""Ewww!"" cry the monsters. Bunny goes on: ""But here's the crazy part! When they get really, really in love ... they ... they ... THEY KISS ON THE LIPS!"" The crowd shouts, ""EEEEWWW!"" Then Fran goes outside and sits on a tree branch holding his pink heart. He sees a tall-haired girl who looks like the Bride of Frankenstein picking flowers, who climbs up and joins him on the branch. ""And that's when he was reminded that love isn't about being mushy mushy or fluttering your eyes or kissing someone on the lips ... and it certainly isn't about cutting out paper hearts,"" says the unseen narrator. ""It's about something you feel in your real heart, even if it does feel a little funny sometimes."" ","This not-spooky but monster-filled love story is a fun alternative to typical Valentine's Day fare. Valensteins gets to the true meaning of the holiday (it's about love, not just expressions of love) in a kid-friendly way that acknowledges that little ones find some lovey-dovey stuff kind of gross. The text and the wonderful cartoon-like illustrations in a spooky, mainly gray and black palette -- with the occasional green face or pink heart -- work perfectly together. It's a howling good time. ","Parents need to know that Ethan Long's Valensteins is a funny Valentine story starring monsters from his Halloween-themed book Fright Club. The sweethearts here are Fran K. Stein and a girl who looks  lot like the love interest in The Bride of Frankenstein. Fran is not scary -- he's busy cutting out a pink heart to give his gal. The cartoon-like art is delightful and the humor on point, as a werewolf, vampire, witch, ghost, and mummy all shriek ""EEEEWWW!"" when told that two people in love sometimes kiss on the lips! It's a fresh, fun take on Valentine's Day that little ones will eat up (along with candy hearts).

Dear Evan Hansen: The Novel,"Powerful novel deals with suicide, anxiety, and loneliness.","In DEAR EVAN HANSEN: THE NOVEL, high school senior Evan Hansen suffers from anxiety and knows what it's like to feel invisible and alone. But when a letter he wrote for his therapy session unexpectedly pulls him into the Murphy family's grief over the loss of their son, Connor, Evan finally gets the chance to know what it's like to belong. All he has to do is pretend that he and Connor were best friends. And while he knows that lying is wrong, can it be that bad if his lies go viral and start to help people beyond his community?

Lions & Liars,"Lively tween camp misadventure has laughs, life lessons.","LIONS & LIARS is the tale of bullied 10-year-old Frederick Frederickson, who, in the social jungle of fifth grade, is not the king of beasts, to put it mildly. In fact, he's the flea on a meerkat's butt, or so his friends tell him. Frederick is counting the hours until his family's Caribbean cruise takes him away from all this and plies him with (nonalcoholic) strawberry daiquiris and chocolate fountains. But then comes Hurricane Hernando, and the trip's off. A series of mishaps involving a boat, a birthday party, and an alligator drops Frederick on the shores of a camp for delinquent boys, where he's mistaken for a hardened miscreant named Dashiell and decides he might like this new identity better. But it doesn't look like they'll be sitting around the campfire having s'mores.

"Between the Spark and the Burn: Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea, Book 2",Conclusion of gothic series about female teen lacks oomph.,"Last summer, Violet White met the charming yet dangerous Redding brothers, River, Brodie and Neely. The trio stayed in her home called, Citizen Kane, located in a small seaside town. After a series events caused romance, heartbreak, and violence, River and Brodie disappeared without a trace. It's been several months, and Violet hasn't heard anything from the brothers. One night, Violet hears of a strange occurrence, on a radio broadcast, in a mountain village miles from her home. She gathers her friends, her brother, and the other Redding sibling, Neely, to go on a mission to locate River and Brodie. Their adventure takes through a myriad of eerie locales, in search of the Redding brothers. On their travels they meet a variety of different characters all searching for the truth behind the mystery of the Redding boys.
","If you thought Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea was gothic and gloomy, get ready for its conclusion in Between the Spark and the Burn. Author April Genevieve Tucholke ups the eerie factor, and the narrative remains lyrical and haunting.

Far Away,"Wild road trip drives emotional story of lies, loss, love.","CJ Ames' mom died right after CJ was born. CJ's Aunt Nic has cared for her lovingly ever since -- and CJ still gets to talk to her mom all the time because Aunt Nic is a medium. But on CJ's 12th birthday, Aunt Nic tells her that her mom's going to a spirit world FAR AWAY -- meaning no more conversations. Determined to find the one physical object from her mom's life that will keep her tied to our world, CJ is soon trying to make sense of assorted signs and portents, which often seem to be leading her (and assorted people along the way) to crazy schemes, as well as places and discoveries better avoided.
","A 12-year-old's life on the tour circuit with her aunt who speaks to the dead is just the jumping-off place for Lisa Graff's imaginative, often funny tale of love, loss, forgiveness, and family. Far Away weaves a tangled web of emotions and things that may or may not be true, where characters do  lot of wrong things for what seem to be the right reasons (and vice versa), and there are surprising plot developments along the way. Then there's bright, strong-willed narrator andmain character CJ herself:
""'I'm teaching you to drive stick,' I say.
""'How do you know how to drive stick?' Jax's knuckles are gripped tight around the steering wheel. 'You're, like, ten.'
""'I'm twelve,' I reply. 'Today's my birthday. And your uncle taught me stick, same as he taught you.' I pause. 'Well, way better than he taught you, obviously. You're not giving it enough clutch.

But there's a lot to love in this tale of young CJ's determination to stay connected with her mom, and how it leads to the discovery that pretty much everything she knows isn't exactly true. Also how everyone involved is dealing with some heavy stuff -- loss, betrayal, anxiety, abandonment, deception -- and mostly doing the best they can with what they've got.

"Fuse: The Pure Trilogy, Book 2",Post-apocalyptic story has great characters; still gruesome.,"As the Pure trilogy continues, Partridge's father is determined to lure him back to the Dome to install him as the new leader. He begins to kidnap orphans, turn them \""pure\"" through operations, and then release them with programmed messages encouraging Partridge to return. He also deploys explosive arachnids he threatens to detonate if Partridge does not turn himself in. Before Partridge turns himself in with the intention of garnering support from rebels within the Dome, he and Lyda get more intimately involved. Meanwhile, Bradwell and Pressia -- who are also getting closer -- are determined to unlock the secrets of the black box and uncover the origins of the Dome and the Detonations.
","While still incredibly compelling and packed with brutal but fascinating images and concepts, Fuse suffers slightly from being the middle book. The title of the second book in the Pure trilogy -- FUSE -- refers both to the objects embedded in the characters' bodies (birds, a doll, a pearl necklace, a child, etc.), as well as the developing physical and emotional relationships between Pressia and Bradwell and Partridge and Lyra. Being a dystopian story, these relationships are fraught with doubt, distance, misunderstandings, and mistakes, but they are at the emotional core of this story, overshadowing the characters' various quests to some degree.
The goal of Pressia and Bradwell's quest isn't always clear, though this also makes Fuse less predictable than cookie-cutter dystopian novels. The world these characters inhabit is so strange and yet subtly familiar that readers will be eager to move on to the finale and see the various loose ends tied up.","Parents need to know that Fuse is the second book in the Pure trilogy, a post-apocalyptic YA series full of gruesome images and bloody violence. Teen characters are continually being chased or threatened and must defend themselves against explosive bugs, weaponized soldiers, poisoned darts, and mutated animals and humans. The central characters have strong morals and risk their own safety for others. In one key scene a teen boy and girl have sex, though the female character doesn't fully understand what the act entails; she gets pregnant. Characters swear throughout (""hell,"" ""goddamn,"" ""ass,"" one or two uses of ""s--t""), although it never feels excessive.

Layoverland,"Teen searches for truth in funny, poignant, afterlife story.","Beatrice, 17, finds herself in LAYOVERLAND fter a fatal car crash. Layoverland is an aiport-like purgatory where the deceased wait for their chance to work through whatever's holding them back from getting into heaven in the first place. Bea's been chosen to be one of the memory guides who help people understand what they need to in order to move on out of there, precisely because helping people is something she rarely did in life. When she's accidentally assigned to help the very person who caused the crash that took her life, Bea's thrown into a tailspin. On the one hand, she wants to prolong Caleb's time in Purgatory and make him as miserable as possible in payback for her own death. On the other hand she wants to know the truth about how or why Caleb caused the crash, at the risk of a revelation about it helping him to get into heaven. Things really get complicated as she starts to realize that she kind of likes Caleb, maybe even more than likes. As her feelings for Caleb grow and change, Bea will have to grapple with life, death, love, hate, hurt, and healing. And only 4,997 more souls to go.
","This dark but very funny novel takes on a lot of life's (and death's) big issues, without getting bogged down in heavy-handed, overly dramatic emotion. Bea's wry, sarcastic but very believable voice gives Layoverland a refreshing counterpoint to digging deep into life, death, love, friendship, family, and, of course, what happens at the end of our time on earth. As does the fact that she's actually not a very good person. But fist-time author Gabby Noone expertly tempers Bea's shortcomings by giving readers the ability to understand and empathize with Bea, and root for her as she starts to see herself and her choices in a new light.
Piecing together the story of the crash by going back and forth between Bea's and Caleb's stories, both leading up to the crash and in Layoverland itself, keep the pages of the well-structured plot turning. There's a certain amount of predictability when it comes to the romance, but the bittersweet ending doesn't just focus on that. A simple act of kindness toward a friend may just have you reaching for a tissue.","Parents need to know that Layoverland is a darkly funny coming-of-age story set in an imagined, in-between afterlife where the deceased await their chance to get into heaven. There's some brief philosophical and spiritual talk about the afterlife in general, what heaven and eternity are like, etc., but religion isn't specifically addressed beyond the traditional Christian heaven-purgatory-hell structure. The story's really about 17-year-old Beatrice's search for the truth about her death in a car crash, her ""post-life"" romance, and learning to see how her behavior and actions affect others. Parental loss is briefly explored via Beatrice's mother, who was killed by a drunk driver when Bea was 5. There are a few kisses described, including one with some detail about tongues. A couple in a bathtub at a party are discovered as they're about to start an unspecified sex act, with mention that the girl has all her clothes on and the boy's pants are pulled down. Teens talk about birth control, abortion (one teen reveals she had one), Planned Parenthood, abstinence, and adoption. Strong language includes ""s--t,"" ""motherf--ker,"" ""bitch,"" and more. Lots of food for thought about the afterlife, eternity, love, friendship, atonement, family, and seeing ourselves as we really are.

Left Drowning,Really racy romance with explicit sex and not much else.,"Blythe has been a drunken and depressed mess since her parents died in a tragic fire four years ago, but when she meets Chris -- and his offbeat but incredibly close brothers and sister -- she begins to be able to remember what actually happened that night, and build a new, healthier life for herself that includes studying, running, and hanging out with friends. But while she and Chris share an incredible attraction, and even hook up one steamy night, he says he's not ready for a relationship with her. Blythe understands he has demons of his own, but she isn't sure he will let her in to his past, even after telling him, \""You saved me. And I wish that you would let me save you.\""
","Well, this isn't full of subtlety or complex characters; readers won't even get a real sense of Blythe, the protagonist, or why everyone seem to think she's so special. Chris' siblings -- including drama geek Sabin, tough-talking Jesus freak Estelle and her sweet gay twin, Eric -- come across as especially two-dimensional.
In the end, this is a book full of descriptive sex scenes, dramatic fights and revelations, and philosophical talk about fate vs. chance -- all held together by some pretty over-the-top plotting. (Because of their pasts, both Blythe and Chris are wealthy, so this drama often takes place in hotel suites or huge houses overlooking water). Really, really mature readers who like racy romances might appreciate that this book does include a positive message: With love and support (and in some cases, therapy), the characters learn to have happy lives despite awful, tragic pasts. ","Parents need to know that Left Drowning features many vivid descriptions of sex, including intercourse, oral sex, masturbation, and more, including a character who wants her boyfriend to hit her during sex. Blythe's parents died in a tragic fire, which she recounts in detail, and Chris details horrific abuse at the hands of his father who both physically and psychologically tortured his siblings and him (he was beaten by a mallet, forced to carry heavy objects, nearly drowned in a toilet, and more). There's plenty of mature language, and lots of drinking until drunkenness, including by the main character (who's of legal drinking age). Another character gets a DUI and later has to go to rehab to get his drinking under control.

"Evermore: The Immortals, Book 1",Twilight lookalike with more sex and profanity.,"Ever Bloom is the only survivor of a car crash that kills her entire family. After the accident, she has regular, in-person conversations with her dead little sister, develops intense psychic powers allowing her to read minds, and see auras. When a super sexy, rich, mysterious student named Damen shows up, Ever cannot see his aura, nor read anyone else's mind when he touches her, either. Who is this guy, and why is Ever drawn to him -- and scared of him -- all at the same time?
","Author Alyson Noel does a great job drawing readers into EVERMORE. The audience will hit it off with strong but vulnerable Ever, and be drawn to the mysterious Damen, much like everyone else is in the book.
However, audiences will grow tired of the constant, incessant references to how hot Damen looks all the time. After Damen arrives we are treated to and beaten over the head with how incredibly attractive this mysterious teen boy appears to everyone -- male, female, adults, teens -- EVERYONE. And the novel's end reveal is a hard swallow, relying on past information readers only learn at the last minute. It feels like a bit of a letdown after what had been an interesting journey. Still, most teens will be willing to overlook these quibbles and surrender to the gripping story -- and its sequels.","Parents need to know that this is the first book in a fantasy series that will appeal to Twilight fans. There are some gruesome scenes, including a girl losing her entire family in a car crash and watching them cross over to the other side. Another teen is murdered, though readers don't see it happen, and two more teens are threatened. Several scenes are quite bloody. There's also some swearing, heavy petting, and one teen develops a drinking problem. Even so, Ever is a relatable character and readers will empathize with her difficulty accepting her new reality. Fantasy fans who enjoy this book will be happy to learn there are several more books in the series and even a spin-off about Ever's dead sister.

"We Rise, We Resist, We Raise Our Voices",Inspiring advice from diverse authors and illustrators.,"WE RISE, WE RESIST, WE RAISE OUR VOICES is a compilation of 30 pieces created by authors and illustrators of different backgrounds, each offering advice, guidance, and reassurance for kids living in turbulent times.
","This encouraging treasury of pieces by diverse writers and illustrators offers concrete advice to kids living in difficult times. Some of the pieces in We Rise, We Resist, We Raise Our Voices focus on very specific issues. Eleanora E. Tate talks about having dark brown skin, and how to rise above people who belittle you. Hena Khan discusses what to do if you're Muslim and people call you a terrorist. One story's narrated by a kid whose father is seized and deported by ICE. Some writers tie events today to historical ones, like slavery or Jim Crow laws, making the point that troubling times have long existed, and others have found ways to resist and usher in positive change.
Some of the most effective pieces address kids directly, as if writer and reader are in cozy conversation. Sharon G. Flake writes a letter to kids and signs it, ""Your fan and cheerleader."" Tonya Bolden urges kids to make small, manageable changes, like ""compliment someone on an outfit or hairdo, congratulate a friend on a victory,"" acts that are easily within a kid's grasp. The message to readers is that they're not alone; the book connects them to larger communities, to elders with experience and good counsel. And it offers hope. As poet Marilyn Nelson tells kids, ""Today's acts of good will change tomorrow ... good is in control, and good will win.""","Parents need to know that We Rise, We Resist, We Raise Our Voices is an anthology of illustrated poems, letters, essays, stories, and even a song by a diverse roster of prominent authors and illustrators. It's edited by Wade and Cheryl Willis Hudson, experienced multicultural publishers, who put the book together to provide kids from vulnerable communities guidance and reassurance during times that might feel uncertain or unsafe. The carefully paired text and art were created by a host of award winners, such as Kwame Alexander, Margarita Engle, James Ransome, and Rita Williams-Garcia, who share their experience and hope. If kids have worries or concerns about how to navigate troubled waters, this book throws them a literary life raft.

Counting Crows,"Unique counting book has simple art, playful text and story.","Readers count crows that land on each page, mostly in threes, searching for snacks to eat: 3, 6, 9, 10, 11, then 12. They find and devour roly-poly bugs, mangoes, peanuts, ants, crackers, and so on. But these are no ordinary crows. Looking a bit like Heckle and Jeckle of cartoon fame, these birds are full of fun and energy. Each one sports a striped red-and-white sweater, and one wears a long red scarf. Not only do they eat, but they also hop, sing, and cackle, until suddenly a cat appears and off they fly, again in groups the reader can count. ","COUNTING CROWS is one of the most entertaining counting books you'll find. The whimsical, energetic illustrations alone are enough to make it a keeper, but unique rhymes coupled with a story that holds it all together make it remarkable. Kids as well as parents will enjoy reading nd playing with the silly crows as they come and go in their search for delectable snacks.
Pages are full of opportunities for counting, matching, multiplying, and subtracting, as well as playing with rhymes and searching for details in the penciled drawings. What fun! ","Parents need to know that Counting Crows is a silly counting book by Newbery finalist and two-time National Book Award nominee Kathi Appelt that involves sweater-clad crows, the food they eat, and a hungry cat. Rob Dunlavey's simple pencil-drawn illustrations digitally rendered are the best part. Boisterous crows in red-and-white-striped sweaters supply energy and fun, and unique rhyming text adds even more joyful excitement. The concept of grouping in threes may be a bit confusing for the youngest readers, but they may not care. Readers of all ages will more likely just enjoy the rhythm and whimsy.

A Hundred Horses,"Magical, emotional adventure story great for tween girls.","Before the events of A HUNDRED HORSES, 11-year-old Nell's father abandoned his wife and child. Now, Nell must attend afterschool classes (which she doesn't like) while mom Cathy works full-time. When Cathy must attend a work-related conference during a school break, she sends Nell to stay with Aunt Liv and younger cousins Gem and Alfie on their farm. There, city kid Nell meets pigs, chickens, and mud. Then she's almost trampled by a galloping horse, whose mysterious rider is involved in unexplained disappearances, and also with the legend of a hundred horses.
","To an adult, A Hundred Horses gets off to a slow, predictable start, with the troubled city girl sent to visit a farm where fresh air and hard work will set her straight. That happens, but there's also a lot of magic and mystery: Angel's story, the legend of the hundred horses, and the connection between humans and animals. As the plot and characters deepen, the story grows more beautiful and uplifting. This emotional book is a marvelous find, especially for girls who love horses.","Parents need to know that Sarah Lean's A Hundred Horses tells the story of 11-year-old Nell, whose mom sends her to live on her aunt's farm during a school break. There she has the expected city-girl-visits-the-country learning experiences, but also befriends Angel, an almost magical girl who radically alters Nell's worldview and her ability to trust. A couple of times there's an apparent threat of harm against a child or farm animal. There are also suspenseful chase scenes and one use of the word ""hell,"" but nothing in this book would upset middle-graders, teens, or their parents. A Hundred Horses emphasizes a loving connection between humans and animals, and the ties that bind members of a family -- biological or otherwise.

The Rabbit and the Turtle,Stellar artist revisits classic read-aloud fables.,"Eleven of Aesop's fables are retold, each in a one-page story followed by its one-line lesson and illustrated with a vibrantly colored collage.
","Bright colors and cleverly detailed collages bring the fables alive, and anyone familiar with the work of Eric Carle will recognize his artwork at once. Aesop's fables have been around for centuries, and most readers have heard various versions of them all, especially the one about the turtle racing the hare. By choosing it as the title of his book, and changing it to THE RABBIT AND THE TURTLE, Eric Carle welcomes the reader into his collection and gives it a comfortably modern tone that echoes throughout the book, not only in the storytelling but in the vivid tissue paper collages that fill the pages.
As in the original version, each story is told in a single page, with a moral tagging along at the end. The language is the language of a storyteller, sophisticated enough to be dramatic and charming, yet easy enough to keep any reader interested. With his signature cut-and-layered hand-painted tissue paper, he has created colorfully intriguing scenes that fill the page opposite each story, capturing the essence of the fable. Each one is a joy to look at as the listener lets the lesson of each tale sink in.","Parents need to know that this collection of Aesop fables, as retold and illustrated by Eric Carle, is entertaining, beautiful, and packed with classic stories with great lessons. The story of the rabbit and the turtle doesn't appear until halfway through, after such fables as ""The Lion and the Mouse,"" ""The Wolf and the Dog,"" ""The Fox and the Crane,"" and so on. Older readers will remember them all, and younger readers will enjoy getting acquainted.

Footprints on the Moon,One boy's view of the Apollo 11 mission.,"A young boy who is fascinated by the moon and outer space spends his evenings staring out his window at the night skies and dreaming about the amazing world out there beyond his reach. He studies maps, collects clippings, plays at being an astronaut, and then, one day, he is lucky enough to watch the Apollo 11 moon landing.
","The title of the book FOOTPRINTS ON THE MOON so appropriately captures the fascination the boy has with the moon, and the effect the Apollo 11 landing had on him. It's the same fascination that anyone living through this time felt as they watched those men walk on the surface of the moon. Something that seemed so unreal was actually made real by the presence of those footprints, and the fact that they still remain makes it all the more amazing.
The boy seems like so many young kids in the '60s who caught the space fervor. His story is told with contagious enthusiasm, in language that is descriptive, in a kid-like way, yet filled with specific details that most space-crazed kids would know. The illustrations are reminiscent of those in the Dick and Jane books, though with a hazy, dream-like overlay that makes this all look like a memory. And, as we learn in the end, that is exactly what it has been for the man who, still fascinated with the moon, has told this story of his youth while staring out his bedroom window at the nighttime sky.","Parents need to know that this story takes place in England, so the time of the moon landing reflects U.K. time rather than that of the United States. Otherwise, the thoughts, dreams, and facts are realistic, and the narrative contains nothing inappropriate.

My Mom Is Trying to Ruin My Life,"Kids will relate to tale of ""embarrassing"" parents.","The narrator of this simple book is pretty tired of all the parenting she's getting. She's had it up to here with her solicitous mother and loving father and she's imagining how to get them off her back, with surprising results.
","This is a cute book, but not much more than that. Most kids will empathize with some aspect of the narrator's plight but others might think she's overreacting. Still, even if kids don't quite get her over-the-top objection to getting mom-kisses in front of friends, they'll surely know what it's like to be denied their junk food of choice. Definitely good for a giggle.
The illustrations are simple but sweet, and grown-ups might catch themselves feeling somehow nostalgic since Mom is dressed more like Donna Reed than any moms wandering supermarket aisles these days.","Parents need to know that this book doesn't make demons of parents or kids but stays silly and loving all the way through.

Henry Works,Henry David Thoreau as a bear.,"Henry the bear is simply walking to work in 19th century Concord, Massachusetts, but a walk with this acute observer is a slow and careful event. To some he appears to be idle. He stops to pick comfrey root, waters some milkweed flowers, collects pine needles, and notices that a fox poses a threat to a friend's chickens.
Along the way, he stops in on neighbors such as Emerson (Ralph Waldo), Mrs. Hawthorne (wife of Nathaniel), and Mrs. Alcott (spouse of Bronson). He helps Emerson with a woodchuck infestation, tells Mrs. Alcott to bring in her drying laundry because it will soon rain, and plants a strawberry plant in Mrs. Hawthorne's garden. This is quite an illustrious set of neighbors, but people are not Henry's focus. He is sharply attuned to the world of plants, trees, and natural phenomena such as the weather. When he arrives at his cabin he begins his work: writing.
","This fourth title in a series continues the saga of a most unlikely picture book subject, Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862), with the same aplomb as its award-winning predecessors. While Thoreau does not appear in an immediately recognizable guise, his quiet containment, clarity of focus, and relationship with the natural world reflect the man perfectly.
D. Johnson's extraordinary Cubist-style artwork and quietly told story reproduce Thoreau's world in a way that is easy to grasp and peaceful enough for bedtime. This is a beautifully rendered tale rich with historical, literary, geographical, and natural history references. Thoreau himself would surely approve of planting the seeds of wisdom in young minds.","Parents need to know that adult readers will recognize that Henry the bear is a fictionalized version of the famous Henry David Thoreau, author of Walden, or, Life in the Woods, and that the bear's experiences reflect those of the 19th century author. Children may not have the historical context, but the appealing artwork and gentle story reproduce Thoreau's world in a way that is easy to grasp. There is a readable map on the end papers to follow Henry's route around Concord.

If I Ran the Zoo,"Dr. Suess imagines a better, brighter, zanier zoo.","Seuss's zoo is better and brighter than the ones we know, with its Joats and Lunks and Mulligatawnies from locales like the Desert of Zind and the Wilds of Nantucket. Young Gerald McGrew imagines the creatures he would put on display, the distant lands where he would track them, and the inventive means he would use to trap them.
 ","IF I RAN THE ZOO is a standard -- and by that meaning the standard -- Seuss joyride of verse and ridiculous creatures. Here is life lived as a fantastical experience, lit by an imagination that shimmers and bursts like fireworks. Though the animals are pure figments, Seuss transports readers into the adventure with Gerald McGrew as he globetrots in search of the best wild animals.
So evocative are the places that an 8-year-old rereading the book after an absence of three years announced ""Russia!"" when a snow-swept, spruce-darkened village of cupolas came into view. But Seuss stumbles as he dishes up some shockingly quaint verbal and visual racial commentary: ""I'll hunt in the mountains of Zomba-ma-Tant / With helpers who all wear their eyes at a slant,"" or the Indian chieftains whom Gerald will display along with the ""scraggle-footed Mulligatawny,"" or the African porters. Now is as good a time as any to have a discussion about this racial typing.","Parents need to know that the cut-up verse skips like a step-dancing troupe, the creatures are crazily imaginative concoctions, and the narrator is amusing -- and enviable.

Septimus Heap Series,"Charming series for kids not ready for big, dark fantasies.","Just after the apparent death of the sprawling, wizardly Heap family's newborn seventh son, they are given a baby girl, Jenna, to care for. Ten years later they are forced to flee their home in the Castle when it turns out the girl is the daughter of the murdered queen, and the Supreme Custodian, who has taken over the city, sends an assassin to complete his destruction of the royal family. Pursued by a professional Hunter, and accompanied by the ExtraOrdinary Wizard, a ghost, and a young soldier known only as Boy 412, they head into the Marram Marshes to find refuge with their Aunt Zelda, the White Witch. But the Necromancer, DomDaniel, who is in league with the Supreme Custodian, is determined to see them all destroyed.
","This author may have slept through the classes in Story Construction and Character Development, but she was the star pupil in Blithe Spirit. With a light touch and gentle humor, she carries readers through this overlong first novel, with some explosions of imagination along the way. A wealth of fascinating magical creatures and an intriguing new design for magic make this a delightful, at times exciting, read.
Septimus, now apprentice to the ExtraOrdinary Wizard, seems to be the only one alarmed with his brother Simon, doing the bidding of Necromancer DomDaniel, rides off with Princess Jenna. He knows she's been kidnapped and goes after her. This installment is just as fun as the first with the same light touch and unique approach to magic. It's nice to see Septimus fleshing out as a character, learning magic, and facing his fears.
 Septimus is kidnapped through a magic glass and taken back 500 years to be the apprentice of alchemist Marcellus Pye. Meanwhile Pye's mother, Queen Etheldredda, haunts the present and attempts to reclaim the crown from Jenna. There are plenty of what-ifs with the time travel theme, but the story bogs down in its length and some of the heart is missing in this installment. Queen Ehteldredda is a fun villain, however.
Thanks to a cruel ghost, Septimus is set up for a quest that no other apprentice has returned from -- but not if he escapes the Questing Guards first. He, Jenn, and his friend Beetle would rather rescue Nikko and Snorri, stranded in the distant past in book 3. It takes almost 300 pages for the trio to hit the road and this book is poorer for it. The focus should have been on their journey, not a slew of minor characters.","Parents need to know that among current fantasy novels, this is among the least dark or violent, and almost uniquely in this genre, fighting and killing are not portrayed as the answer to anything and are assiduously avoided, villains are seen as redeemable, and heroes are both stronger and more compassionate than their enemies. This series' gentleness makes it especially recommended for those not quite ready for the big, dark fantasies.

As the Snow Queen steps up her attacks on the students of Ever After School, families are fleeing to the magical campus. Rory and her fellow warriors are worn out and worried. Making things worse, Chase has become flaky and unreliable just when Rory needs him most. He's so engrossed in a romantic relationship that he's letting down his friends. Rory wants his support as she prepares for her final battle, but instead she finds herself clashing with him s well.
","The action-packed finale to Shelby Bach's four-part Ever Afters series is the strongest in the fun fairy tale series, rich with emotional complexity and maturing relationships.

Rory's relationships with her parents and teachers deepen considerably.

As it turns out, Duck will remind readers of other politicians they might know (right down to heading to the late-night talk shows for better exposure). The illustrations are a good match for the funny, quick-moving text, making this a strong addition to the Farmer Brown series, and a timely one at that.

Normal: One Kid's Extraordinary Journey,"Inspiring, graphic story of boy with facial differences.","In NORMAL: ONE KID'S EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY, authors Magdalena and Nathaniel Newman recount the challenges that Nathaniel experiences, having been born with Treacher Collins syndrome. These challenges, told from both his mother's and his point of view, are described with brutal honesty. Magda recalls thinking, ""This is the worst day of my life,"" when she saw Nathaniel for the first time. Her truthfulness serves as a baseline as she nd her family endure nearly 70 surgeries to help Nathaniel do basic things like breathe, eat, and hear. Nathaniel is pretty immune to the looks and comments that people make when they see him for the first time. He lets it all roll off his back, knowing what real challenges -- nd real friends -- look like. When the book Wonder comes out and then is made into a film, he's asked to play a special role in making the movie realistic. His family continues to advocate for people who are different, making the world a little more ""normal"" for every unique person.
","This is a fascinating and graphic memoir of a family's struggle to live with a child's severe craniofacial impairments. Normal: One Kid's Extraordinary Journey is really two stories -- Nathaniel's lmost impish ccount of his life to date, and a survival story told by his mother, Magda. There are flashbacks to her childhood in Poland and also her struggle with cancer. These sidelines are interesting, but they aren't always relevant to Nathaniel's story or his personal experience. One of the things that makes Nathaniel's story incredible is his ability to accept his situation for what it is. He speaks about not knowing anything other than life as he's lived it. His mother's narrative serves to show how much labor has gone into raising a child with severe challenges. Her point of view is graphically detailed. She's brutally honest with herself and challenges those who don't show compassion. Whether her side of the story is really compelling to kids is questionable. But as real-life superheroes go, Nathaniel has definitely earned his status.","Parents need to know that Normal: One Kid's Extraordinary Journey is a memoir about a boy named Nathaniel Newman who has Treacher Collin's syndrome -- which causes craniofacial differences like the main character in Wonder has -- nd has to endure many surgeries to help him with basic functions like breathing and eating. These functions are described in graphic detail, such as the cleaning his trach tube many times a day (for a dozen years) lest he suffocate. Nathaniel's fed through a tube in his stomach, called a g-tube, which allows him to have food and nutrients put directly into his body. His eyes are sewn shut for a few days after a surgery and his jaws sewn shut for four months. Over his lifetime, he has trouble eating, and there are many descriptions of him vomiting through his mouth or trach tube. He has to wear a halo that has ""screws that need to be tightened daily to slowly expand my bones."" The tightening causes him intense pain, and he bleeds from the screw insertion points. All of this is to say that the medical aspect of the story is graphically rendered, and it's meant to illustrate what Nathaniel has had to go through in order to physically function better. His mother also describes her own health issues, which include details of her battles against cancer. There are near-death experiences and a beloved dog dies.

"The Fairy's Mistake: The Princess Tales, Book 1",A fairy's reward and punishment backfire.,"Rosella helps the fairy, Ethelinda, disguised as an old woman, get a drink of water from the well, and is rewarded by having jewels tumble from her mouth whenever she speaks. Her selfish sister, Myrtle, is punished with bugs and snakes coming out of her mouth. But Ethelinda's plans backfire when Myrtle uses her affliction to force townspeople to give her whatever she wants, while Rosella is married to a greedy prince who only loves her jewels.
","The author's light sense of humor and deadpan descriptions of absurdities, along with the short length and easy-to-read text, make this a delightful snack rather than a heavy meal. But she never talks down to her audience, which makes this a good choice for young readers, reluctant readers, and reading aloud. This is the first of The Princess Tales, a series of short retellings of fairy tales by the Newbery-honored author of Ella Enchanted. Some may find the values here a little questionable: Myrtle's outrageous behavior is never punished, bringing success to her and her nasty mother. She even helps Rosella deceive the prince to get him to behave somewhat better, but he still gets to keep half of the jewels Rosella produces, while she gets to give the rest to the poor. But it's all meant in fun, and it's unlikely any young readers will take Myrtle as their role model.","Parents need to know that the behavior of both sisters is filled with points for discussion, as the bad sister gets what she wants through blackmail, and the good sister marries a man she does not love.

The Boy Who Invented TV: The Story of Philo Farnsworth,True story about an amazing boy who thought outside the box.,"Philo Farnsworth was a remarkably talented boy with a curious mind. From an early age he wanted to know what made things work, and he was surrounded by people who fed his sense of wonder. He worked and studied hard until one day while planting potatoes he came up with an idea that led to the invention of the television. A page at the end explains to older readers just why most people have never heard of his name.
","This is just the kind of story that inspires kids. And, though of an earlier time, Philo has the kind of life most kids can relate to. He is a regular kind of kid who wonders about things, goes to school, reads, and has great ideas. He has chores, responsibilities, and dreams, and  he succeeds in creating his invention, the first television.  
The topic is captivating, and the writing has the informative yet entertaining tone of a master storyteller at work. Without oversimplifying, the narrator imparts the enthusiastic spirit of the boy and passes on a few complicated ideas in an uncomplicated way. The story is meaty enough to hold any reader's interest, and the illustrations are just as inspirational. 
The artwork in this book is as intriguing as the story itself. Done in acrylics and colored pencil, and overlaid with digitally created diagrams and images, the illustrations are nostalgic, imaginative, and informative. Readers will enjoy the drawings of old phonographs and radios as well as the softly edged period scenes and the golden highlights that capture the tone of this boy's amazing story.They may also enjoy trying to figure out the scientific and mathematical drawings in the various backgrounds. ","Parents need to know that this is an inspiring biography about a boy who worked hard, and came up with the idea that led to the invention of the TV.

The Mighty Miss Malone,Unforgettable 12-year-old girl battles the Great Depression.,"In May 1936, 12-year-old Deza Malone may be poor, but she's living a fairly secure, happy life in Gary, Ind., as the brightest student in her class and the beloved child of doting parents. But the Great Depression hits the family hard, first driving her father away from town in search of work, then Deza, her brother, and her mother after him when he disappears. Trouble and hardship follow, in which not only poverty but also racial prejudice play a role -- as does the kindness of strangers.
","Deza is an unforgettable character whose perspective on historical events is by turns entertaining and provocative. Curtis' previous book, Bud, Not Buddy, in which young Deza makes an appearance, won both the Newbery Medal and the Coretta Scott King Award, among other honors, so THE MIGHTY MISS MALONE is in good company. As the story progresses, young readers will have frequent occasion to contemplate what it might have been like, for example, to be in constant pain because half their teeth were rotting away. ","Parents need to know that positive messages abound in this tale of family tenacity in the Great Depression, but some of the misfortunes and hardships that befall the the Malone family are quite harrowing (e.g. losing their home, Mr. Malone's physical and mental deterioration) and may be troubling to more sensitive younger readers. The vivid snapshots of everyday life, main character Deza's exuberant, malapropism-laden love of language and learning, and the sudden dissonance of clashing worlds (say, the world of the Malones, and the world of the banker's family for whom Mrs. Malone cleans house) all add enjoyment, irony and interest to the story for thoughtful readers. There's' also an audiobook version narrated by Bahni Turpin.

Fly by Night,Clever but confusing story needs editing.,"In an alternative version of 18th-century England, Mendelion is ruled in name by a mad Duke, in reality by a group of competing Guilds, and in aspiration by a variety of royal pretenders. Since the Realm was shattered, the king deposed, and the parliamentarians and monarchists locked in struggle, with the Guilds in between, there has never been real peace, and open warfare is just a wrong move away.
\ \ Into this tinderbox comes Mosca Mye, an orphan who has taken up with a smooth-talking con man, both because she loves words, and because she accidentally set her mean uncle's mill on fire. Together they get involved in the power intrigues of the city. But Mosca, though very bright and literate (a rarity in this world), understands a lot less than she thinks she does.
","Frances Hardringe's fertile imagination fills this book with an abundance of complex, deeply thought-out, and at times just plain weird events and characters. Word-loving children will find much here to tickle their fancies.
But Hardringe falls prey to that familiar bugaboo of novice writers -- she tries to pack all her ideas into her first book, and apparently she didn't have an editor who told her to scale it back. The result is a mishmash that will lose many, if not most, young readers early on to boredom, confusion, or incomprehension. But there's tremendous talent here, shown in many real gems of originality and felicitous language. Let's hope that Hardringe gets an editor who will rein her in more sharply next time.","Parents need to know that there's some violence, though not terribly graphic. For much of the book, the main character's ethics are questionable at best, though she does shape up toward the end.

Chicka Chicka Boom Boom,Colorfully illustrated alphabet rhymes.,"How many small letters can fit up the coconut tree? Too many! But the capital letters come to the rescue, and everyone is patched up before sundown. The familiar letters--and the pages of this story--come alive in this colorfully illustrated (but, perhaps too abstract) alphabet rhyme.
","Although the illustrations in this book are a bit abstract (some younger readers didn't recognize the coconut tree until it was pointed out), they are boldly painted. The dazzling rainbow parade of colorful letters make them memorable, adding to the educational value of this rhyming tale. ""Chicka chicka boom boom!"" becomes a fun mantra for children, who shout it out as an ""Uh-oh!"" to warn the adventurous alphabet characters. The illustrations of the patched-up letters are whimsical and endearing.
A great story for children learning (or needing reinforcement in) their letters, the alphabet is listed in order twice during the course of the story.","Parents need to know that kids will be delighted by the characters' tree-climbing antics. Beginning readers and the read-to-me set will enjoy the vibrant art, the bouncy rhymes, the repetition, and the personification of letters.

None of the Above,Informative tale of a girl who learns she's intersex.,"Krissy is a track star and homecoming queen with a popular boyfriend. After a painful first-time sexual experience with her boyfriend, she visits a doctor who suspects Krissy is intersex (or ""what some people call a hermaphrodite""). She doesn't have a uterus nd quickly decides to have surgery when she learns she has gonads. She tells her two best friends about her diagnosis at a party, and suddenly rumors are flying all over school: Her locker is vandalized, her boyfriend breaks up with her, and her coach says she can't run on the track team until there's an investigation to make sure she can compete in the girl's division. Will nybody be able to accept her -- and will she be able to accept herself?
","NONE OF THE ABOVE follows a pretty typical ""problem novel"" formula, and readers might find it more educational than entertaining. But the book does provide solid information about what it means to be intersex, and it will challenge teens to think about some pretty big questions, such as: What does it mean to be a girl or a boy -- and why do only those two categories exist?
There are now lots of books about gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transsexual characters that make readers think about gender and sexuality; author I.W. Gregorio -- a surgeon who's worked with a young patient with Krissy's diagnosis -- should be applauded for widening the tent even further. ","Parents need to know None of the Above is a novel that educates teen readers about what it means to be intersex, as the protagonist, Krissy, was born with both male and female characteristics. Krissy is bullied both online and at school, and people say hateful things to nd about her. She's attacked at a club by a man when he realizes that she's the intersex teen he's heard about. There's some swearing and drinking, as well as some frank sex talk: After Krissy has very painful sex with her boyfriend, she meets with doctors and they discuss body parts, menstruation, hormones, and dilation kits to help her grow her very short vagina. She has to have surgery to remove her gonads. Krissy has a supportive single father and a good friend she meets through a support group. She eventually learns to stop letting ""other people define who -- and what --"" she is. The author provides additional resources (books and websites) for teen readers to check out.

Dad and the Dinosaur,Dad helps son manage fears in kind story full of empathy.,"DAD AND THE DINOSAUR BEGINS by contrasting a boy and his dad: ""Nicholas was afraid of the dark outside his door, the bushes where the giant bugs lived, and the undersides of manhole covers. His dad was not afraid of anything."" When he has his toy dinosaur with him (it's small enough to fit in a pocket or in his soccer sock), ""Little Nick"" feels as brave as ""Big Nick."" But after he loses it during a soccer match, he's gripped by fear on the drive home, imagining giant bugs in the street and and a black octopus-like creature reaching for their car from under a manhole cover. Late that night, his dad comforts him by saying, ""It's okay to be afraid. All guys are now and then."" Then he takes Nick back to the field to find the dinosaur that helps him feel braver.
","This gentle story of a fearful boy and his loving, understanding dad is both relatable and engaging, with wonderful art that helps readers understand the main character's feelings. Author Gennifer Choldenko's text shows Nick's dad respecting Nick's feelings and not telling him just to suck it up, like some parents might. Dan Santat's imaginative illustrations depict not only Nick's fears but also how he imagines a real giant dino helping him climb a rock wall, send a soccer ball over a tough goalie's hands, and help him sleep at night. Dad and the Dinosaur is great for opening up a discussion about common fears and how sharing your secrets, fears, and feelings with someone you trust can help you feel better. ","Parents need to know that Dad and the Dinosaur, by Newbery Honor-winning author Gennifer Choldenko (Al Capone Does My Shirts) and illustrated by Caldecott Medal-winning illustrator Dan Santat (Beekle, Are We There Yet?), tells the story of a fearful boy who feels braver when he has his tiny toy dinosaur with him. After he loses it while playing in a soccer match, he gets very anxious. But his understanding dad acknowledges his son's feelings and helps him find the beloved dino again. This is a sensitive and entertaining story full lof empathy that's a great choice for parents looking to help kids deal with fears.

Split Screen: Attack of the Soul-Sucking Brain Zombies / Bride of the Soul-Sucking Brain Zombies,Fun format adds creativity to gay-themed coming-of-age book.,"In this follow-up to Hartinger's Geography Club, two gay friends -- a guy and a girl -- decide to work as extras on a zombie movie being filmed in their town. In Min's story, she falls for a girl who is still in the closet and must decide if she is willing to keep a secret. In Russel's, his long-distance relationship is threatened when his popular ex-boyfriend decides he wants him back. Will they be able to solve their romantic drama before the movie wraps? Perhaps, with a little help from their personal support networks -- and each other.
","This is a fun way to read a book: Once you're done with Russel's story, you can flip the book over and read Min's. Teens will have a good time piecing together what really happened, even when each protagonist has a different perspective. But beyond the entertaining premise, readers may find themselves truly moved at moments, such as when Russel talks about how frightening it is to grow up gay (""most of us gay people grow up surrounded by people who we know don't understand us and who, if they knew the truth, might very well completely reject us"").
This is more than an identity book about gay characters -- the protagonists here also learn important lessons about learning to see the complexity of real life, and real people, from dealing with parents to handling first loves.","Parents need to know that this is really two books in one (teens flip it over to read the parallel story). Each book is narrated by a gay character (Russel is a gay boy and Min is bisexual girl) as they try to figure out their romantic relationships. There is some same-sex kissing. Russel, thinking he sees his ex-boyfriend in another man's arms, accuses him of ""picking up old guys in parks."" Russel also stays out until 5 a.m. with a boyfriend, making ""the most of our time together."" Min's parents are OK with her sexuality, while Russel's mother says ""homosexuality is disgusting.""

It turns out to be the Infundibulum, the most valuable object in the universe, a map of all parallel earths. Everett follows his father's trail into another universe, one where the villainous Charlotte Villiers and her creepy henchmen reign supreme. Aided by Captain Anastasia Sixsmyth and the crew of the airship Everness, Everett hatches a desperate plan to save his father.
","Ian McDonald is an award-winning writer of science fiction for adults, and he makes a smooth transition to the YA market with this opening installment in a new series.

The eccentric characters -- heroes and villains alike -- have enough reality and emotional complexity to be compelling.

The Outliers,"Page-turner thriller is full of twists, violence.","THE OUTLIERS follows Wylie Lang, a Boston-area teen who doesn't leave her house and has acute anxiety and agoraphobia. Four months after her mother died in an accident, she remains unable even to go to school, and neither her twin brother nor her researcher father understands. Everything changes the moment her best (and only) friend Cassie turns up missing. Cassie's boyfriend, Jasper -- whom Wylie temporarily suspects is responsible -- shows up at Wylie's house to tell her that he got unsettling texts from Cassie commanding him to go to Wylie's and not tell anyone they heard from her. The texts compel Wylie out of the house, and she and Jasper (both of whom have had issues with Cassie recently) drive north on an action-packed road trip to find her. What they find instead is a mysterious, dangerous group rounding up people who possess extraordinary emotional intelligence. Lies, betrayal, and violence ensue.
","Despite the occasionally convoluted plot, this psychological thriller will keep readers engaged until they figure out what's going on and how the main character can survive various obstacles. The Outliers doesn't always make a lot of sense, but if readers are willing to suspend their disbelief, they will find themselves rooting for Wylie and Jasper. The two aren't even really friends when they first set off together (as is fairly common between the best friend and the boyfriend), but they develop a hesitant alliance that eventually turns into a trust and an openness they don't share with anyone else. Their slow burn of a friendship (with hints of romance to come) is one of the strongest parts of the story.
The weakest parts are the multiple conspiracy theories and competing groups trying to control the titular ""Outliers"" with almost superpower-like instinctive and perceptive abilities. It's best not to get bogged down in the plot holes and muddled aspects of what the Outliers are capable of and what various government and nefarious forces want with them. The author must be saving the clarity (and romance) for the next installment of the trilogy, but in the meantime at least this one is a quick read.","Parents need to know that The Outliers is the first book in a thriller trilogy about a teen who sets off to search for her missing best friend and ends up in danger herself. There are underlying mysteries and conspiracies that might confuse younger teen readers, especially if they aren't well-versed in psychological thrillers and suspense books. The language is regularly strong (""f--k,"" ""f--king,"" ""motherf--king,"" ""a--hole,"" ""s--t""), and one character has a history of underage drinking and marijuana use, but there is little sex outside of references to a character cheating on her boyfriend. There are  couple moments of intense hand-holding. The violence can be harrowing at times, and characters die -- either by gunshot or by burning to death. Although the teens make many questionable and dangerous decisions, Wylie and Jasper learn to work together despite their differences, trust their instincts, and look out for each other.

Foul Is Fair,"Dark, violent revenge tale is a teen update of ""Macbeth.""","In FOUL IS FAIR, Elle Khanjara goes out for a big night with her friends on her 16th birthday. They attend an exclusive party thrown by kids from St. Andrew's Prep, the fanciest private school in town. She's given a drugged drink and is raped by four boys, all of whom are lacrosse stars and rule the halls of St. Andrew's. Her memories are sketchy, but she pieces together most of what happened that night, including who mixed and gave her the drink, who attacked her, and who the rapists' friends are who knew what was going on but didn't stop it. She and her friends devise a plan to kill or destroy everyone involved. She changes her appearance, enrolls at St. Andrew's, and starts going by her middle name, Jade. Over the course of two weeks, she manipulates people into committing murders and upends the social hierarchy at the school. One by one, the guilty teens pay the price for their crimes, but suspicion and paranoia threaten to derail her plan.
","This over-the-top revenge tale starts out intense and juicy but gets bogged down by its melodramatic style. The loosely Macbeth-based action and plot of Foul Is Fair requires readers to suspend their disbelief throughout the story, but author Hannah Capin provides an insightful look at the ways privileged men get away with terrible acts -- in this case, rape -- and how they're abetted by associates and institutions who look the other way in order to preserve their own status and standing. After she is assaulted, Jade becomes single-minded in her quest for violent, murderous revenge.
Over the course of the book, it becomes clear that Jade and her friends are sociopaths, which makes it hard to relate to them, even though their rage and drive for vengeance is well founded. In fact, pretty much all the characters are horrible people and one-dimensional. It's not necessary for books to have likable characters, but few of these characters and their actions are relatable in any way, making it hard to engage with the story. And for a book that takes place over two weeks and jumps right into the action, the pace is plodding at times. This is due mostly to the repetitive nature of the writing, especially the dialogue, which is overly dramatic and unnatural to the point of being tedious. Capin occasionally provides a realistic glimpse of the deep trauma Jade's dealing with, but those few scenes only serve to highlight how over-the-top the rest of the story is.","Parents need to know that Foul Is Fair is a modern take on William Shakespeare's Macbeth, set in ultra-rich neighborhoods of Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. After a teen girl is drugged and gang-raped at a party, she enacts a violent, deadly plan for revenge. Helping her are her three friends, who fill the roles of the witches to her Lady Macbeth. The story is violent, with multiple murders and lots of violent imagery. Teens with seemingly no parental supervision do pretty much whatever they want, whenever they want. There is lots of drinking, some drug use, sex, and frequent profanity (including ""f--k,"" ""s--t"" and their variations). Though the story is fantastical, it explores trauma, how men get away with rape and abuse, the ways the powerful gain and maintain their power, and the destructive complicity of people who know about horrible acts but don't speak up. The violence, misogyny, and rape flashbacks might be too intense for younger or sensitive readers.

The problem is, they can't trust anyone, not even each other. Everyone they encounter has a secret, deadly agenda that could result in their death.
","A lot of trilogies tend to sag in the middle, but this second volume takes the action and intrigue to a new level. With The Empress, author S.J.

Latkes and Applesauce: A Hanukkah Story,Folksy tale shares the miracle of simple things.,"When a blizzard nearly buries their village in snow on the first night of Hanukkah, the Menashe family has to celebrate without their usual latkes and applesauce, and they are faced with the realization that the storm may last for the entire eight-day celebration. Though they are disappointed, they create a festive spirit as best they can. On the very last day, a winter miracle makes it a Hanukkah to remember.
","Though this is a new story, it sounds a lot like a familiar, comforting folk tale that might have been passed down through the generations. Its tone is simple, the language folksy, and the message loving in a very traditional way. The small family lives in a candlelit cottage in a time far away in the past, and their story gives a new and pleasant twist to the miracle of Hanukkah.
The chalk-drawn illustrations by Robin Spowart are amazing, even in the paperback edition. Inside the house, soft, golden candlelight floods the shadowed background of each room with a warmth that positively glows. Outside, snow swirls in a blue-black cold until finally it settles into a peaceful mound of silver-blue light under a star-speckled sky. Rounded lines and gentle curves, nothing too startling in its contrast, create the perfect enhancement for this gentle tale. Even readers who don't celebrate Hanukkah will feel the happiness that emanates from both the text and the illustrations of this book. They will also appreciate the explanation of the holiday as well as the recipe for potato latkes and instructions for playing dreidel that follow.","Parents need to know that this pleasant little tale presents a positive, friendly message.

It's compelling to watch protagonist Alex struggle with her desire to honor her friend's bucket-list wishes versus her desire not to step outside her comfort zone. Her character can be aggravating at times, especially when she's cynical and cruel.
The number of graphic sex scenes is off-putting, in that a good percentage of the book deals with characters having sex, talking about sex, or thinking about sex. Some of the sex scenes do serve to show how the characters deal with their grief, but the author could have accomplished this in a less gratuitous way. The concept of the bucket list stalls out a bit in the middle of the book, which is a shame because it's a good premise that deserves to be explored more.","Parents need to know that The F- It List realistically portrays the way teens think and act. There are a lot of graphic sex scenes that include masturbation and oral sex. All the teen characters swear profusely. The bonds of friendship among characters are explored and tested. Alex, the protagonist, is forced to deal with the trauma of her father's death, infidelity, and her best friend's cancer. The book ultimately offers up a positive message of the value of friendship and the need to openly deal with life's tough issues.

The Naturals,"Teens vs. serial killer in implausible, confusing thriller.","Years ago, Cassie's mother was killed, but her body was never found. This has haunted Cassie through childhood and into her teens, and she misses her mother very much. She lives with her grandmother but feels she doesn't belong. So, when the FBI recruits Cassie because of her \""natural\"" ability to gauge people's emotions and background information just from looking at them, she jumps at the chance to change her life. She ends up living in Virginia with a group of other teens who have special abilities (e.g., pathological lying, mathematical deductive reasoning), whom the FBI believes will help solve cold murder cases. While solving a major case, Cassie hopes she also can find the answers to her mother's murder.
","The concept behind THE NATURALS is kind of interesting, but it doesn't work for various reasons. The big one: It's hard to accept the premise that the FBI would hire a bunch of kids (who aren't even attending high school) to solve crimes, especially ones involving serial killers. At one point, Cassie wonders if the FBI even knows the ""Naturals"" program exists, except for the two agents who recruited her. Readers may suspend disbelief for the sake of pure entertainment, but the novel's all over the place. It's predictable and full of cliches (a love triangle, insta-love, missing parents) and has unlikable characters. Barnes seems to have done some research into the mind of a serial killer. However, she doesn't convey how the FBI really works and that being a criminal profiler takes more than just reading books at the library and checking people out at the mall. The Naturals is trying too hard to be a teen version of Silence of the Lambs. Some parts are suspenseful and creepy, but there's a lot of information that pops up out of the blue, leaving readers wondering if they missed something. Also, the ending is extremely confusing -- who killed who, who's bad, and who's good? ","Parents need to know that THE NATURALS is the first book in a mystery/thriller series pitched by author Jennifer Lynn Barnes as The Mentalist-meets-Pretty Little Liars. It's about a girl named Cassie, who's recruited to work with the FBI to solve cold murder cases. Cassie lives with a small group of fellow teens with special, ""natural"" abilities in Quantico, Virg., where the FBI is located. They're trained in behavioral and psychological techniques, as well as in analyzing crime scenes, to catch serial killers. Scenes of kidnappings, murder, and torture are described. Characters are stabbed, shot, seriously hurt, and killed. There's mild flirting and one shared kiss. No strong language.

Presenting Buffalo Bill: The Man Who Invented the Wild West,"Lively, thought-provoking look at showman and his era.","In PRESENTING BUFFALO BILL, frontier boy William Cody becomes his family's sole support at 11 when his father dies, and he's quickly swept up in the era's events, including the Pony Express, the Civil War, and the ongoing bloodbaths involving American settlers and the native tribes whose land they took. When, a bit later, he also discovers show business, a legend is born, and soon handsome, striking ""Buffalo Bill"" brings  highly fictionalized spectacle of the ""Wild West"" to adoring audiences around the world.
","Candace Fleming's compelling portrait balances the showman's promotional ""biography"" (which started in his early career) against the historical record, with lots of images to bring the era to life. As she looks at a violent, eventful period through the lens of one man's career, there's adventure, humor, bluster, and heartbreaking tragedy. Presenting Buffalo Bill offers 21st century readers much to consider as they learn more about events and issues that still fuel bitter conflict today.
Author Fleming offers plenty of opportunity to consider the grotesque absurdity of the show-biz Wild West and reality, as in this much-documented scene, describing the death of Sitting Bull:
""Four weeks later, Mc Laughlin attempted to arrest Sitting Bull during an early morning raid on his cabin. The chief's followers resisted.
""Hearing the shots, Sitting Bull's horse -- the gray pony Bill had given him -- thought it was the cue for his Wild West act. As bullets whizzed around him, the riderless pony went through his routine, high-stepping to the left and right, prancing in a circle.
""Sitting Bull and eight of his followers fell to the ground, dead.
""And the gray pony, coming to the end of his routine, stood in the middle of (the) carnage and raised one hoof in the air.""","Parents need to know that Presenting Buffalo Bill: The Man Who Invented the Wild West, by popular biographer Candace Fleming (The Family Romanov), traces the rise and self-created legend of showman William Cody, known as Buffalo Bill. The book lso examines one of the most exciting, adventurous, and viciously bloodthirsty periods of American history. The era included the Civil War , the frequent betrayal and massacre of Native Americans, who fought back, and the slaughter of thousands of bison.

Cover-up: Mystery at the Super Bowl,"Suspenseful, satisfying sports mystery.","Stevie and Susan Carol are 14-year-olds with their own cable sports show who, in the two previous books, have had major scoops solving mysteries at big sporting events. Now they're about to head to the biggest event of all: the Super Bowl. But just before they go, the network fires Stevie, and hires a dimwitted boy-band singer to work with Susan.
Stevie goes anyway, under the auspices of his mentor, a reporter for the Herald, and is immediately picked up to do some reports for CBS as well. Soon he and Susan get wind of a major story: The entire front line of one of the teams has tested positive for banned growth hormone HGH, and the owner is covering it up. But before they can run with the story, they need proof.
","Young readers will enjoy watching kids give adults their richly deserved comeuppance in this entertaining tale.
John Feinstein, sports reporter for print publications and NPR, knows the world in which he sets the story -- not just the world of professional sports, but that of the media who cover it. Football is just the setting for a story about gifted teen writers achieving success in the professional adult world.
While Feinstein infuses the details with the kind of gritty realism you'd expect from someone with his background, the overall plot is a sportswriter's fantasy of the Big Story that falls perfectly into his lap. But it's that very perfection that makes this so satisfying. Add to that some terrific suspense and an outcome that's never really in doubt, and you have something akin to the old Mission: Impossible TV series, in which the suspense and pleasure come from watching it all fall neatly together. ","Parents need to know that this book is very mild by young adult standards; ""hell"" and ""damn"" are said a few times, there's some non-explicit kissing, and the mystery involves illegal growth-enhancing drugs used by athletes.

Boy Kills Man,Powerful but mature novel about child assassins.,"Sonny and Alberto are best friends on the mean streets of Medellin, Columbia. They hang out together and protect each other, working together in small-time crime, such as selling contraband cigarettes. So Sonny is shocked when Alberto becomes one of the sicarios, child assassins used by drug lords because they are easy to control, manipulate, and dispose of. Alberto's gun and money give him prestige and respect in the neighborhood, and his determination to keep Sonny out of it tests their friendship. But when Alberto disappears, Sonny's way is cleared, and he no longer has anything to lose.
","This is rough stuff, make no mistake. Every now and then we hear something on the nightly news about the drug wars, the narcotrafficantes, the gangs and militia in Columbia, but it takes something like this powerful book to make it real, especially to teens. While the events depicted here are horrific, author Matt Whyman does keep the reader at some emotional distance. Ordinarily this would be a criticism, but here it's more like praise. These are characters with a miserable present and no future, and readers will be disturbed enough without having emotionally identified with Sonny and Alberto. But the book will still have a powerful impact on your kids, and parents should be prepared to discuss the intense material.","Parents need to know that this is a rough book, both in content and in subject. There is swearing, brutal violence (several murders are described, including one with a baseball bat), drugs, alcohol, and smoking. But none of this is as disturbing as the subject: child assassins working for Medellin drug lords. Through this story, readers will learn about the hardships these kids face, and understand better why they make the choices they do. They will also be asked to think about some critical questions, from who is to blame for the drug war, to when someone stops being a victim and becomes a criminal.

Going Bovine,"Edgy, quirky road trip fantasy skewers reality TV and more.","When Cameron, a high-school slacker, finds out he has fatal mad cow disease, he sets out on an epic quest to find a cure and maybe save the world, too. Accompanied by his friends -- Gonzo, a dwarf, and Balder, a Viking god disguised as a long-suffering yard gnome (don't ask) -- Cameron faces an increasingly bizarre series of misadventures involving a punk angel, New Orleans jazz musicians, and snow globes in this very postmodern retelling of Don Quixote.
","Fans of Bray's Gemma Doyle trilogy (A Great and Terrible Beauty) will recognize the alternative-world fantasy elements in this book, but any resemblance ends there. Though the middle section stretches too long as Cameron moves from one absurd situation to the next, readers will stick with Bovine for its male bonding and humorous send-ups of fast-food restaurants, self-esteem, and reality shows. The over-the-top elements ultimately serve a quieter purpose, asking teens to ponder what it means to really live an engaged life.","Parents need to know this wacky novel features a teenager's death, a punk angel, and plenty of edgy behavior by teens (condom-free sex, drinking, pot-smoking, and running away).

Her birthday wish is for a little sister, but when baby Amy dies, she goes ""grief mad"" and runs away. Based on tales from her own family, author Jennifer L. Holm creates a believable heroine in a realistic historical setting.
 ","This historical novel vividly captures the harsh and lonely life of a girl living in the Pacific Northwest at the turn of the 20th century. The author builds excitement and suspense into each chapter: Chased by an angry mother bear and a cougar and nearly swept away by logs sent downriver from a logging camp, May Amelia seems to remain alive only by virtue of a string of luck. And readers learn that some things don't change in a hundred years: Brothers and sisters argue, parents set rules, and children run away.
To write this story, Holm delved into her family history: Her great-grandfather was one of the first Finnish-American settlers in the Nasel River Valley, but it was her grand-aunt's diary that inspired the title character.","Parents need to know that though May Amelia is a girl, this book has boy appeal too; six brothers and a male cousin share in her adventures.

This is the second book in the Flower Power Book series; the first is Luv Ya Bunches.
","There's a lot packed into the book, and the author has written it in a decidedly contemporary tween voice, which can be overly sweet with its liberal use of exclamation points and italics. Readers may find the diversity too forced and simplified -- none of the major problems the girls face are about their ethnicity, race, or the sexual preference of their parents. But the messages are very positive, and much about their elementary-school life is realistic.","Parents need to know a girl gets taunted about her ""boobies"" by some boys.

After following Joseph into the unknown, Zita arrives on a strange planet full of aliens and robots, all who are concerned about the impending asteroid strike to their planet. As she searches the planet for her friend, she meets several friendly misfits, like the helpful but not-too-bright Strong Strong, a giant mouse that she rides on, and a resentful robot named One. She also finds a fellow human space traveler named Piper, who may or may not help her find her friend and get back home.
","Elements of The Wizard of Oz nd the Pied Piper story wrapped up in a wonderfully monster-populated alien world make for a captivating and suspense-filled science fiction journey for young readers. Girls especially will enjoy the normal-girl-turned-hero story that nicely ties bravery and warmheartedness together.

Pre-reading kids can probably follow the story thanks to the clean but detailed panels, but it will be lots of fun to read aloud, too.

Return,Wondrous finale to fantastical wordless trilogy.,"In RETURN, the young girl we met in the previous two books again tries to catch the attention of her artist dad working at his drafting table, hoping they'll fly her red kite. But again, he's too distracted, so she uses her red crayon to draw the door in her room that opens to her magical kingdom. This time, the dad follows. A boat awaits him nd takes him to meet the young boy and king who've been her fellow adventurers. But when the king is captured by the villains, the girl and father together use the crayon to draw a submarine that takes them to an underground cave with ancient cave paintings that recount the past stories and point the way to the story's solution. Girl and dad draw a trap for the villains, freeing them to return to their city life where they at last fly her red kite.
","Art and imagination can transport us, and so can this beautiful picture book, third in a wordless trilogy that takes its heroine on a magical adventure and carries the reader along for the ride. A girl and her friends create their own adventures with crayons, and the world they imagine is beautiful but dangerous, so they draw their way out of harm by creating a griffin and a submarine to help them escape their pursuers. Though the book can stand on its own, it features the same players we've met before and the same threat, which is at last satisfyingly resolved, so it may be most fun and meaningful when paired with the previous two books.

Finding Winnie: The True Story of the World's Most Famous Bear,Moving story of bear that inspired Winnie-the-Pooh.,"FINDING WINNIE: THE TRUE STORY OF THE WORLD'S MOST FAMOUS BEAR is the story of the inspiration for A.A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh and is told as three stories in one. The most prominent is the story of Harry Colebourn, a young Canadian veterinarian/soldier who ships off to World War I and en route saves a young bear cub whom he names Winnie, short for his hometown of Winnipeg. When his unit is sent to combat, he takes Winnie to live at the London Zoo. That story's told as a bedtime story to Harry's great-great-grandson by his mom, who supplies family details, supplemented by a family album that includes old photos and diary entries. Once Winnie's at the zoo, the book shifts to the third story, told separately though clearly connected. When A.A. Milne brings his young son, Christopher Robin, to the zoo, the boy befriends the bear and names his own stuffed bear after his new friend, giving birth to the Winnie-the-Pooh stories.
","Winner of the 2016 Caldecott Medal, this artful tale covers a lot of ground, but readers are carried along by the transporting detail in the art. The bear cub, rescued at a desolate whistle stop in Canada, is adorable, cuddly as a kitten. And the scenes of the soldiers give a graphic sense of the scope and daily detail of the war. Author Lindsay Mattick skillfully handles some difficult subjects -- what trappers do, the fate of soldiers at war -- and uses lyrical language. For example, when Harry's on the train, he watches ""the land scroll by.""
Illustrator Sophie Blackall cleverly orients the reader and aids the instruction. On a page about the family tree, she draws an actual tree, with each generation perched on a branch. Later, an ""album"" she pictures in the story segues into actual photos and diary entries from the time. This is a rich book that begs for repeated readings.","Parents need to know that Lindsay Mattick's Finding Winnie: The True Story of the World's Most Famous Bear, which won the 2016 Caldecott Medal for illustrator Sophie Blackall (The Baby Tree, Ivy + Bean), is a nonfiction picture book about the real-bear inspiration for the children's classic Winnie-the-Pooh -- though it reads like spellbinding fiction. The story is complex, written as three stories in one, so it could be confusing for kids under 4. The true story is told as a bedtime tale by the author, who's actually the great-granddaughter of the protagonist, and begins in Canada, when a young veterinarian, a soldier in World War I, saves a bear cub and brings her with his unit to Europe. Before they see active fighting, he gives the bear, Winnie, to the London Zoo, where she's befriended by Christopher Robin, the son of A.A. Milne. And the rest, of course, is literary history.

Hero Mom,Simple book has positive message for kids of military moms.,"In HERO MOM, a diverse range of children discuss how proud they are of their military moms and the ways in which the women resemble heroes or superheroes for their courage and skill during deployment.
","Hero Mom takes a difficult subject -- family separation during deployment -- and presents it as a point of pride for children. Kids can explain to others that their mothers are gone but are doing something extremely important, whether they're transporting cargo, repairing aircraft, or leading a battalion. The book makes a point of showing the way moms who are deployed show love for their children with letters or by email or video chat. And the soft watercolor illustrations give the book an expressive, sentimental feel.

Little Red Riding Hood,Captivating artwork makes classic wolf tale howl.,"Little Red Riding Hood runs into the wolf on the way to her grandmother's house. Though warned by her mother not to delay, she stops to talk with him before going on her way. They meet up again when he is posing as the grandmother in the hope of devouring her. However, the day is saved by a woodcutter who happens to be passing by.
","Just knowing that this version of LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD was created by Jerry Pinkney should tip readers off to its quality. His artwork alone brings an amazing depth to this classic tale, which in his telling goes beyond the expected. He brings a multicultural sensitivity to a story that has long been part of a European tradition. And his language is poetic and captivating.
With pencil, watercolor, gouache, and ink on paper, Pinkney has filled each page with a scene that is expressive, delicate, strong, colorful, realistic, and imaginative all at the same time. The soft features of Little Red, her mother, and grandmother glow with sincerity. The woods silently filled with snow-covered birch and fir as well as creatures that seem ever-watchful help build a definite tension. The very realistic wolf almost seems to smile, though something in his face subtly says he is up to no good. And this is just the artwork: The language itself takes the traditional and makes it more. Poetic and pleasant, nothing is dumbed down here as modern retellings sometimes are. All senses are stimulated. Readers can smell the chicken soup simmering in the cozy kitchen, taste the snowflakes, hear the crunching of the snow and the chopping of the woodsman and feel the peaceful crisp cold of the forest. Of course, they have an amazing number of things to look at. If you want to own one version of Little Red Riding Hood other than the original, this is definitely the one to have.","Parents need to know that this version of Grimm's traditional fairytale is true to the original. The leering wolf eats the grandmother and then is killed by the heroic woodsman who saves the day. However, nothing too gory is shown.

"Midnight Jewel: The Glittering Court, Book 2","Companion novel takes Mira's perspective, ups the romance.","MIDNIGHT JEWEL is the second book in Richelle Mead's The Glittering Court alternate-universe -- a three-part tale that revisits the same timeline from a different perspective in each book. While The Glittering Court explores the story of Adelaide's time in the titular bride-for-hire service, Midnight Jewel follows Mira, the only Sirminican (darker-skinned ethnic minority) of the court, and why she joins the group of beautiful young women who agree to be married off across the sea in Adoria (the New World that's reminiscent of colonial America). Mira needs money to save her older brother, Lonzo, from being a bonded laborer, and if it means marrying an older and open-minded Adorian, so be it. But Mira's feelings change when she meets Grant, a secret agent working to uncover treason and injustice among the ruling class in the New World. Mira agrees to spy on the influential men she meets during Glittering Court events and falls for the ""infuriatingly attractive"" and no-strings-attached Grant in the process.
","Mead's companion novel retells the story of Book 1 from the perspective of a more fearless protagonist whose love story is even more intense than the first book's romance. Ideal for romance fans who like some adventure and intrigue (all Mead's specialties), Midnight Jewel manages to re-create the events of Glittering Court without being repetitive. Instead, Mead infuses the story with more clarity that will make readers think, ""Ohhhh, that's what was happening"" when they revisit some pivotal moments from the first book. And then there are completely new parts about the mysterious Mira, her relationship with Grant, and her true aim in Adoria -- not for a rich husband but to free a beloved brother.
About that romance -- it's not the slow-burn, forbidden love that Adelaide and Cedric experience. It's the one about the gorgeous man with no interest in attachment who finally finds a woman worthy of commitment. It's not a favorite romantic storyline, but it's difficult not to cheer for the beautiful and fierce Mira or the complicated and protective Grant. They think they can keep things simple, but nothing worth fighting for is ever simple, they realize. There's also an interesting subplot where Mira gets to play an avenging angel, a Robin Hood-esque vigilante who will be familiar to those who remember the first book. But it's really Mira's devotion to her loved ones -- Grant, Adelaide, her brother Lonzo -- that make her such a likable ""underdog"" (because even breathtakingly beautiful, courageous, and clever young women are still underdogs when they're the wrong class and the wrong skin color).","Parents need to know that Midnight Jewel is best-selling author Richelle Mead's second installment in her Glittering Court fantasy trilogy set in an alternate universe that resembles colonial America. But instead of a typical sequel, the story chronicles the same timeline of the first book from a different perspective. Whereas the first book was a romantic adventure following Adelaide, this one follows Mira, Adelaide's best friend. The story tackles mature themes such as ""bride for hire"" marriage, sexism, religious freedom, and colonialism but also features a steamy romance, adventure, and mystery. Unlike the ""forbidden romance"" of Adelaide's book, Mira's love story follows a different friends-with-benefits to true-love trajectory. As in nearly all of Mead's books, there are candid but not graphic descriptions of consenting sexual relationship between young adults. There's also violence that includes vigilant justice, references to religion-based murders, an assassination attempt, explosions, and other violent encounters.

"The Terror of the Southlands: The Very Nearly Honorable League of Pirates, Book 2","Girl battles scallywags, ball gowns in fast-paced sequel.","It's true: Young Hilary Westfield  (aka THE TERROR OF THE SOUTHLANDS) is now a member of the Very Honorable League of Pirates. But there's still some grumbling about the League's first female member, and she's soon ordered to prove herself with faraway adventures. Almost immediately, though, her plans change, because Miss Pimm, finishing-school headmistress and the Enchantress, has disappeared. Hilary thinks it's perfectly piratical to help a friend in need, but soon she and her crew (her friends Charlie, Claire, and a self-important gargoyle) are battling buccaneers and scallywags and facing terrible dangers, from flying cannonballs to a High Society ball. ","As in Magic Marks the Spot, author Caroline Carlson delivers a fast-moving, mostly lighthearted romp of a pirate adventure, with a few positive life lessons and quite a few laughs for good measure. Independent-minded tween girls will find it especially easy to relate to the young Terror's troubles (""Poor Mother,"" Hilary muses. ""I believe she would have been much happier with a daughter who could actually stand to wear a dress for more than half a minute"").  Carlson punctuates the narrative with newspaper stories, ransom notes, pirate missives, chapters from the gargoyle's memoirs, and lots of ""arrr""s, offering plenty of opportunities for read-aloud drama.","Parents need to know that The Terror of the Southlands, the latest installment in Caroline Carlson's Very Nearly Honorable League of Pirates series, continues the adventures of intrepid (and honorable) young pirate Hilary Westfield. As in Magic Marks the Spot, Hilary and her unlikely band are appealing, brave, and often funny, and, although there's much piratical talk of running people through with swords, somehow it never seems to happen. Along the way, there are many positive messages about friendship, loyalty, and the way someone's strangest quirks can really save the day. Sensitive kids may wonder about the fact that Hilary's father is in a dungeon for his villainous behavior in Book 1, and Hilary says many times that she hopes he stays there; in the distant past, another character's pirate parents died when Hilary's father sank their ship.

"Spy School, Book 1","Clever, fast-paced mystery mixes spy thrills and teen drama.","Nerdy, awkward Ben Ripley has just been recruited to a top secret spy school for future CIA operatives, but why? Is he a master cryptologist without even knowing it, or just a patsy who's decent in math? Unfortunately for him, there isn't much time to answer that question, or do much studying. Under the guidance of suave older spy Alexander, his new friend Murray the slacker, and the enigmatic and beautiful fellow student Erica, he'll face assassins, bullies, top secret projects, and a labyrinth of secret passages. Along the way, he'll have to learn who's for real, why he's really there, and how to get out alive.
","SPY SCHOOL's a fun, fast-paced read for middle schoolers up to teens. Author Stuart Gibbs manages to drop in the kind of allusions to old-school spy films and TV shows from James Bond to Mission Impossible, while believably inhabiting the real-world concerns of teens: fitting in, being attractive to the opposite pants, not being mortified in front of your peers every five seconds. It traffics in the tropes of the genre -- weapons, danger, fisticuffs -- but Gibbs does it with such humor, nonchalance, and smarts that the reader feels in on the joke. Kids who identify as nerds or brainiacs will enjoy a book where being smart and quick-witted are an asset worthy of instant popularity, and the author doesn't talk down to them or shy away from using a sophisticated vocabulary (word of the day: soporific). Parents can appreciate the positive messages about intelligence, and a strong female heroine in Erica, who outfoxes everyone she comes into contact with.","Parents need to know that Spy School is a mystery about recruiting teens to be future CIA operatives. It reads like a teen-friendly distillation of a James Bond film -- weapons, gadgets, girls -- with an unexpected angle that shows the glamor is never all its cracked up to be. So while the familiar violence and peril of the genre are present (fistfights, the tossing of nunchucks or throwing stars, being shot at, threats and intimidation), it's all done with a very tongue-in-cheek, lighthearted attitude that translates into little real injury or bloodshed, but a lot of suspense. No swearing beyond the occasional ""damn,"" and the only sexual content is boys' occasional innuendo and banter regarding the attractiveness of their female classmates.

How It Feels to Float,"Teen battles mental illness in unforgettable, hopeful story.","As HOW IT FEELS TO FLOAT AWAY begins, Elizabeth Martin Grey (known to everyone as Biz) is about to start her junior year of high school in a town south of Sydney, Australia. She has a close group of friends (""The Posse"") and a best friend named Grace. She also has a secret. Her father, who died when she was 7, still visits and talks with her. He's become a constant and reassuring presence amid the increasing emotional turmoil of her life. Biz also believes his death was her fault, that she was the reason he ""was sad."" She's barely holding it together when a series of events throw her life into a tailspin. After a drunken beach party, a boy tells everyone he had sex with her, which she denies. The Posse believes him and Biz is exiled from the group. She begins seeing a psychologist and eventually takes a trip to the farm where her father was born, as she tries to unravel both his life and his death.
","This brutally honest story of mental illness is beautifully written and deeply moving. It doesn't spare readers, though -- they're with Biz during the terror of panic attacks and the disorientation of hallucinations. How It Feels to Float Away is just as much a story of hope and power of love and friendship.
While some teens might question how much they could have in common with a girl battling a serious mental illness, any reader who's ever experienced grief, felt betrayed by a friend, or begun to have questions about their sexuality will be able to relate to Biz and her struggles.","Parents need to know that Helena Fox's How It Feels to Float is narrated by 17-year-old Elizabeth Martin Grey (Biz), who lives in a town south of Sydney, Australia. She's never told anyone that her father, who died when she was 7, has regularly been visiting and talking with her. Not even her mother or her closest friend, Grace, fully realize the extent of Biz's mental illness. She's trying to cope as best she can, but things begin to spiral out of control for her in the aftermath of a drunken beach party. Teens regularly get drunk and there's lots and lots of profanity (""s--t,"" ""f--k,"" ""a--hole,"" ""dick""). A boy sexts a picture of his penis to a girl he wants to date. A boy pulls down a girl's underwear and puts his hands between her legs, and she stops and runs off. And a girl very briefly describes her first sexual experience. While Biz is exploring her sexuality (she kisses Grace and then decides she wants to have sex with a boy) this isn't a major storyline.

The Revolution of Birdie Randolph,Timeless novel about first love and family solidarity.,"When THE REVOLUTION OF BIRDIE RANDOLPH begins, Dove, nicknamed Birdie, arrives at her family's apartment to find that her aunt Carlene has come to stay for a while. She learns Carlene has a long history of substance abuse, but is now clean and sober, and participating in Alcoholics Anonymous. Meanwhile Birdie is falling in love with Booker, a teen with a very different class background and a troubled past, and she hides that information from her parents. Desire to be with Booker, her relationship with her aunt, and a family secret lead Birdie to break out of her lifelong role as the perfectly behaved daughter.
","This coming-of-age novel could become a classic and belongs in that rare company of books that capture what it feels like to be a teenager. Though some of the issues Birdie and her friends face in The Revolution of Birdie Randolph re contemporary (like vaping and asexuality), most are timeless: dating a boy your parents might not approve of, finding an aunt you can confide in about things you can't discuss with Mom, awakening to who your parents are as people, and the rocky path toward independence and adulthood. ","Parents need to know that Brandy Colbert's The Revolution of Birdie Randolph is a coming-of-age novel about a 16-year-old African American girl who loses her innocence over a very eventful summer. In the time between her sophomore and junior years in high school, Birdie falls in love, loses her virginity, learns a shocking family secret, experiments with alcohol, and defies her parents' orders and wishes for the first time. The loss of virginity is a major subplot; there are many heavy make-out scenes and an explicit scene when Birdie has intercourse with her boyfriend for the first time. There's also  discussion of an extramarital affair, and two boys are in a same-sex relationship. Underage teens drink alcohol to the point of tipsiness in a number of scenes. A couple of the adult characters are depicted as regular smokers. A teen boy vapes marijuana; he claims he does it to cure anxiety but shares it with other kids in social situations. Two characters are recovering addicts. There are flashbacks to ""using,"" including bringing an infant to a crack house. The word ""f--k"" is used several times throughout the text.

The narrative then flashes back in time to explain the geological, economic and environmental factors that led to the drought. It charts the struggles of the millions of Americans who were affected by the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl.
","The Great American Dust Bowl simplifies the story of one of the United States' biggest ecological disasters, without robbing it of its historical and continuing significance. Author-illustrator Don Brown clearly presents the geological, meteorological, and ecological factors behind the drought and Dust Bowl.
The illustrations contain a touch of whimsy that prevents the material from becoming too depressing. The book is a quick, enjoyable chronicle of a disastrous era in American history.","Parents need to know that The Great American Dust Bowl presents a simplified yet evocative history of one of the United States' most dire ecological disasters in graphic novel style.

The Curious World of Calpurnia Tate,Callie gets into science and scrapes in strong sequel.,"As Calpurnia Virginia Tate, aka Callie Vee, turns 13 in 1900, she revels in studying science with her cantankerous grandfather, with whom she codiscovered a new plant species in The Evolution of Calpurnia Tate. But a life of science doesn't seem to be in her future: Although her family is rich nd her six brothers can pursue their educations and follow their dreams, Callie can't. Destined from her unfortunate birth as a female for life as a Texas debutante and wealthy matron, she's furious as she feels the doors of the gilded cage closing in on her in a world where the fact that she's smarter and harder-working than her brothers doesn't matter a bit. As she tries to keep her tenderhearted brother Travis -- and his never-ending parade of rescued animals -- out of trouble, a flood 200 miles away brings to town two people who, in different ways, open up new worlds to Callie nd give her valuable tools for living her own life.
","Jacqueline Kelly's follow-up to The Evolution of Calpurnia Tate works well as a standalone story, but readers of the first volume will find THE CURIOUS WORLD OF CALPURNIA TATE a happy reunion. Old fans and new will be on the edges of their seats as Callie and her beloved brother land in numerous scrapes and fib, finagle, and charm their way out of quite a few others -- almost always with a kindhearted motive. For those who aren't as entranced with scientific pursuits as Callie, some of the experiments, dissections, and research might get old, but the detail is great for kids who love to investigate nature or think they might like to be veterinarians.
Though the story has an obvious appeal to smart, strong girls -- especially those who think they're not being taken seriously -- Callie's plight and creative thinking will resonate with any kid who feels imprisoned by the expectations of others. What spirited kid's blood would not boil at this exchange, as Callie's father gives her a five-dollar gold piece for Christmas:
""I thought of all the scientific equipment I could buy, maybe even a third-hand microscope of my own.
""'Save it now and spend it wisely in the future,' he said. 'perhaps on your hope chest and your trousseau.'""","Parents need to know that The Curious World of Calpurnia Tate continues the adventures of the smart, spirited girl introduced in Newbery Honor winner The Evolution of Calpurnia Tate. Here, Callie's turning 13 in rural Texas in 1900. Even as she's discovering the joys of science in her studies with her cranky, learned grandfather and dreaming of an education, the walls are closing in on her: She's just a girl, and the best she can look forward to is being a proper, wealthy matron like her mother. Meanwhile, she's kept busy looking out for her younger brother, Travis, and the steady stream of animals he ""rescues."" Callie's an irresistible protagonist as she struggles to make her dreams real against the odds; her kind heart and clever thinking, as well as her sharp wits, serve her and her loved ones well. There's a lot of scientific detail, including lots of gross moments involving animal bodily fluids and dissection. Tenderhearted readers may have trouble with the frequent deaths of animals. Parents might want to discuss period details that are historically accurate but jarring by today's standards, such as references to ""colored"" people, anti-Semitic characters, and outmoded gender stereotypes.

Flora and the Penguin,Girl gets a skating partner in wintry wordless whirl.,"Flora goes for a skate on natural outdoor ice, and suddenly a penguin pops out of a watery hole in the ice. She finds the bird a perfect partner for pair skating. They do all their graceful moves in unison until the penguin tries a spin and plunges plunges back through the hole. Soon it pops back up with a fish in its beak for Flora. She accepts it but then tosses it back in the hole, angering the penguin. So Flora removes a skate and uses her pom-pom-tipped shoelace as a fishing line. They work together to catch the fish, patch up their friendship, and return to skating happily together. ","Like Flora and the Flamingo, the delightful FLORA AND THE PENGUIN says a whole lot without using any words. Author-illustrator Molly Idle show these two just-met friends going through a range of emotions as they play together -- and apart -- on (and under) the ice. Kids will relate to the push-pull fight-and-make-up nature of many playdates. This book's pastel blue-and-white palette is as perfect for a winter skating story as previous outing's pastel pink-and-white was for its summer swimming story. And once again, well-placed flaps add dimension to shifting emotions and help drive the narrative. Here' hoping Flora has some more fun in mind for spring and autumn!","Parents need to know that Flora and the Penguin is the follow-up to Molly Idle's Caldecott Honor Book Flora and the Flamingo. Like the first book, it's a wordless story that follows young Flora and she teams up with a bird in a graceful duet, but this time it's on skates in a cold, icy landscape. With loads of charm and a range of emotions (happy, angry, worried, sad, suspicious, stubborn, happy again), there's plenty of story to tell out loud or for kids to ""read"" on their own.

"Hey, Kiddo",Big-hearted memoir of rocky childhood with addicted mom.,"In HEY, KIDDO, Jarrett lives with his troubled single mom. When she's caught shoplifting and the two of them end up at the police station, the grandparents push for custody and raise Jarrett. His unreliable mom occasionally appears in his life unexpectedly, but she's largely absent, missing birthdays, holidays, and graduations. Though Jarrett craves her love, his grandparents eventually reveal to him that she's a heroin addict and often in jail. Despite his challenges, Jarrett actively develops his talent as an artist, and makes the most of the cards he's been dealt.
","This graphic novel memoir doesn't candy-coat the heartrending pain of growing up with an addicted mom, but it's shot through with an infectious generosity of spirit nd hope. Hey, Kiddo helps us see events through Jarrett's young eyes. His unreliable mom makes a series of ""terrible decisions. Decisions that would forever alter our relationship as mother and son."" Since much of the pain's conveyed through art, in busy panels, readers can selectively absorb it as they're emotionally ready. For instance, a segment involving his mom's druggie friends is pictured but not described.
Krosoczka balances the grit with warmth nd gratitude for the gifts he was given. His grandparents, though hard-drinking, actively and enthusiastically encouraged his talent, as did caring, influential teachers and mentors. And the art's studded with poignant personal memorabilia, including Jarrett's early comics and art, lovingly saved by his grandparents -- a very telling detail.","Parents need to know that Hey, Kiddo is by Jarrett J. Krosoczka, author-illustrator of a host of very funny and imaginative middle grade and picture books, including the graphic novel series Lunch Lady, but the target age for this book starts at young teen. It's a frank but very moving memoir of growing up with a mom addicted to heroin. Though all is not bleak -- Jarrett's grandparents take him in, provide stability, and encourage his talent as an artist -- there's serious content. The mom is mostly absent -- she became addicted as a young teen and is in and out of rehab, halfway houses, and jail. The grandparents, though loving, are boozers, and when the grandmother hits the sauce, she swears and engages in coarse name-calling. Still, the overall feel of the book is hopeful and uplifting. Krosoczka gives credit to his grandparents and influential teachers, and even to his mom, in reproductions of actual letters and artwork she sent him at the time. This book will resonate strongly with kids affected by family substance abuse, but all can be stirred by this very moving redemptive human story.

Sourpuss and Sweetie Pie,"Every bit as good as Hello, Goodbye Window.","When their granddaughter comes to stay, Nanna and Poppy are never quite sure what mood she will be in. Sometimes she is Sweetie Pie, sometimes Sourpuss, and sometimes both rolled into one.
","One of the great wisdoms of SOURPUSS AND SWEETIE PIE is the fact that this is not an either/or situation. Though the little girl can act as one or the other, she is more often both at the same time. And there is really no rhyme or reason to why she swings back and forth. Kids, parents, and grandparents, will chuckle in recognition as they turn from page to page. As in The Hello, Goodbye Window, Chris Raschka's illustrations capture Juster's story perfectly, his colors and strokes changing subtly as the little girl's mood changes. While Sweetie Pie -- with her perky hair, eyes, and mouth -- she is awash in splashes of sunshiny bright colors. Sourpuss is much darker, a mouth turned down, eye's scrunched up, an angry body bathed in darker red, blues, browns, and grays.
And this is not a book just for kids. Readers young and old will be captivated and engaged not only by the artwork but by both the language and the message it carries. Most will find themselves muttering Wow! How many times have I heard (or said) that before? As a sequel, this book is every bit as good as the book it follows; together they are a perfect pair.","Parents need to know that this sequel to Norton Juster's Caldecott Winner The Hello, Goodbye Window speaks just as clearly to the real kinds of feelings kids have as did his first book.

Almost to Freedom,Moving story on plantation in antebellum Virginia.,"Set on a plantation in antebellum Virginia, the story is narrated by a rag doll named Sally. She belongs to a little girl named Lindy whose family is enslaved by the owners of the plantation. Lindy works in the cotton fields alongside her mother. Her father has been sold \""down the river\"" for promoting an idea that is still often talked about: Freedom. Sally does not know what or where this Freedom is, but she can see that it is important to the adults around Lindy. After Lindy is whipped by the overseer for asking the master's son how to spell her name, she and her mother escape one night and are reunited with Lindy's father. Together they travel on the Underground Railroad toward Freedom, but approaching slave catchers cause them to flee a safe house in the middle of the night -- and Sally is accidentally left behind. She stays alone in the hiding place until another little girl named Willa and her family arrive at the safe house. Sally is renamed Belinda and is happy to be in the arms of a little girl again.
","This moving tale is powerfully presented. Because of the time and the setting, there are many unhappy moments in the story; however, the warmth of the family and community connections, as well as the little girl's loving relationship with her doll, make the bad parts more bearable. Written in authentic dialect, the story is well told. The author draws the reader closely into the personal experience of enslavement, balancing unspeakable suffering with extreme courage and determination.
Using the voice, perspective, and naiveté of the doll offers a natural way to make a complicated historical situation more accessible for children. Illustrator Colin Bootman uses a dark palette with the soft illuminations of starlight and candlelight. In his historically accurate full-page and double-page spreads, the characters are alive with a huge range of emotions. ","Parents need to know that this book deals directly with many of the hardships endured by enslaved African-American people in the pre-Civil War South, from verbal and physical abuse on the plantation to the terrors on the dangerous Underground Railway. For children old enough to comprehend some aspects of the historical setting and political situation in the story, this is an emotionally rewarding and ultimately optimistic story.

The Evolution of Calpurnia Tate,Newbery Honor book about a smart Southern tomboy in 1899.,"In the summer 1899, Calpurnia Tate is almost 12 years old. ""Callie"" lives with six brothers, her parents, her grandfather (a founding member of the National Geographic Society), and numerous household staff on a Texas cotton plantation. During this long hot summer, Callie begins a new friendship with her grandfather when he discovers her interest in the natural world. Over the next few months, Callie has to deal with three of her brothers falling in ""love"" with her best friend, cooking and sewing lessons, installation of the first telephone in town history, and Darwin's theory of evolution. Callie may have the benefits of an upper-crust family and being the only girl among so many brothers, but she also faces the universal truth of growing up: Everything is changing.
","It's easy to see why this coming-of-age story earned a Newbery Honor: Readers will find plenty to like. This is a fun historical novel jam-packed with rich details and events. Readers will get a vivid sense of rural Southern life as the children catch fireflies, eat their pet turkeys for Thanksgiving, and enter the county fair. And in Callie they'll find a smart role model who tries to follow her heart, despite gender expectations. Each chapter begins with a quote from Darwin's The Origin of the Species, which mirrors Callie's own longing for the evolution of the roles of women.
Tweens and teens (and their parents) might find it fun to explore how their childhoods differ from Callie's -- both in terms of the technologies being developed and what expectations society has for boys and girls.","Parents need to know that since this Newbery Honor book is set in 1899, readers will learn a great deal about the period, including the limitations placed upon an intelligent girl. They'll find it easy to root for -- and relate to -- Callie, who attempts to do the thing she loves despite what society -- and her mother -- think is proper. This is a wonderful book about coming of age in a fascinating time, and that's what will leave an impression on tween and teen readers.
